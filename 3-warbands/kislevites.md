# Kislevite Warband
</div>

The land of Kislev lies to the north and east of the Empire. The further east one travels the dense forests give way to open steppes stretching to the foothills of the Worlds Edge Mountains. The winters of Kislev are harsh and cruelly long and for months the land is gripped by snow blizzards and ice. The townships of Kislev are mainly built of timber for stone is rare and only the most important of the cities have stone buildings and walls. In the ancient capital city of Kislev the massive white buildings are topped by vast gilded domes and decorated with golden statues and gargoyles. 

It has been said that Kislev is a poor country filled with rich people. It is certainly true that the people that live in this beleaguered land have an outlook on life that strangers often find surprisingly positive. For Kislev is a country under constant threat of invasion. Armies of savage Norse often venture into Kislev, raiding and pillaging, and to make matters worse Kislev lies right on the border of the Chaos Wastes, so that any Chaos incursion passes through the land (and its people) first. To aid them in their struggle against these murderous foes, the Tzars of Kislev have forged strong ties with the Empire. 

This alliance benefits both countries, as the rulers of the Empire have long understood the benefit of a northern bulwark against the tides of Chaos. Both countries have a tradition of sending troops to aid the other in times of need, and in fact the Gryphon Legion, pride of the Kislevite nobility, was formed as a symbol of the unity between the two countries. This knightly order is made up entirely of Kislevite nobles, but is garrisoned and trained in the Empire. Despite the constant threat of invading armies, the people of Kislev sing and dance and play as much as or perhaps more than the people of any other country in the Old World.

Some say that their relative happiness derives from their love of strong drink. Whether this is true or not, Kislevites certainly do enjoy their spirits, and in fact many of their people attribute almost magical qualities to that most famous of Kislevite drinks – vodka. A Kislevite warband represents a group of individuals from this unique northern realm. Kislevites tend to be quiet in the face of strangers, but they hold much joy in their hearts. In fact they are loud and boisterous when amongst their own people. Kislevites are known to be extremely brave warriors, and they hold a loathing for Chaos that is much stronger than most of the peoples of the Old World. 

While many citizens of  the Empire may remain ignorant to the initial signs of a Chaos cult, Kislevite citizens will immediately seek out any signs of depravity and cleanse the infected individuals with sword and flame. Keep these things in mind when you play a Kislev warband. Most citizens of Kislev have lost homes or loved ones to the warriors of Chaos, and they realise that anything less than constant vigilance could lead to their downfall. They are therefore unrelenting in their resolve against their ancient enemies. Give the forces of Chaos no quarter, and expect none in return.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ### Vodka
**(Once Per Battle)**	
A Kislevite Hero may give Vodka to the warband before the start of the game. Every warrior in the warband receives +1 Leadership (up to a maximum of 10) for that game. In addition because of its nullifying alcoholic effects every warband member (roll Henchmen groups together) must test against their Toughness before the start of the game – a failure resulting in -1 Initiative for the duration of the game. Any amount of vodka may be used in this way for stacking effects.

### Heroes

#### **1 Druzhina Captain**
60 gold crowns to hire.	
_The Druzhina are the ruling class of Kislev, and are afforded incentives such as tax relief and positions at Court in exchange for military service._

___
##### Special Rules	
**Leader:** Any warrior within 6" of the Bray Chief may use his Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.
**Inheritance:**  When the Kislevite warband is first created, the Druzhina Captain is allowed to purchase one item from the Kislevite Warrior equipment list at half the normal cost. This item represents a treasured family heirloom that has been passed down through the generations. Losing an ancestral item is considered very disrespectful and if the item is ever lost (e.g. from a Robbed result on the Serious Injury chart), the Captain MUST replace it with a finely-made substitute as quickly as possible or risk being haunted by the angry spirits of his ancestors. To replace an ancestral item, the Captain must purchase the same item of equipment at 150% of its normal price. This higher cost represents the fine detail and valuable materials used in the item’s manufacture. Until the item is replaced, the Captain suffers a -1 penalty to all tests and rolls to hit.

#### **0-1 Esaul**
40 gold crowns to hire.	
_Esaul is an ancient Cossack term that means ‘Best Warrior’, and was traditionally given to the most powerful fighter in the tribe. The word has survived the generations, and today it is an honorary title given by a chieftain to his personal champion._

Kislevites have a deep respect for these mighty beasts, and gather to see the trained specimens that accompany travelling circuses. The powerful men that train these bears are known simply as Bear Tamers, and the best of them are widely renowned amongst the people of Kislev. Bears can be trained for martial purposes as well, and Bear Tamers are often recruited into the armies of Kislev, where they enjoy a special status among the soldiery._

### Henchmen


#### Cossacks
25 gold crowns to hire	
_It is a testament to the bizarre nature of the Old World that of all the human nations only Kislev has managed to assign women the same rights as men. As a result their Cossack regiments tend to be very diverse, much to the bewilderment of their Empire neighbours._

**Weapons/Armour:** Cossacks may choose equipment from the Cossack Equipment List.


#### 0-5 Streltsi
30 gold crowns to hire	
_Streltsi are trained to use a small halberd called the berdiche. In fact the berdiche and handgun are the most widely recognised symbols of the Streltsi. In combat Streltsi are able to use their berdiches as rests for their handguns, increasing their accuracy and making for a deadly weapon combination._

##### Special Rules
**Gunrest:** If a Streltsi is equipped with a Halberd they gain +1 to hit when firing Handguns.



#### 0-1 Trained Bear
140 gold crowns to hire	
_Bear Tamers often bring one of their sacred bears with them when
they prepare to enter battle. These great beasts respect little, and it
takes years for a human to win their trust and obedience. The effort
to train one of these creatures is well worth it however, as one
cannot hope for a more loyal friend or useful ally when things turn
bad._

##### Special Rules	
**Fear:** As a large, slavering, roaring beast bears cause _fear_.	
**Large:** Bears are _Large_ sized.	
**Trained Bear:** The Bear may not use the warband leader's leadership. It instead uses the Bear Tamers, as long as they are within 6".	
**Enrage:** The Bear gains the _frenzy_ special rule if the Bear Tamer is ever _incapacitated_ or taken Out of Action.	
**Animal:** Bears are animals, and so do not gain experience.
