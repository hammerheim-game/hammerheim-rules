# Dwarf Adventurers
</div>

In many ways Dwarfs were the precursor race to humans. As the disperate human tribes were just beginning to unite under the idea of a single Empire, the Dwarfs were already a kingdom in decline. Vast tunnel networks that had interlinked their mountain Holds together had become infested with Greenskins and Skaven, and many Dwarfs lived long enough to see mankind evolve from a primitive people into a complex governmental alliance of nations.

The Dwarf people as a whole are sturdy and strong, brilliant craftsmen and excellent warriors, but above all they prize themselves on their loyalty to each other and to those they are indebted to. This strong bond of kinship has ensured that the Dwarfs are considered amongst the most united races in the face of the world.

It is this sense of kinship and honour combined with the shared ideals of the rule of law that has allowed them to form a deep relationship with their Empire neighbours. Conflict is scarce and usually brought about when small human guilds or settlements encroach into Dwarfen mountains, or mine too deep. Great alliances have been formed in mutual defence against the predations of Chaos too, for both humans and Dwarf alike have racial cousins against whom they have a bitter emnity.

They are known far and wide as the greatest miners and tunnelers in the world, the ageless halls of Karaz-a-Karak are but one gigantic example of how huge their works can become. As expected, the Dwarfs are highly proficient smiths and craftsmen, capable of producing works far more durable than the Elven metalworkers in far Ulthuan and hundreds of times more valuable than the trinkets of Men. Proud, honorable and resilient, it is said that the Dwarfs shall weather the horrors and misery of this world until its final bitter end.

### Dwarf Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Dwarf Adventurers warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origins of your Dwarf warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section.	
**Hatred:** Dwarfs _hate_ all Greenskins and Skaven.	
**Distrust:** Dwarfs have a deep distrust of elves, and may never form a Formal Alliance with any elven warband.	
**Relentless:** Dwarfs are never prevented from running due to enemies being within 8".

## Ranger Warband

When humans think of Dwarfs they typically think of Rangers, for they are the types most commonly encountered within the Empire. Among the Dwarfs however the Rangers are considered strange and unusual, treated even with a degree of mistrust and cynicism. Unlike their kin the Rangers are born for the outdoors and sleep under starlit skies, their lives spent in constant exploration as they challenge themselves to climb higher peaks and descover newer things.

In spite of this seemingly enlightened attitude to the world it would be a mistake to think that has mellowed their attitude, in fact Rangers are often the most dour of all their kin. Deeply ingrained in every Dwarf is a fierce sense of justice and loyalty, and as these Rangers see more and more of the often horrific sights of the Old World they become cold and bitter people. A human may live a whole lifetime under the scorn of a Ranger simply because their ancestors some hundred years ago was seen commiting a misdeed.

Many of the Dwarfs found living in human settlements in fact come from Ranger backgrounds, having realised the endless downward descent of hatred before they are consumed by it yet not able to return to subterrainian living.

##### Special Rules
**Scouts:** In addition to the normal skills you have access to, you also have access to the Infiltration skill on all your heroes upon gaining a skill advance. (see Skaven Special Skills)
**Ancestral Grudge:** After determining Formal Alliances but before rolling for first turn, roll a D6 and consult the following chart. This will determine the extent to which the Rangers are outraged at the slights of their opposing warbands, or simply the reminders of something they witnessed many years ago:

| D6 | Result |
| :- | :-: |
| 1-2 | Your leader hates the enemy leader. |
| 3-4 | Your heroes hate enemy heroes. |
| 5-6 | Your warband hates everyone. |	
	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral or Neutral.

## Slayer Warband

Becoming a Slayer is not so much a career choice as it is a means of atonement. If a Dwarf is disgraced, humiliated, or disowned by his clan, his only possible redemption is through a heroic death against overwhelming odds. Dwarfs who carry such a burden of shame join the ancient cult of Grimnir, the greatest hero of Dwarfkind. They cover their bodies with ritual tattoos including Grimnir's rune, dye their hair orange, spike it with animal fat, and become Slayers.

With the exception of one weapon and one chain mail coat (if they have one) all the Trollslayers' former possessions are either given to those he has wronged, or, if the circumstances of his disgrace do not involve a readily identifiable victim, they are distributed among his kin as if he had died unexpectedly. His name is stricken from the chronicles of his clan and guild, and he may no longer use his family name. Many Slayers adopt new names, to further distance themselves from their past.

Slayers leave their clan and hold, adding the pain of exile to the shame that marks them. They wander the mountains, and many gravitate towards centers of conflict and end up forming warbands as they congregate. These warbands journey like a solemn pilgrimage to the most dangerous corners of the Old World in the hope that they might atone for their actions with a worthy death.

With Mordheim utterly infested by the everchanging forces of Chaos there is a vast abundance of such unholy horrors there, and with the Shrine of Grimnir being conveniently just on Ostermark's border it has become a very tempting target for freshly oathed Slayers.


##### Special Rules
**Slayers:** Every Dwarf in the warband is _Immune to Psychology_ and may also take skills from Troll Slayer Special Skills in addition to their usual skill options. Additionally their profiles are changed accordingly:
> **Chief** is renamed to **Giant Slayer** and gains +1 Initiative.	
**Leftenant** is renamed to **Troll Slayer** and gains +1 Initiative.	
**Clansmen** are renamed to **Slayers** and gain +1 Initiative.

**Deathwish:** Dwarfs in the Slayer Warband may never wear armour of any kind, and may never use any missile weapon other than Throwing Axes.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.

## Miner Warband

It is perhaps not a surprise that, given the vast size of their sprawling empire before its collapse, Dwarfs are reknown for having the best miners in the Old World. They have an instinctive sense for stone and earth, and without investigation will often know exactly where ore deposits may be found or exactly what tunnels supports will be required in order to safely excavate. 

As a consequence they are extremely rarely seen by the other races. Miners spend much of their long lives beneath the Dwarven Holds, and with the Holds having been built over a millenia ago atop the richest deopsits there is very little reason for them to ever leave. This isolation breeds within Miners an acute sense of detatchment from the world, and while it doesn't quite border on contempt the Miners guilds have little concern for the lives of those above ground.

When rumours of a new type of stone being found in the devestated human city of Mordheim began to circulate it was not long before the Miners Guilds began to take notice. All matters of earth and stone are deemed theirs by birthright, and they do not consider anyone else's opinions on the matter as worthwhile. Bands of prospectors and Miners have therefore been sent into the Cursed City to investigate the phenomenon, and to determine the stones' potential value.





##### Special Rules
**Sappers:** After the terrain has been set up but before anyone has rolled for table edges, secretly note down a single building on the tabletop to have your Miners place Blasting Charges inside before the battle. This building may not be in any potential deployment zone, and it also may not be an objective building (such as the stash in Race to The Stash, or either alleyway building in Scrawling on The Wall). If your leader is within 2" of the building at the end of your turn, after the Combat Phase, and is not _incapacitated_ then he may detonate the charges. The building immediately suffers the Collapsing Building event from Random Happenings.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral.

#### Deathroller
250 gold crowns to hire.

_Deathrollers are an incredible leap in Dwarfen engineering, and represent a marked change in their production methods. Engineers are loathe to change, and consequentially the Dwarf war machines today are largely the same as they were some five hundred years ago. The Deathroller is unique not only for being an innovation, but also one distinctly out of character among the Dwarfs. Dwarfs typically eschew the use of mounts in favour of their own two feet, no matter how much slower, and yet the Deathroller has proven so fun to drive that some warbands have started adoping it. Even should it turn out to be wildly successful, given the stubborness of Hold Engineers it is likely we will not see Deathrollers produced on a large scale until the Empire has crumbled to dust. In the meantime however, the more forward-thinking Dwarfs have come to make excellent use of it for clearing a path._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Deathroller| 6 | 2 | - | 6 | 5 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 9 |
| Driver | - | 3 | 3 | 3 | - | - | 2 | 1 | 8 |	
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Deathroller is equipped with an enormous rotating drum at the front covered in horizontal 'teeth'. Unlike most chariots it does not have animals to pull it, as it is powered by its own drum. It has a single crewmember, The Driver, who is armed with a wrench. (Club).

##### Special Rules
**Chariot:** The Deathroller is a Chariot, and so functions as described <PLACEHOLDER PART OF BOOK<. It has a 4+ Armour Save due to its heavy plating.	
**Meat Grinder:** Few creatures can survive being caught under the giant drum at the front of the Deathroller. Its basic attack (but not its impact hits) have the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule.
