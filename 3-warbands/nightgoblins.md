# Night Goblins
</div>

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

Goblins are one of the most common and numerous pest-species in the Old World, with scattered tribes found on every continent save for Ulthuan. While all differ to some extent in customs and culture they share a great many similarities; they are cowardly and conniving, and lack the intelligence or wit to form complex towns or even structures. They subsist on a combination of hunting, minor raiding, and foraging, and only pose significant threat to anything more than lightly-armed travellers when absorbed into larger warbands or armies. There have been some exceptions of course, but this is generally understood to be the case. 

To the east of Ostermark however, dwelling within the abandoned tunnels below the Dwarf settlements of the World's Edge Mountains, is a cousin species that defies these assumptions. They are called the Night Goblins, and within the dank and overrun hallways of the once-great Dwarf Realms they have forged a vast empire of their own.

Night Goblins live in almost total darkness, the only light available being the dim glow of their red or amber eyes or the bioluminesence of the fungi which thrive in the tunnels so often fertilized by the remnants of battle. As a result they are extremely sensitive to light, and to protect their pale green skin they wear large and hooded robes. They are only seen above the surface on the rarest of occasions, and indeed their existence is so poorly documented that unlike the Skaven there is no need for the Empire to conduct elaborate cover-ups. Few beyond the Dwarf Holds have ever even heard of them.

There is good reason not to share this information with the wider world however, for the Dwarfs' percieved might is only maintained through ignorance on the part of the newer races of the daily struggles that every Hold must endure to prevent themselves from being overrun from below. The Night Goblins are tremendous innovators, breeding new strains of aggressive spherical beasts called Squigs, and constantly concocting new venoms and brews with which to better combat their foes. While most Goblin tribes barely advance beyond bronze arrowheads and clubs, the Night Goblins are able to manufacture serviceable steel weapons, even shaping them into ornate and cruel sickle shapes.

The Dwarf Holds represent the largest and wealthiest collections of resources available underground, and Night Goblins will frequently ally with Skaven clans in order to better attack a Hold and divide the loot. In practice however these alliances are little more than an exercise in determining which side will betray the other first, for Night Goblins are every bit as callous and selfish as the ratmen. Were an alliance between them ever to properly function there would certainly be no hope for the defending Hold.

Being an innovative species, the Night Goblins quickly descovered the properties of Wyrdstone as they found the fungi beneath Ostermark grow green and polluted. Previously 'safe' brews and soups would send Goblins into fatal comas, or to mutate beyond recognition. Experimentation began in earnest, but the Night Goblins could still only speculate as to the source of this bizarre green corruption. Initial prophecies blamed the Skaven, for the eerie green glow is most similar to that of their infernal Warpstone contraptions, but more astute and forward-thinking warlords were able to surmise that some event on the surface-world had been so impactful that it was even effecting the underways a mile below the surface.

While Night Goblins are most often encountered in vast hordes, the warlords of the World's Edge Mountains are well aware of the difficulties in moving about above the surface, and so have sent in clandestine agents under cover of darkness to investigate the source of the corruption - the human city of Mordheim. Here, with the city shrouded in a neverending night punctuated by the dim green Wyrdstone glow, the Night Goblins find themselves strangely well adapted.

The shadows keep them well hidden, and if they can but overcome their inherant agoraphobia and cowardice then their warlords will reward them most handsomely, for not only could the secrets of Wyrdstone enable the Night Goblins to defeat the hated Dwarfs, but it would deny the Skaven the technological advantage they have over them too.

### Special Rules
**Agoraphobia:** Having a sky above one's head is profoundly disturbing for a Night Goblin, and only those who have survived multiple excursions to the surface are capable of turning their gaze away from the ground without panic quickly setting in. If a model with the _Agoraphobia_ special rule is not inside or touching a building, and is neither in combat nor incapacitated, then they must take a Leadership test at the start of the Voluntary Moves part of their movement phase. If passed they may behave as normal.

If the warrior fails they must run (even if there are enemies within 8" - they will still run!) towards the nearest building, entering it if possible. They will then immediately attempt to go into Hiding, even though running would normally prevent them from doing so. It is incredible how sneaky a terrified Night Goblin can be when they truly believe they are about to die! Note that even if the model only travelled their normal movement distance this is still considered a running move (thus preventing most warriors from shooting). 
**Hates Dwarfs:** All Night Goblins hate Dwarfs.    
**Alignment:** Night Goblins are Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.

### Choice of Warriors

A Night Goblin warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 20. Your warband may not begin the campaign with more than five heroes. 
**Moonboss:** Each Night Goblin warband must have one Moonboss: no more no less!    .   
**Sneaky Gitz:** Your warband may include up to four Sneaky Gitz.   
**Shaman:** Your warband may include up to one Shaman.
**Cave Squigs:** Your warband may include one Cave Squig per hero. That's probably for the best.    
**Night Goblins:** Your warband may include any number of Night Goblins.

### Heroes

#### **1 Moonboss**
60 gold crowns to hire. 
_Only Goblins that have ventured out under many moons may earn the title of Moonboss - they are the most experienced Night Goblins when it comes to the surface world, and their guidance serves to soothe the superstitious minds of their underlings. They are calculating leaders and while not the deadliest of combatants have quickly learned to take advantages where they can, relying on stealth and surprise to overcome their foes._ 

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Moonboss may choose equipment from the Agent Equipment List.    
**Skills:** The Moonboss may choose from Combat, Academic, Shooting, Speed, and Assassin Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules 
**Leader:** Any allied warrior within 6" of the Moonboss may use their Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.  
**Inured:** Such is the exposure of this Goblin to mind-addling fungi that their total dependency on it is already a given, rather than something they develop. They never develop long term effects from Mandrake Root or Crimson Shade.




#### **0-4 Sneaky Gitz**
35 gold crowns to hire  
_As the name suggests, the Sneaky Gitz are the chosen companions to the Moonboss, or underlings depending on their relationship. The title is in fact an honourific, as Night Goblins all aspire to one day be deemed as so dastardly and clever that rivals can do little but sulk in begrudging respect._

**Weapons/Armour:** Sneaky Gitz may choose equipment from the Agent Equipment List.     
**Skills:** Sneaky Gitz may choose from Combat, Shooting, Academic, Speed, and Assassin Special Skills.

#### 0-1 Shaman
40 gold crowns to hire  
_Goblin Shamans are among the most insane (or self-sacrificing!) of all wizardkind, and occasionally capable of incredible feats of often accidental power. The Night Goblins have descovered a species of mushroom that vastly enhances their prowess at the cost of the consumer's sanity, making their Shamans among the deadliest (if shortest-lived). Shamans brought along on expeditions to Mordheim often bring their own supplies, though are made to promise not 'to do anyfing too weird'._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Shamans may choose equipment from the Gobbo Equipment List.     
**Skills:** Shamans may choose from Academic and Speed skills.

##### Special Rules

**Magic User:** Shamans use spells from Nasty Magicks.


### Henchmen


#### Night Goblins
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Discipline is all but non-existent among Goblinkind, and while that is certainly true of Night Goblins too their universal fear of discovery and light keeps them in check when travelling through enemy territory. Thus it is possible for a Moonboss to take a fairly sizable retinue of Goblins with him, and while he may pass it off as needing more hands to carry loot, it's more likely that he just feels safer hiding behind highly disposable underlings._

| | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Night Goblins may choose equipment from the Gobbo Equipment List.



#### Cave Squigs
65 Gold Crowns  
_Squigs are round, often red creatures the size of a large dog posessed of simple morphology and simpler minds: They are stomachs with short stumpy legs and vast gaping maws lined with gigantic fangs. They are legendarily foul-tempered and will gladly eat anything that moves, their incredible musculature and slavering violence making them a terrifying beast just as likely to turn on its master as it is to attack a foe._



##### Special Rules

**Fresh From Home!:** Cave Squigs may be bought for a Hero upon the Hero's recruitment, automatically granting them the Beast Companion skill. Night Goblin warbands do not need to roll for rarity when buying Cave Squigs, and only pay the base 65 Gold Crowns cost. Details for the Cave Squig may be found in the Attack Animals section.
