##### Marienburg

Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in
the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which alone
conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling
cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array
of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven
kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the
east. The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to
man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg
there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit.
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High Order
of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst
mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of
men feel themselves shackled by the old order and are eager
to seize power for themselves. Their champion for the
Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen
influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s
claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown
her that denied Marienburg the throne driving a wedge
between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and
armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish
and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has
earned them grudging respect. Their chief skills lie in
duelling and in the use of poisons and other clandestine
fighting methods. Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and
wear jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather coats,
bandanas and short swords that are easy to conceal.
Special rules

To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start off with
an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when fighting in a
campaign.
Furthermore the culture of duelling to settle disputes has
inculcated all Marienburgers with an extreme comfort with 
pistols and swords. Marienburg humans do not suffer the usual
penalty for using two weapons when using any combination of
Pistols, Duelling Pistols, or Swords. However they have also
learned not to fight fair! Marienburg warbands treat all items
from the Miscellaneous Equipment section as Common.

Alignment: Marienburg has an infamous reputation among the
Empire for their fluid and merchantile whims, their ethical 
flexibility unrivaled by their more hard-line 'us and them'
neighbours. As a result Marienburg may change their alignment during
any post-game phase, and may choose any alignment they wish.

##### Heroes

1 Mercenary Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
A Mercenary Captain is a tough professional warrior, a man who
will fight for anyone or against anything so long as the price is
right. Mordheim offers such a man the chance to become rich
beyond his dreams, though at great risk. But as ruthlessness and
lack of mercy and pity are the hallmarks of a successful Mercenary
Captain, it is no wonder that they flock to Mordheim.

0-3 Champions
35 gold crowns to hire
In any Mercenary warband there is one warrior who is bigger,
stronger (and often uglier) than his comrades. These men are called
Champions (or berserkers, first swordsmen and various other
names). Champions are amongst the toughest and the best fighters
in the warband. They often answer challenges issued to the warband
and, after the Captain, they get the pick of any equipment and loot.

deity in the midst of battle, but Clerics are capable of entire verses.

varying from the belligerent Warrior-Priests of Ulric to the mischevous
and magpie-like Priests of Ranald, to the devout healers of Shallaya.
