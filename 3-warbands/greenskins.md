The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of The Old World. The term "Greenskins" is a common collective description used by many civilized nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races. The broadest division is between the Orcs, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.

The Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilization. These tribal warriors are violent in their tendency, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known World. Time and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, and they take a boistrous and almost at times charming delight in it.

However, the Greenskins tendency for warfare has created a division within their society that has ensured their race shall never reach such heights. Since the dawn of their history, the Greenskins have been plagued by a never-ending series of strife and civil war that has consumed millions of their own kind, for such is their tendency for warfare that tribes have been known to fight each other just as much as they fight the other civilized races of the Old World.

Though such a disunion would often spell the doom of their race, such are the Greenskins' adept ability to both survive and thrive in the most harshest of environments, that the Greenskins can never truly be exterminated from the face of this earth. Without the proper knowledge or unity to progress past even the most basic foundations for a civilization, the Greenskins cannot amount to anything better than primitive savages living within scattered tribal societies.



### Greenskin Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Greenskins warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origins of your Greenskin warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section.	
**Animosity:** Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, and with their limited attention span bored warband members will often start squabbles among themselves! At the start of your Voluntary Movement phase (after charges have been resolved etc), warriors with the _Animosity_ special that are neither _incapacitated_ nor in combat must roll a D6 and consult the following chart:

> | D6 | Result |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | **“I ’Erd Dat!”** If the closest allied model to the warrior also has the _Animosity_ special rule, is unengaged, and is not _incapacitated_ then a fight breaks out! If within charge range the warrior will immediately charge into their ally and fight a single round of hand-to-hand combat. If the target is not within charge range the warrior will attempt to shoot them with their missile weapon. In either case neither model may take any voluntary action this turn as they trade insults. If the warrior cannot charge and has no ranged weapon, or if the closest ally does not have the _Animosity_ special rule, then they behave as if they had rolled a 2-5 on this table. |	
| 2~5 | **“Yoo Wot, Mate!?”** The warrior is fairly certain he heard an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin, but he’s not quite sure. That or an intervening Boss' ire is such that it keeps the warrior in check - they spend the turn sulking and grumbling and may take no voluntary action this turn. |	
| 6. | **“Waaaagh!”** Overcome by their pugnacious desires the Warrior surges forwards, irrespective of whether its a good idea or not! The Warrior must immediately declare a charge against an enemy within range, prioritising the foes that require the smallest amount of Initiative tests to attack. If there are no enemies within range they make a free additional move of up to their Movement value in any direction. They may then continue their turn as normal.

## Greenskin Mob

Greenskin Mobs are the most common type of warband, they are bands of misfits held together by the exceptional leadership of the biggest, nastiest Orcs around. Typically a mixture of Orcs and Goblins, these warbands come in the broadest array of of varieties imaginable - but their leader is always at its heart. Greenskins are induvidually a cowardly bunch, and any Big Boss knows full well that unless they themselves are constantly present their warband would quickly fall apart.

##### Special Rules
**Biggest Boss:** Greenskin Mob Bosses have the greatest imposition of leadership of any type of warband, and their leaders know it. Greenskin Mob warband leaders automatically get the _Battle Tongue_ skill upon recruitment. 
**Boyz in Charge:** Greenskin Mobs are typically a mixture of Orcs and Goblins, but no warband would ever allow _too_ many Goblins around as things tend to go missing around them. They may never have more than twice as many Goblins than there are Orcs.	
**'Uppity Little Gitz!:** While Orcs may occasionally take orders from Goblins if they have been thoroughly put in their place, no Orc would ever tolerate a Goblin leader. The leader of Greenskin Mobs must be an Orc.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.









## Goblin Pillagers

In the 'Biggest is Baddest' culture of Greenskins it is exceptionally difficult for Goblins to rise to prominence. As a result those that do tend to have to be incredibly conniving, and only the most ingenious of them will ever survive long enough to attract a following and start a warband. Those that do however find their ranks quickly swelling, as Goblins can almost always be found lurking somewhere no matter where.

##### Special Rules
**Goblins!:** The Big Boss of your warband becomes a Goblin! They now use equipment from the Goblin Equipment List, no longer may access Orc Special Skills, cost only 60 cold crowns, and their profile is  changed to the following:
> | Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 

**Little Waaagh:** Goblin Pillager Warbands may never include Orcs.	
**Numerous:** Your warband may include 2 Goblin Shamans rather than the usual 1, and may include 2 Trolls rather than the usual 1.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.


## Black Orc Warband

Smarter, stronger, more vicious and better equipped than the normal Orc (and that’s saying something when you’re talking about Orcs), Black Orcs are amongst some of the worst foes anyone can face in single combat...and a band of them is certainly something to put the fear into the hearts of men!

They do appear more built than born and it is little wonder that there are many rumours regarding their origins. Since the Storm of Chaos there are many, many more of these monsters now wandering the Empire, having followed the great Warboss Grimgor Ironhide. Where once the forces of the Empire could have tracked down warbands of these creatures in a matter of weeks, now there is no means or enough men to perform such a task and thus the Black Orcs roam freely. 

What aims do the Black Orcs have? What is the point of a tornado? It is meaningless to ponder such matters because all the Orcs want is to fight and that means attacking whomever crosses their path. What they gain from such battling is not completely understood, but it seems to be nothing more complicated than the chance to fight. There is no logic from them nor can any be expected.

##### Special Rules
**Quell Animosity:** Black Orcs are deeply unnerving to other Greenskins, as they don't seem to visibly enjoy the carnage they reap in any meaningful way - nor do they seem to take pleasure in a good ol' brawl with their mates. Greenskins within 4" of a Black Orc do not need to test for Animosity.	
**Black Orcs:** The Big Boss and the Bosses gain the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule and may additionally choose from Black Orc Special Skills upon gaining skill advances.	
**Serious:** Black Orc warbands do not believe in 'all dat magikk muck', nor are they capable of being in the presence of larger creatures without deeming them a challenge. Black Orc warbands may not have shamans or trolls.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Trolls have large claws and jaws with which to attack. They may never use weapons or armour, but suffer no penalties for doing so.

##### Special Rules
**Fear:** Trolls cause _Fear_.	
**Large:** Trolls are _Large_ sized.		
**Stupid:** Trolls are huge, often docile creatures unused to lives outside of their lair. They have the _Stupidity_ special rule, and may not gain experience. 	
**Regeneration (5+):** Trolls are rightly feared for their rapid healing powers, with stories of adventurers' swords becoming stuck within the Troll's body after a thrust as their wounds heal around the weapon. Trolls gain a 5+ Ward Save against any attack that is not _Flaming_.	
**The Right Stuff:** An unconventional strategy originally pioneered by Blood Bowl teams, Goblins have learned to use the brute size of their enormous allies to launch themselves into hard-to-reach places. In the shooting phase an unengaged Troll that did not run may attempt to throw a Goblin to any location within 8" and within line of sight. Scatter D6" to determine where the Goblin lands. The Goblin must then take Initiative tests as if it had just jumped down from a 4" ledge (needing therefore to take 2 Initiative tests, and if either or both are failed they suffer D3 S4 hits). If the landing location is on a lower elevation than the Troll then the difference in height is added to the 4".
