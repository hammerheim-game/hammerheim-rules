The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of The Old World. The term "Greenskins" is a common collective description used by many civilized nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races. The broadest division is between the Orcs, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.

The Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilization. These tribal warriors are violent in their tendency, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known World. Time and again, hordes of Greenskins will arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple carnage. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, and they take a boistrous and almost at times playful delight in it.

However, the Greenskins tendency for warfare has created such a division within their society that it has ensured their race shall never form civilizations. Since the dawn of their history, the Greenskins have been plagued by a never-ending series of strife and civil wars that have consumed millions of their own kind, for such is their tendency for warfare that tribes have been known to fight each other just as much as they fight the other more civilized races of the Old World.

Though such a disunion should spell the doom of their race, such is the Greenskins' adept ability to both survive and thrive in the harshest of environments, that the Greenskins can never truly be exterminated from the face of this earth. Typically groups of Greenskins will battle one another until a winner is established, after which the loser is either consumed or conglomorated into the larger and stronger tribe.

Over time these tribes will grow in strength, going from warbands to armies and eventually to vast green tides known as a WAAAAGH. When a Greenskin WAAAGH marches to war the ground itself trembles, for the Greenskins draw their power from those around them like a tyrannical hive mind. Their Shamans are able to draw upon this energy in a bizarre form of magic that no academic has managed to comprehend.

### Greenskin Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Greenskins warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origins of your Greenskin warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section. 
**Animosity:** Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, and with their limited attention span bored warband members will often start squabbles among themselves! At the start of your Voluntary Movement phase (after charges have been resolved etc), warriors with the _Animosity_ special rule that are neither _incapacitated_ nor in combat must roll a D6 and consult the following chart:

> | D6 | Result |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | **“I ’Erd Dat!”** If the closest allied model to the warrior also has the _Animosity_ special rule, is unengaged, and is not _incapacitated_ then a fight breaks out! If within charge range the warrior will immediately charge into their ally and fight a single round of hand-to-hand combat. If the target is not within charge range the warrior will attempt to shoot them with their missile weapon. In either case neither model may take any voluntary action this turn as they trade insults. If the warrior cannot charge and has no ranged weapon, or if the closest ally does not have the _Animosity_ special rule, then they behave as if they had rolled a 2-5 on this table. |  
| 2~5 | **“Yoo Wot, Mate!?”** The warrior is fairly certain he heard an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin, but he’s not quite sure. That or an intervening Boss's ire is such that it keeps the warrior in check - they spend the turn sulking and grumbling and may take no voluntary action this turn. |  
| 6. | **“Waaaagh!”** Overcome by their pugnacious desires the Warrior surges forwards, irrespective of whether it's a good idea or not! The Warrior must immediately declare a charge against an enemy within range, prioritising the foes that require the smallest amount of Initiative tests to attack. If there are no enemies within range they make a free additional move of up to their Movement value in any direction. They may then continue their turn as normal.

## Greenskin Mob

Greenskin Mobs are the most common type of warband. They are bands of misfits held together by the exceptional leadership of the biggest, nastiest Orcs around. Typically a mixture of Orcs and Goblins, these warbands come in the broadest array of of varieties imaginable - but their leader is always at its heart. Greenskins are induvidually a cowardly bunch, and any Big Boss knows full well that unless they themselves are constantly present their warband would quickly fall apart.

##### Special Rules
**Biggest Boss:** Greenskin Mob Bosses have the greatest imposition of leadership of any type of warband, and their leaders know it. Greenskin Mob warband leaders automatically get the _Battle Tongue_ skill upon recruitment. 
**Boyz in Charge:** Greenskin Mobs are typically a mixture of Orcs and Goblins, but no warband would ever allow _too_ many Goblins around as things tend to go missing around them. They may never have more than twice as many Goblins than there are Orcs.  
**'Uppity Little Gitz!:** While Orcs may occasionally take orders from Goblins if they have been thoroughly put in their place, no Orc would ever tolerate a Goblin leader. The leader of Greenskin Mobs must be an Orc.  
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.









## Goblin Pillagers

In the 'Biggest is Baddest' culture of Greenskins it is exceptionally difficult for Goblins to rise to prominence. As a result those that do tend to have to be incredibly conniving, and only the most ingenious of them will ever survive long enough to attract a following and start a warband. Those that do however find their ranks quickly swelling, as Goblins can almost always be found lurking somewhere no matter where.

##### Special Rules
**Goblins!:** The Big Boss of your warband is a Goblin! They now use equipment from the Goblin Equipment List, may no longer access Orc Special Skills, cost only 55 gold crowns, and their profile is  changed to the following:
> | Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 

**Little Waaagh:** Goblin Pillager Warbands may never include Orcs. 
**Numerous:** Your warband may include 2 Goblin Shamans rather than the usual 1, and may include 2 Trolls rather than the usual 1.  
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.

## Black Orc Warband

Within the World's Edge Mountains to the east of Ostermark lies the kingdom of the Chaos Dwarfs. There the chaotic offshoot of the Dwarfs reside within their volcanic holds, titans of industry that have built entire underground railways through the labours of the slaves they take from the far east. In an effort to create the perfect labourers they, through powerful sorceries, engineered a new breed of Orc that they hoped would be less rebellious and even stronger. The perfect beasts of burden.

The result are the Black Orcs, and there is nothing that unsettles a regular Orc more. They are just as violent as their kin, but seem to take no pleasure at all in the destruction they bring. They are brooding and psychotic, silent one moment and screaming with rage a heartbeat later. Occasionally groups of these Black Orcs will escape captivity and form warbands, though their motives are a mystery known (possibly not even) to themselves.

##### Special Rules
**Quell Animosity:** Black Orcs are deeply unnerving to other Greenskins, as they don't seem to visibly enjoy the carnage they reap in any meaningful way - nor do they seem to take pleasure in a good ol' brawl with their mates. Greenskins within 4" of a Black Orc do not need to test for Animosity.  
**Black Orcs:** The Big Boss and the Bosses become Black Orcs, gaining the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule and may treat their armour saves as 1 higher than normal.  
**Serious:** Black Orc warbands do not believe in 'all dat magikk muck', nor are they capable of being in the presence of larger creatures without deeming them a challenge. Black Orc warbands may not have shamans or trolls. 
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic or Chaotic.

**Weapons/Armour:** Trolls have large claws and jaws with which to attack. They may never use weapons or armour, but suffer no penalties for doing so.

##### Special Rules
**Fear:** Trolls cause _Fear_.  
**Large:** Trolls are _Large_ sized.    
**Stupid:** Trolls are huge, often docile creatures unused to lives outside of their lair. They have the _Stupidity_ special rule, and may not gain experience.   
**Regeneration (5+):** Trolls are rightly feared for their rapid healing powers, with stories of adventurers' swords becoming stuck within the Troll's body after a thrust as their wounds heal around the weapon. Trolls gain a 5+ Ward Save against any attack that is not _Flaming_. 
**The Right Stuff:** An unconventional strategy originally pioneered by Blood Bowl teams, Goblins have learned to use the brute size of their enormous allies to launch themselves into hard-to-reach places. In the shooting phase an unengaged Troll that did not run may attempt to throw a Goblin in base contact to any location within 8" and within line of sight. Scatter D6" to determine where the Goblin lands. The Goblin must then take Initiative tests as if it had just jumped down from a 4" ledge (needing therefore to take 2 Initiative tests, and if either or both are failed they suffer D3 S4 hits). If the landing location is on a lower elevation than the Troll then the difference in height is added to the 4".
