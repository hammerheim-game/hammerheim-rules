# Halflings
</div>


Halflings are a small people hailing from a region of the Empire known as Grand County of the Mootland. The Moot as it is known by 'Big Folk' is a mostly peaceful land, but ever since its inception it has been a source of constant strife in the region of which it is a part. The area that became the Moot was granted by edict of a truly insane Count of Stirland to his Halfling Chef due to his love of the creature's cooking, and it contains the most fertile and arable land in what is otherwise a truly destitute province. Most of its inhabitants are peaceable personalities, preferring quiet routines of farming, baking and brewing over martial pursuits or military endeavours. Despite this pacific way of life Halflings are tougher than they appear, remarkably courageous and will often stand their ground to fight resolutely while larger creatures might flee.

It’s not easy being a Halfling outside of the Moot. They are considered treacherous and duplicitous, and in Stirland children are given piniatas shaped like Halflings for them to "retake the sweets the Halflings stole" - a practice which has in many instances continued into adulthood with living versions. In Marienburg, the city watch rarely responds to emergencies reported in the Halfling ghettos, and The Merchant Council neglect to maintain roads and sewers in the streets of Little Moot.

In the face of this, many Halflings spit in the collective soup of Men. Wherever there are Humans there are Halflings, yet opportunities remain scarce. Many Halflings are forced through lack of alternatives into lives of crime in a sadly self-fulfilling prophecy, though it is a life for which Halflings are uniquely well adapted. Small of stature (and not quite with the same sense of self-preservation as their Human counterparts) Halflings are excellent infiltrators, thieves, and pickpockets. This in turn has led to the emergence of several Halfling crime syndicates who look out for one another, and many a thug who thought Halflings an easy mark for robbery later found a Paymaster at their door accompanied by an especially large, especially hungry Ogre.

Mordheim is not far from The Moot, only a few day's travel to the Stirland border then across into Ostermark. For Halfling syndicates there are rarely such rich opportunities, and with a thriving black market throughout the Empire among its cults and rogue wizards the smuggling of Wyrdstone is a highly lucrative business.

### Special Rules
**Woodland Striders:** Halflings can move through any woodland terrain without penalty. 
**Shortshanks:** Halflings are too short to ride horses with any success. To represent this, Halflings riding draft horses, warhorses or anything larger than a mule or mountain goat, moves 2" less than normal.   
**Smooth Customers:** Widely tolerated by vendors though never entirely welcomed as customers, Halfling Heroes gain +2 when rolling to find Rare items that are not exclusively available to Halflings. 
**Not a Threat:** 
Halflings are the butt of jokes, and few people take them seriously. Halflings never prevent enemies within 8" from running, and never count as the closest enemy for the purposes of shooting (except in the case of another Halfling being targetted, in which case the closest Halfling would still have to be shot). An enemy on ground level with a Halfling 6" away from them and a Human 12" away would therefore have to target the Human with their shooting, as they percieve the Human as being a greater threat!    
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral, Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

### Choice of Warriors

A Halfling Rogues warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and equip your warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband is 20. Your starting warband may not include more than 5 Heroes.  
**Guild Master:** Each Halfling warband must have one Guild Master: no more no less!    
**Racketeer:** Your warband may include up to three Racketeers. 
**Chef:** Your warband may include up to one Chef.  
**Thieves:** Your warband may include up to three Thieves.  
**Scouts:** Your warband may include any number of Scouts.      
**Moot Ogres:** Your warband may include up to two Moot Ogres.

### Heroes

#### **1 Guild Master**
80 gold crowns to hire. 
_Respected civilian dignitaries hold positions of authority in guilds. Elected leaders of borough districts from noble families have their fingers in a lot pies, criminals in other words! Even more rotund than their pot-bellied kin, a Guild Master can always avoid getting their hands dirty by delegating unsalubrious tasks to any number of the gangsters they associate with on a regular basis._ 

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 8 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Guild Master may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Hero Equipment list.   
**Skills:** The Guild Master may choose from Shooting, Academic, Speed, and Halfling Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules 
**Leader:** Any allied warrior within 6" of The Guild Mastermay use their Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.



#### **0-1 Paymaster**
45 gold crowns to hire  
_Paymasters have the difficult job of dividing up shares, as well as reclaiming 'misplaced' items from their warband. They typically are more violent and stocky than most Halflings, needing in some cases to hold their own against Humans in a brawl._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 3| 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 8 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** A Paymaster may be equipped from the Heroes equipment list. 
**Skills:** The Paymaster may choose from Combat, Strength, Speed, and Halfling Special Skills.


#### **0-3 Racketeers**
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Racketeers are the Halflings in the alleyways, the ones who make the deals. Cunning and pecuniary, they are fully-fledged members of the guild and fiercely loyal to their Guild Master._ 

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Racketeers may be equipped from the Heroes equipment list.      
**Skills:** The Racketeers may choose from Shooting, Academic, Speed, and Halfling Special Skills.
```
```


#### 0-1 Chef
50 gold crowns to hire  
_No matter how remote, how dangerous, or how impractical it may be to do so, no Halfling warband worth its salt would ever consider an expedition without a Chef. Chefs are the most wild and varied part of any Halfling warband, from naive artisans conned into service to maddened butchers hell-bent on experimenting with exotic ingredients._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 8 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** A Chef may be equipped from the Heroes Equipment list.      
**Skills:** Chefs may choose from Shooting, Speed, and Halfling Special Skills.
##### Special Rules
**Hot Pot:** Before each battle the Chef knocks up a spicy pot of stew to fend off fatigue. Before rolling for first turn, roll a D3+1. That is how many portions of stew the Chef has prepared! Allied models that begin their Recovery Phase in base contact with the Chef may consume one portion of Stew to recover a wound lost earlier in the battle. _Incapacitated_ warriors may not eat stew.

### Henchmen



#### 0-3 Thieves
20 Gold Crowns  
_Thieves are career criminal Halflings through which many of Guilds' acquisitions come. The role of a Thief is to steal, then to sell to the Guild who then launder the goods for later resale. As a result many of these Thieves operate as independent agents rather than full-time members of the Guild, and while the threat of violent retribution (such as being boiled into stew!) usually keeps them loyal it is not unheard of for Guilds who get too comfortable around their Thieves to become targets themselves._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 7 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Thieves may be equipped from the Scouts equipment list.

##### Special Rules
**Thief!:** At the end of each battle before rolling for exploration roll a D6 for each Thief in your warband. Any Thief that rolls a 1 is immediately removed from your warband roster with any equipment they were carrying and treasure they were holding during the battle. They also take all of your unspent Wyrdstone shards, and the entirety of your treasury! If multiple Thieves roll 1's they are both removed and considered to have conducted the heist together. Stored items are not stolen.    
**Infiltrate:** Halfling Thieves can infiltrate. See the Assassin special skill of the same name.   
**Sticky-Fingered Filchers:** For each Thief that took part in the battle and did not subsequently die or betray the warband by fleeing with their stolen goods, the warband may add a shard of Wyrdstone to the treasury.

#### Scouts

20 Gold Crowns  
_Scouts are the general term used for the employees of the Guild initially sent into an area to learn as much as they can, then feed information back to their Guild Master. This could be about the existence of rival Guilds, guard patrol timetables, lucrative burglary opportunities, or the presence of potentially corrupt officials. In Mordheim these street-smart Halflings make for excellent henchmen, as comfortable on the rooftops as they are at street level._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Scouts may be equipped from the Scouts equipment list.

#### 0-2 Moot Ogres
150 Gold Crowns 
_It is only natural that Ogres, beings driven almost solely by hunger and with a culture revolving around the worship of their gut, would find incredible friends among the Halflings. They offer much-needed muscle in exchange for the best food they could ever dream of, and the Ogres of the Moot are typically among the most rotund and joyous of their otherwise spiteful and violent kind._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 6 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Moot Ogres may be equipped from the Ogre Equipment List.

##### Special Rules

**Fear:** Ogres are large, threatening creatures that cause Fear.   
**Large:** Ogres are huge, lumbering creatures and therefore make tempting targets for Archers. Any model may shoot at an Ogre, even if it is not the closest target.   
**Skills:** An Ogre who becomes a Hero as a result of The Lad’s Got Talent may choose from the Combat and Strength skills.  
**Slow Witted:** Although Ogres are capable of earning experience and bettering themselves they are not the smartest of creatures. Ogres only gain advances at half the rate of everyone else (i.e. they must accrue twice as much experience as normal to get an advance).     
**The Right Stuff:** An unconventional strategy originally pioneered by Blood Bowl teams, Halflings have learned to use the brute size of their enormous allies to launch themselves into hard-to-reach places. In the shooting phase an unengaged Ogre that did not run may attempt to throw a Halfling to any location within 8" and within line of sight. Scatter D6" to determine where the Halfling lands. The Halfling must then take Initiative tests as if it had just jumped down from a 4" ledge (needing therefore to take 2 Initiative tests, and if either or both are failed they suffer D3 S4 hits). If the landing location is on a lower elevation than the Ogre then the difference in height is added to the 4".

If the Halfling lands in base contact with an enemy they are considered to have made a Diving Charge.
