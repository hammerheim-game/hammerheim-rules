# Von Carsteins
</div>

Count Vlad von Carstein and his wife Isabella have ruled the province of Sylvania for as long as anyone can remember. Peasants whisper of some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their court. Indeed, Sylvania has the most dire reputation of all the provinces of the Empire.

Few agents sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania have ever returned from those dark forests, and then rarely with their sanity intact. In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a throne of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the ruler of Sylvania. He waits in shadows, having set himself apart from the politics and bickering of the Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he, and all the ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave.

Here he patiently waits, drinking the blood of maidens from golden goblets. For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength and mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day soon he will march from the forests of Sylvania at the head of an army of restless dead, their numbers bolstered by generations of corpses maintained by the magical power of Wyrdstone.

If the Count is successful, he will raise all the dead between the Worlds Edge Mountains and the borders of Stirland, and go to war against the divided rulers of the Empire. His plans laid out, Vlad sends his thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his bidding. During dark moonless nights, black coaches arrive at the gates of Mordheim carrying coffins.

Yet these coaches are not borne by skeletal steeds, or guarded beneath the watchful eyes of grizzly ghouls. It is in fact the free people of Sylvania who guard these dark and gothic coaches, fully aware of the undead nature of their Master. The previous Count of Sylvana was Otto The Mad, and under his rule the citizens of Sylvana had suffered greatly - allowing entire villages to fall to the predations of Greenskins, Skaven, and Necromancers.

Under the leadership of the Von Carsteins however the people of Sylvania have seen a marked improval in their quality of life. Their vampiric overlords demand far less of them by way of taxation, no longer do peasants have to endure haughty and overmighty nobles requisitioning their property in order to fashion his personal Halberdiers some new hats. Indeed many see the Von Carsteins as their rightful overlords for they are razor-witted, eternally beautiful and youthful, superhumanly strong, masters of beasts, and their command over the undead ensures that the good law abiding folk need never fear the night.

Even the predation of Vampires upon the populous has seen a marked decline since the reign of Vlad and Isabella began. No longer do ghoulish and feral Strigoi Vampires prey upon the hapless villagers. Indeed with so many seeking the gifts of eternal life there is no shortage donors willing to give blood to the political elite in hopes of one day recieving the Blood Kiss - the gift of Vampirism.

### Special Rules
**Habituation:** Vampires' human servants rapidly have to become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Masters, though are not so exposed yet to undeath that they are not horrified by the likes of Zombies. Humans in a Von Carstein warband are immune to Fear effects caused by Vampires.   
**Freshly Blooded:** The more powerful Von Carsteins do not trouble themselves with the collection of trinkets, and leave these responsibilities as a testing ground for the newer Counts to experiment with their newfound powers. These Von Carsteins are extremely vigorous and keen as a result of their Vampiric infancy, and so may re-roll any 'Dead' results they get on Serious Injury. If the second result is also 'Dead' then the Vampire is well and truly dead. The warband may continue to play, but must recruit a new Von Carstein as soon as possible.     
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral or Neutral/Chaotic.

#### **1 Von Carstein Vampire**
110 gold crowns to hire.    
_Charming and charismatic, the Von Carsteins are the natural masters of all around them. Wills buckle and bend beneath their purred-out words, and to gaze into their eyes overlong can render one insensate. Though calm and fluid in motion they are among the most dangerous creatutres in Mordheim, not only possessed of the strength and speed of all Vampires but also an array of shapeshifting spells with which to beguile and trick their foes._

```

#### **0-4 Champions**
35 gold crowns to hire  
_Champions of Sylvanian warbands have grown particularly accustomed to the eccentricities of their masters, and earn their station through dour secrecy and a firm knowledge of when to be silent. The extent to which their will is their own will vary wildly from Champion to Champion however, for the Von Carsteins do not tolerate dissent._

### Henchmen

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

#### Warriors   
25 gold crowns to hire  
_These dogs of war are grim, seasoned fighters, as beholden to their lord as any other Empire soldier in spite of the Von Carstein's undead nature._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Warriors may choose from the Warrior Equipment List.

#### 0-4 Marksmen   
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Few are the Empire regiments that go to battle without the comfort of ranged firepower behind them. While the Von Carstein themselves may have no need of such mundane tasks as covering/surpressing fire, it improves the morale of his servants no end to allow them to assist from a distance._

```


#### 0-5 Feral Wolves
20 gold crowns to hire  
_Once the slavering terrors of lone travellers and livestock, the matt-furred wolves of Sylvania are yet another reason its people have come to embrace the Von Carsteins. With but a glance a whole pack is brought under the sway of the Vampire's will, and serves them unswervingly._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 9 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Feral Wolves do not use weapons, though suffer no penalties for doing so.
##### Special Rules 

**Animals:** Feral Wolves are animals, and therefore do not gain experience.    
**Dominated:** The control that the Vampire exerts over these beasts is far stronger than the natural bond between warbeast and master - one that may not be broken by conventional means. Abilities that effect animals, such as the Beastmaster skill or any effect that causes _Fear_ in animals have no effect on Feral Wolves.


#### 0-3 Fell Bats
40 gold coins   
_Vampires view Fell Bats much as a Bretonnian Lord might his prized hunting falcons, feeding them sweetmeats and treating them with surprising affection. They are however vast beasts the size of a large dog even before accounting for wingspan, and use their dagger-like fangs to attack with a terrifying savagery._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 1 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 4 |

##### Special Rules 
**Flying:** Fell Bats are great winged beasts capable of flight. They may freely move up to 10" over any terrain or models, or may run/charge up to 20". If flight is prohibited for any reason then they must move as normal.  
**Animals:** Fell Bats are animals, and therefore do not gain experience.   
**Fear:** The piercing screeches and furious biting of this rabid monstrosity is a horrifying thing to be victim to. Fell Bats cause _fear_.
