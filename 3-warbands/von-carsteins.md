#### Von Carstein Warband

Count Vlad von Carstein and his wife Isabella have ruled the
province of Sylvania for as long as anyone can remember –
peasants whisper of some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile
them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their court. Indeed,
Sylvania has the most dire reputation of all the provinces of
the Empire. Few men sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania
have ever returned from those dark Sylvanian forests, and then
rarely with their sanity intact.
In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a throne
of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the ruler of Sylvania.
He waits in shadows, having set himself apart from the politics
and bickering of the Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he,
and all the ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave. Here he patiently
waits, drinking the blood of maidens from gold goblets.
For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength and
mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day soon he will
march from the forests of Sylvania at the head of an army of
restless dead. The pieces of magic stone that lie scattered
among the ruins of Mordheim can give the Count the power to
challenge the nobles of the Empire and enslave the men of the
Old World.
Wyrdstone holds enough captured magical energy to unleash a
great spell of doom to rival that of Nagash the Black. If the
Count is successful, he will raise all the dead between the
Worlds Edge Mountains and the borders of Stirland, and go to
war against the divided rulers of the Empire. His plans laid
out, Vlad sends his thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his
bidding.
During dark, moonless nights, black coaches arrive at the
gates of Mordheim carrying coffins. Ghouls scuttle from their
hiding places to greet them, and corpses are stirred by a
command which the living cannot hear. Following the
commands of the Vampire, they hunt for shards of wyrdstone.
The night belongs to the Undead, and in Mordheim it is
always night.

##### Special Rules

Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Master (or

etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.

following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Heroes

1 Vampire
110 gold crowns to hire
Vampires lead the Undead in their search for the magical stones
that will give their master the power to conquer the Empire.
Although but pale shadows when compared to the dread Vampire
Lords, the immortal servants of Vlad are still some of the most
powerful creatures who fight in Mordheim. Most of them serve the
undying count of Sylvania, but some have found the city to their
liking, and have become independent.

0-1 Necromancer
35 gold crowns to hire
Necromancers are evil wizards, studying the corrupt art of
Necromancy. Many of them are acolytes and servants of Vlad von
Carstein, and follow the agents of their master to the city of the
Damned. Others are recruited from amongst wizards and warlocks
who have come under the suspicion of the various agents of Sigmar
and have fled to Mordheim to avoid persecution.

0-3 Dregs
20 gold crowns to hire
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of the demise of
Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals, shunned
even by the other men and women who still live in the ruins and
catacombs of the city.
Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with
surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to
their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve
them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to buy
equipment, weapons and supplies from the settlements around
Mordheim which would often not welcome Necromancers or where
Vampires would fall under the suspicion of the Witch Hunters. They
can also do the bidding of their vampiric master during daylight,
when the Vampires must rest in their coffins.

0-1 Undead Troll
150 gold crowns to hire
The Undead Troll is a construct created by a necromancer using
both Dark magic and arcane science. The Necromancer then applies
his knowledge of science and magic to bring this creature to a state
of semi-life. This is a long and drawn out process, which involves a
fair amount of maintenance, so the Necromancer may only maintain
one Undead Troll at a time.

Ghouls
40 gold crowns to hire
Ghouls are the descendants of evil and insane men who ate the flesh
of the dead. When the lean and hungry times of famine come upon
the Old World, the most depraved and destitute took to feasting on
corpses to survive.
Driven by their unspeakable craving for the meat of their fellow
men, these creatures have given up their human life and dwell near
graveyards, crypts and tombs, digging up the rotting corpses of the
recently buried and consuming the cold flesh with their bare teeth
and claws.
The destruction of Mordheim attracted many Ghoul clans from the
north, and now they have taken up permanent residence in the
crypts and cemeteries of the ruined city.

Dire Wolves are slavering Undead hounds, the animated remains of
the giant wolves of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Their chilling howls
can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors or most
ruthless Dwarf mercenaries. They prowl the streets of Mordheim
like shadows, and many men have died with the cold jaws of a Dire
Wolf around their neck.
