# Dark Elf Corsairs
</div>

Dark Elf Corsairs are notorious reavers, having spent their entire lives pillaging distant lands. They are the lionized darlings of Naggarothi society, embodying as they do the drive to earn riches and glory. It is a hard, dangerous life in the raiding fleets, but a successful voyage can see a captain and crew return laden down with wealth beyond the dreams of most city-dwellers. It is not uncommon for a Corsair fleet to spend years ransacking foreign lands, returning home only when their holds are bursting with slaves and plunder.

The most feared Corsairs are the Black Ark Corsairs. Black Arks are terrifying monsters of the sea, entire towns built up aboard a floating platform and sailed like a great battleship from which smaller pirate actions can be made. Attempting to sink a Black Ark often requires a full naval campaign, and only the Corsairs that manage to survive the turbulent and chaotic lifestyle long enough to earn a personal reputation could ever hope to be stationed aboard one.

With lives spent battling on blood-soaked soaked gangplanks, atop the masts of ships, across the hulls of moored fishing boats, and in many cases swinging from ropes, the Corsairs find themselves perfectly adapted for the chaotic and unpredictable fighting conditions in Mordheim.

Corsairs eschew shields and metal armour, relying on cloaks fashioned from Sea Dragon hide to preserve them from injury. Extremely lightweight, these hides are famed throughout their homeland for their resistance to arrows and are keenly sought after. No Black Ark captain to date has managed to acquire a mating pair of Sea Dragons to begin producing these hides on a larger scale, but it is assured that if ever one manages it they will become unimaginably wealthy.

They also carry a vile array of nets, grapples and barbed chains. Such tools are not only useful for getting a grip on the slippery flank of a ship, but also for ensnaring fleeing victims, who are soon thereafter dragged to a terrible fate.

### Henchmen


#### Corsairs
35 gold crowns to hire

#### 0-5 Shades
35 Gold Crowns	
_Shades are the scouts of a Dark Elf warband, usually independent rangers who far prefer quiet isolation and the satisfaction of a clean kill from afar than frantic melee. Their role is to scout settlements to inform the Corsairs of the most opportune times and places to strike. During conflicts the Shades defend the ship, and operate the infamous Repeater Bolt Throwers to strike land targets from extreme range._
