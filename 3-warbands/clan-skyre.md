#### Clan Skryre

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander and the Skryre Warband by Chris Haak
After the Eshin Clan had their coffers bolstered by the
warpstone collected from Mordheim clan Skryre became
suspicious. Ikit Klaw sent out his spies and found that
Mordheim offered a source of warpstone far easier to acquire
than mining. It would also be a great testing ground for their
new weapons of destruction.
The warped genius of the Skaven engineers is concentrated in
the work of Clan Skryre. They are the most technologically
advanced, using warpstone technology to create formidable
combat teams able to survive the City of Evil, and return with
hoards of warpstone for their warlock engineers.
Jezzail rifles, poisoned wind globes, and Warpfire throwers
are all the creations of Clan Skryre, the engineers. These
skaven are more intelligent than most, and design the war
machines used by skaven in massed warfare. When turned
upon the streets of Mordheim, the effects of these weapons
can be devastating.
Clan Skryre Warbands have great technological knowledge
and prefer Magic and Technology to combat.

Giant rats
15 gold crowns to buy

0-1 Clan Skryre Rat Ogre
300 gold crowns to hire

fiendish inventions which utilize a blend of foul magic and arcane
machinery. The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is the pinnacle of their
devilish engineering, utilizing the corpse of a Rat Ogre combined
with a mechanical exoskeleton and powered by refined wyrdstone.
Clan Skryre has sent out the handful that it has made to further test
them in combat. In battle it is a terrifying if somewhat unreliable
beast.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
4 3 3 5 5 3 1 3 10
Weapons/Armour: Jaws, claws, and a miniature Warpfire
thrower on its mechanical left arm.
Special Rules
Bio Machinery: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not alive as
such, being a monstrous combination of dead flesh, arcane
Skaven technology and dark sorcery. The Clan Skryre Rat
Ogre is immune to psychology and never leaves combat.
Experience: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres never gains
experiences.
Fear: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a fearsome, monstrous
beast that causes fear.
Immune to Poison: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not affected
by any poisons.
Large: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge creature that
towers above the heads of its fellow Skaven and men alike.
Any warrior may shoot at a Rat Ogre, even if it is not the
closet target.
May Not Run: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge
lumbering monster-machine that lacks the sheer animal speed
of a living Rat Ogre. It may not run but may charge.
Metallic Body: These give Clan Skryre Rat Ogre a 4+
armour save.
Unreliable: The technology of biomechanics is still pretty
much in its infancy and as with most Clan Skryre
experiments is neither safe nor entirely reliable! At the
beginning of each turn, the Skaven player should roll a D6 to

activate and work the Rat Ogre. On a roll of 2-6 everything is
fine and the Rat Ogre may be moved normally. On the roll of
a 1, something has gone drastically wrong — roll again on
the Malfunction table.
Upkeep: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres is always in need of
repair after battle and so the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres has an
upkeep of 35 GC, or the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres stops
working.
Malfunction table
D6 Result
1 Explodes: Something has gone horribly wrong with
the Rat Ogre's warpstone generator and it has
overloaded, exploding in a bright green flash! All
models within 6” of the Rat Ogre receive a single
Strength 5 hit. The Rat Ogre is completely destroyed.
Do not roll for injuries after the game.
2 Goes Berserk! From now until the end of the game,
the Rat Ogre is out of control. At the start of each of
the Skaven player's turns, the Rat Ogre will move
randomly (use the Artillery Scatter dice from
Warhammer to determine the distance and direction
moved) — if there are any warriors within charge
range (of either side) it will charge them, otherwise it
will move full pace towards the nearest warrior.
3 Shuts Down: The warpstone generator fizzles out and
the Rat Ogre comes to a halt for the rest of the battle.
It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.
4 Temporary Loss of Control: The Rat Ogre moves in
a random direction and if it comes into contact with
any warriors (of either side) it attacks and counts as
charging. If it does not move into contact with any
warriors but there are warriors within range of its
Warpfire thrower, it will fire this at them instead.
5-6 Freezes: The Rat Ogre just freezes on the spot for this
turn. It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.
