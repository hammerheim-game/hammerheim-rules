# Clan Skryre
</div>


Clan Skryre was the first of the four great Skaven clans. It's specialty is the horrible combination of arcane sorcery with mad science and engineering to create some of the greatest and most diabolical warmachines to have ever graced the tunnels of the great Under-Empire. Its members, known as Warlock-Engineers are both inventors and magicians alike, whose expertise aids in the manufacturing of all kinds of devices and weaponry for the use of those willing to pay. Many of them are full-fledged wizards themselves, capable of manipulating the Winds of Magic to cast spells on their own, but their most potent of weapons lies in their use of their own deadly machinery.

From their Warpforge workshops underneath the great swampland capital of Skavenblight, these tinker-rats have produced a vast arsenal of terrifying weapons in their long and glorious history, driven forwards by streaks of mad genius and an utter contempt for safety. These weapons are often oversized and inefficient monstrosities of screeching irradiated metal capable of firing only a few times before becoming so warped by the overcharging of power that courses through them that they explode in their wielder's paws.

In those few moments where the Warpstone functions properly however, those weapons are known to be the deadliest in the Old World. Poisoned Wind Globes unleash noxious and suffocating fumes as they are shattered around formations pinned in place by expendable slaves, and Warpfire Throwers discharge superheated liquid jets to reduce armour to molten slag.

Engineers that venture to Mordheim usually do so less out of a desire to locate sources of Wyrdstone for sale (though this does sweeten the deal) but rather to provide an ideal testing ground for their latest creations. The chaotic conditions, the variety of hostile warbands, and the near limitless supply of ammunition found in the area's scattered Wyrdstone allow the mad geniuses to run rampant in the area. The only limit is their imagination, and untold riches await any Engineer who winds up creating the next big thing.

>#### Poisoned Wind Globes
**Range:** 8"; **Strength:** n/a	
**Special Rules:** Thrown Weapon, Poisoned Wind.	
___
**Thrown Weapon:** Poisoned Wind Globes are treated as Throwing Knives in all respects, including the Knife Fighter special skill.	
**Poisoned Wind:** The globes themselves are largely harmless, thin glass spheres that shatter on even the simplest impact - but the gas they release is toxic to all creatures. The Globes wound any target on a roll of a 4+, and ignore armour saves. They have no effect on targets that are _Immune to Poison_.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


>#### Jezzail Rifle
**Range:** 36"; **Strength:** 5	
**Special Rules:** Assistant, Move or Fire, Multiple Wounds (D3), Sniper, Armour Piercing.	
___
**Assistant:** The Jezzail only requires one Skaven to aim and fire in theory, but it is in practice enormously cumbersome. Models carrying Jezzails may not run, and are at -1 to hit with all shooting. This penalty can be ignored if an unengaged ally is in base contact with the warrior. 	



<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


>#### Warpfire Thrower
**Range:** Special ; **Strength:** 5	
**Special Rules:** Assistant, Move or Fire, Multiple Wounds (D3), Sniper, Flaming Attacks, Fire Thrower, Misfire.	
___
**Assistant:** The Warpfire Thrower only requires one Skaven to aim and fire in theory, but it is in practice enormously cumbersome. _Small_ warriors carrying Warpfire Throwers may not run, and are at -1 to hit with all shooting. This penalty can be ignored if an unengaged ally is in base contact with the warrior. 
**Fire Thrower:** To shoot the Warpfire thrower, place the flame template so that the narrow end is touching your Warrior, then roll the Artillery Dice. The Template is then moved straight forwards by that number in inches. All models under the template or moved over by it are hit.	
**Misfire:** If a Missfire is rolled place the large round template over the Warrior. All models under the template suffer a Strength 5 hit with Multiple Wounds (D3). The Warrior is then immediately taken _Out of Action_.

### Heroes

#### **1 Chief Engineer**
90 gold crowns to hire.	
_Chief Engineers are provably geniuses. While many Engineers create masterwork weapons by mere accident these runs of luck are quick to reveal themselves, usually in gruesome fashion. Chief Engineers truly understand the craft of Warpstone, and while not as physically gifted as other Clan leaders they compensate with augmetics that they graft to their bodies that they constantly tinker with._	

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Chief Engineer may choose equipment from the Engineer Equipment List.	
**Skills:** The Chief Engineer may choose from Combat, Shooting, Academic, Speed, and Clan Skryre Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules	
**Leader:** Any warrior within 6" of the Chief Engineer may use his Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.
**Magic User:** The Chief Engineer uses spells from Machine Curses.


#### **0-1 Warlock Engineer**
45 gold crowns to hire	
_Warlock Engineers are intelligent Skaven that have trained for years in the use of warpstone, and have gained a fantastic command of magic from their exposure. They have all the makings of a leader but have yet to claw a position of power among the Chief Engineers._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Warlock Engineer may choose equipment from the Engineer Equipment List.	
**Skills:** Warlock Engineers may choose from Shooting, Academic, Speed, and Clan Skryre Special Skills.
##### Special Rules
**Magic User:** The Warlock Engineer uses spells from Machine Curses.

#### **0-2 Black Skaven**
40 gold crowns to hire	
_Black Skaven vary from Clan to Clan, though they always form the most elite inner circle that the leaders surround themselves with. In Skryre's case, Black Skaven are dedicated bodyguards - particularly to protect them against potential uprisings by Skavenslaves._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Black Skaven may choose equipment from the Engineer Equipment List.		
**Skills:** Black Skaven may choose from Combat, Strength, Speed, and Clan Skryre Special Skills.



#### 0-2 Apprentices
30 gold crowns to hire	
_Apprentices are nominally training under the guidance of the Chief Engineer, but more often they are made to carry the Engineer's most unstable and dangerous experiments. Only the Apprentices are expendable enough, but also loyal enough to be trusted with them._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Apprentices may choose equipment from the Machinist Equipment List.

### Henchmen


#### Skavenslaves
15 gold crowns to hire	
_Skavenslaves form the lowest of the low in Skaven society, their bodies worked to death and then consumed as food. They are kept in check by constant cruelty, and are deemed so expendable that many Engineers treat their own Slaves as ideal targets for weapons testing._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 5 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Such is the contempt for Skavenslaves by their leaders that you may never equip them with anything, though they suffer no penalty for fighting unarmed. They fight with teeth, claws, or whatever they can scrounge in the moment-to-moment of combat.

##### Special Rules:
**Expendable:** Skavenslaves are the exception to the usual rule that prevents you from shooting into a combat involving your own models. Randomize hits between your target and the Skavenslave as you normally would for shooting into a combat between two enemies.	
**Uprising!:** Should a Skavenslave henchman ever get the "Lad's Got Talent!" advance they gain enough courage that, in a moment of heroism befitting of their new rank as Hero, they enact brutal revenge on their captors! A Hero in your warband who had not been taken _Out of Action_ in the last game must make a serious injury roll. The Skavenslave who was promoted is then removed from the warband as their masters quickly and violently quash the uprising.

#### 0-1 Clan Skryre Rat Ogre
275 Gold Crowns	
_What sort of lunatic thought that taking a Rat Ogre, bolting a Warpstone-powered exoskeleton to it, and amputating one if its arms to replace with a Warpfire Thrower was a good idea?_

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 3 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 5 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is equipped with a Warpfire Thrower that may never be removed. It otherwise has no needs of weapons, fighting with its combination of oversized metallic jaws and claws.
##### Special Rules	
**Cyborg Monstrosity**: The Rat Ogre is more machine than living being. It may never gain experience, and causes _Fear_.	
**Exoskeleton**: The metallic plates that merge with the flesh on the Rat Ogre give it a 4+ Armour Save.	
**Weapons Platform:** The Rat Ogre is large enough to carry the Warpfire Thrower without the penalty to its movement, and may fire it while moving albeit barely. Clan Skryre Rat Ogres may never run, though can charge normally.	
**Large:** Rat Ogres are _Large_ sized.	
**Unreliable:** The technology of biomechanics is still in its infancy and as with most Clan Skryre experiments is neither safe nor entirely reliable! At the beginning of each turn, the Skaven player should roll a D6 to activate and work the Rat Ogre. On a roll of 2-6 everything is fine and the Rat Ogre may be moved normally. On the roll of a 1, something has gone drastically wrong — roll again on the Malfunction table.

| D6 | Malfunction ! |
| :- | :-: |
| 1 | Something has gone horribly wrong with the Rat Ogre's warpstone generator and it has overloaded, exploding in a bright green flash! All models within 6” of the Rat Ogre receive a single Strength 5 hit. The Rat Ogre is completely destroyed. Do not roll for injuries after the game. |
| 2 | From now until the end of the game the Rat Ogre goes berzerk! The Skaven player may no longer control it, and at the start of each of the Skaven player's turns the Rat Ogre will charge the nearest model (friend or foe!) and fight them in hand-to-hand. If no models are within charge range it will move 2D6" in a random direction. |
| 3 | The warpstone generator fizzles out and the Rat Ogre comes to a halt for the rest of the battle. It may no longer move or shoot, and its Weapon Skill is reduced to 0. |
| 4 | The Rat Ogre's joints completely lock up, preventing it from moving or shooting for this turn. |
| 5 | The Rat Ogre immediately discharges its Warpfire Thrower in a random direction, and may take no further action this turn. |
| 6 | Electricity surges through the Rat Ogre, inflicting D3 S5 hits. If it survives it gains the _Frenzy_ special rule and for the rest of the battle no longer has to roll on this table.
