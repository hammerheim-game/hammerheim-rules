#### Nuln Engineers

Based on Imperial Gunnery School of Nuln from the Nemesis Crown and Nuln Engineers By Josh Alexander
The Province of Nuln is renowned throughout the Empire as
a centre of commerce and knowledge, especially in the field
of engineering, the home to the finest handguns and war
machines, save for those constructed by the Dwarves. The
Imperial Gunnery School located there trains apprentices in
the intricacies of weapon design and maintenance, and is
crucial to the dominance of the armies of the Empire. The
relatively new science of black powder technology is
relentlessly researched and tested in Nuln, borrowing theories
from dwarf engineers and developing new ones through sheer
human ingenuity.
Nuln produces the majority of the cannons and other artillery
desired commodity used by the Empire army. In addition,
most of the handguns and pistols are manufactured in the city
as well. Its garrison is therefore unusually well armed, and
most enemies would rather mount an expedition into the
chaos wastes than an assault on Nuln.
Most of the students at the school come from the Imperial nobility,
sons who show talents in mathematics or an interest in things that
go boom, as well as not being immediately in line for succession.
Once they graduate, students are given the choice of staying in the
school for further studies (and eventually becoming a Master
Gunner) or returning home. For some the prospect of yet more
years of studies will send them home where they will go on to fight
as an army’s pistoleers or outriders, the others do attain their
pinnacle and get to watch their former trainees charge across the
battlefield, often to their deaths.
Hammerheim presents an irresistible opportunity to the aged
scholars of Nuln, as the mysterious wyrdstone is said to have
many useful properties. The few shards that have found their
way to Nuln have successfully been used in the creation of
more efficient black powder, as well as the basis of a new
alloy for gunmetal and cannonballs. However, the high cost
the shards accrue on the secondary market makes them a rare
and expensive commodity. Rather than entrust their interests
to the mercenary rabble that wander the lands of the Empire,
the Master Engineers of Nuln have sent out several Engineers
to fetch as many shards of wyrdstone as they can carry. In
their eyes, it is cheaper to simply replace a warband
slaughtered in the ruins than to pay the extra amount for the
scant wyrdstone that is available. These engineers gather
together some of their students and a few city guard and
depart, taking pains to bring along plenty of weapons and
ammunition. While less than pleased at their new occupation,
the engineers owe their very livelihood to the Master
Engineers of Nuln, and grudgingly comply with their edicts.
Engineer warbands are unusual, even for the eclectic rabble
that fights in the ruins. While they employ a few soldiers for
their practical knowledge, most of the groups consist of
academic, scholarly individuals. Many of these scientists
have served in the armies of the Empire and have military
training, rusty though it may be. Some leaders underestimate
the danger they present, for what they lack in ferocity and
strength they make up for with sheer firepower. It is usually
easy to determine if a Nuln warband is fighting nearby,
because the gunshots echo through the deserted ruins and can
be heard even from outside the city walls.

##### Special Rules

Impeccable Care: Amongst one of the first things that the
students are taught is to take proper care of their equipment
and the right way to perform that maintenance. Once they
have mastered this function, they learn to repair the same
weapons should they become damaged and because of this
they can buy such black powder weapons on the cheap and
quickly return them to good working order. As a result they
can buy these weapons at a fairly reduced price! They can
ALWAYS use the reduced cost for black powder weapons
listed in their starting Equipment List, and they gain an
additional +2 on rare rolls to find any black powder weapons
since people don’t mind selling broken guns!
Properly Used: The students know the proper way to use
their weapons, spending many hours on the school’s shooting
range. This is considered to be a good use of time between
lessons and recommended by all the school’s instructors,
after all if the students constantly blow themselves up with
their weapons, there wouldn’t be many graduates. When
using the optional Misfire rules, if a one is rolled, roll a
second dice. On a 3+ the misfire is ignored (the shot still
misses, but the weapon does NOT explode).
Proud To A Fault!: Anyone studying at the Imperial
Gunnery School is very proud of this fact, as it is a great
honour to be accepted. After they start using black powder
weapons, students recognise the superiority of these weapons
and refuse to bend their knee to the ‘lesser’ ranged weapons.
The members of this warband NEVER use any non-black
powder ranged weapons (this prohibition does NOT apply to
hired swords or dramatis personae, as they are hired help and
have not received proper Nuln training).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial
warband. The maximum number of models in your warband
may not exceed 15.

##### Heroes

1 Engineer
65 gold crowns to hire
Engineers oversee the training of apprentices and are always
exacting and precise. They epitomize the technological innovation of
Nuln, and their aim is usually as keen as their intellect. Instead of
dominating their warbands with fear or brute force, Engineers earn
respect through their experience and technical knowledge.

Engineer may use his Leadership instead of their own.
Precision: Engineers are trained to discern the most efficient
manner to achieve their goals. When shooting, they may
choose any target in range that they can see, rather than the
closest target.

0-1 Instructor
45 gold crowns to hire
The gunners of Nuln are the most respected in the Old World. They
are in charge of keeping up the mighty Empire war machines such
as the great cannons. They are well educated and extensively
trained, but not yet too battle-hardened, so these excursions give
them field experience, even in the smallest things.

weapons. While there is an Instructor in the warband all
Pistol weapons receive a +3” range bonus and all other black
powder weapons receive a +6” range bonus.


0-1 Senior Student
45 gold crowns to hire
The upperclassmen at the school are well acquainted with the forms
of combat and mechanics used by the Empire. The years of using
pistols and firing cannons has given them plenty of experience with
weaponry and this is not their first excursion into the wilds of the
Empire. It is likely to be their last before they graduate.

0-4 Underclassmen
20 gold crowns to hire
This is the first excursion for these freshmen, who have had maybe
only months of training and shooting. Most will see this as a chance
to escape the stuffy halls of academia and go hunting for pleasure.
The brighter ones will realise that this is a true test of their
dedication and knowledge.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Sons of the Gun
25 gold crowns to hire
Orphans left on the doorsteps of the school, well cared for and
trained to take care of the constructs as apprentices and assistants.
Many go on to form gun crews for the cannons taken into battle and
some even rise as far as commanding such crews. For the most part
they remain a background element to the successful workings of any
cannon or black powder weapon and have become an essential part
of the school. On the excursions, sons of the guns provide a much
needed set of arms to carry provisions and spare powder, as well as
providing much needed additional firepower in a fight.

list.

0-5 Guardsmen
35 gold crowns to hire
Guardsmen are the hired soldiers that form the police force of Nuln.
Most are simple farmhands hardened by military service, and earn a
living protecting the engineers. While not as adept at using firearms
as their allies, they provide much needed support in the close
quarter fighting of Hammerheim.

0-7 Riflemen
35 gold crowns to hire
Most Empire generals are glad to employ regiments of Nuln
Riflemen on the field of battle. These veteran troops are said to
never let their rifles out of arm’s reach, and are much feared due to
their legendary accuracy.

Special Rules
Rifle Training: Soldiers of Nuln are instructed in firearms
instead of swordplay, and are more skilled with rifles than
any other weapon. After a rifleman fires a black powder
weapon other than a blunderbuss, roll a die. On a 4+, the gun
is automatically reloaded and does not have to miss a turn
before being able to fire again.
