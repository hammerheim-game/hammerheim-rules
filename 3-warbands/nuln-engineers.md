# Dark Elf Corsairs

The Province of Nuln is renowned throughout the Empire as a centre of commerce and knowledge, especially in the field of engineering, the home to the finest prototype weapons and war machines, save for those constructed by the Dwarves.The Imperial Gunnery School located there trains apprentices in the intricacies of weapon design and maintenance, and is crucial to the dominance of the armies of the Empire.

The relatively new science of black powder technology is relentlessly researched and tested in Nuln, borrowing theories from dwarf engineers and developing new ones through sheer human ingenuity. Nuln produces the majority of the cannons and other artillery desired commodity used by the Empire army. In addition, most of the handguns and pistols are manufactured in the city as well. Its garrison is therefore unusually well armed, and most enemies would rather mount an expedition into the chaos wastes than an assault on Nuln.

Most of the students at the school come from the Imperial nobility, youths who show talents in mathematics or an interest in things that go boom, as well as not being immediately in line for succession. Once they graduate, students are given the choice of staying in the school for further studies (and eventually becoming a Master Gunner) or returning home. For some the prospect of yet more years of studies will send them home where they will go on to fight as an army’s pistoleers or outriders, the others do attain their pinnacle and get to watch their former trainees charge across the battlefield, often to their deaths.

Mordheim presents an irresistible opportunity to the aged scholars of Nuln, as the mysterious wyrdstone is said to have many useful properties. The few shards that have found their way to Nuln have successfully been used in the creation of more efficient black powder, as well as the basis of a new alloy for gunmetal and cannonballs. However, the high cost  the shards accrue on the secondary market makes them a rare and expensive commodity.

Rather than entrust their interests to the mercenary rabble that wander the lands of the Empire,  the Master Engineers of Nuln have sent out several Engineers to fetch as many shards of wyrdstone as they can carry. In  their eyes, it is cheaper to simply replace a warband slaughtered in the ruins than to pay the extra amount for the scant wyrdstone that is available. These engineers gather together some of their students and a few city guard and depart, taking pains to bring along plenty of weapons and ammunition. While less than pleased at their new occupation, the engineers owe their very livelihood to the Master Engineers of Nuln, and grudgingly comply with their edicts. 

Engineer warbands are unusual, even for the eclectic rabble that fights in the ruins. While they employ a few soldiers for their practical knowledge, most of the groups consist of academic, scholarly individuals. Many of these scientists have served in the armies of the Empire and have military training, rusty though it may be. Some leaders underestimate the danger they present, for what they lack in ferocity and strength they make up for with sheer firepower. It is usually easy to determine if a Nuln warband is fighting nearby, because the explosions echo through the deserted ruins and can be heard even from outside the city walls. 

### Special Rules
**Nuln Warehouses:** Due to the sheer quantity of Handguns and Pistols in Nuln they are able to requisition these items for substantially less than other warbands. See Equipment List for their own prices!	
**Proud to a Fault:** Anyone studying at the Imperial Gunnery School is very proud of this fact, as it is a great honour to be accepted. After they start using black powder weapons, students recognise the superiority of these weapons and refuse to bend their knee to the ‘lesser’ ranged weapons. The members of this warband NEVER use any non-black powder ranged weapons.	
**Care & Maintenance:** Any black powder weapon's misfire result may be ignored on a 4+, though the shot is still lost.			
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral, Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

### Heroes

#### **1 Engineer**
60 gold crowns to hire.	
_Engineers oversee the training of apprentices and are always
exacting and precise. They epitomize the technological innovation of
Nuln, and their aim is usually as keen as their intellect. Instead of
dominating their warbands with fear or brute force, Engineers earn
respect through their experience and technical knowledge.  _
