#### The Carnival of Chaos

No one knows from whence it came, the dreaded Carnival of
Chaos. Some have rumoured that it was once a gypsy caravan
from the east of the Empire, wandering folk that brought their
colourful fare from village to village entertaining the poor
rural folk of the Empire with their lavish shows and stage
plays. If this past is the truth then what it has become in the
present is far more sinister and deadly. Still it wanders the
rural backwaters of the Empire, in a colourful cavalcade of
wagons, its folk dressed in the colourful finery of travelling
players, bringing sonnet and song to excitable villagers and
peasants.
Upon reaching a new settlement, these outlandish showmen
erect their stage and entertain the poor rural folk with songs
and plays of the dark days of the Empire. Tales such as: ‘The
Emperor’s True Face’, ‘Orfeo and Pustulate’, ‘Papa Noigul’s
Festering Children’ and ‘A Midsummer Nightmare’ wow the
enraptured throng.
Strongmen perform feats of incredible prowess to the
adoration of the crowd, whilst players in garish, grinning
masks juggle balls, knives and flaming brands. As the
crowd’s numbers increase, a fool in bright jester’s garb with
an inflated pig’s bladder on a stick leaps from one enthralled
watcher to the next joking and cackling, poking and
prodding.
It is only when the show reaches its blasphemous climax, as
the sun begins to set, that the truth of the Carnival of Chaos is
revealed in all its putrid, festering glory. For these are no
mere wandering thespians and entertainers. When the players
perform their final act, known as the ‘Dance of Death’, the
enchantments covering their true visages slowly slip away
revealing them to their blissfully ignorant audience for they
are cavorting, cyclopean daemons with rotting flesh hanging
from yellowing bones. What were originally considered
intricately decorated masks and cleverly applied make-up is
soon revealed as the players’ true horribly mutated faces,
covered in pustules and pox-ridden lesions. As the villagers’
expressions turn from those of elation to abject terror at the
sight of these horrific visions the slaughter begins. By now
most of the folk who made up the cheering audience would
have already succumbed to the virulent diseases spread by
these malevolent players. The insidious Carnival Master,
accompanied by his cackling fool, rounds up those
unfortunate women and children that remain alive, taking a
finger from each of his new brides, exclaiming “You’re my
wife now!”. The survivors are then led away to an unknown
fate and the village is left deserted, its inhabitants and
livestock killed by innumerable diseases and plague.
The Carnival of Chaos is the sick joke of the Great Lord of
Decay, the Chaos god known as Nurgle. Thrice cursed
Nurgle is also known as the unspeakable Master of Plague

and Pestilence and the players in the Carnival are his corrupt
followers and worshippers. They are those who have sold
their souls for a twisted form of immortality through
embracing death, destruction and decay – learning to love
Nurgle’s many and varied gifts. It is not known how many
Carnivals of Chaos there are or if the handful of reports from
the lips of petrified witnesses all refer to the same warband.
The leader of the Carnival of Chaos is known as the Carnival
Master and is reputed to be a sorcerer of great power,
wielding the unclean magic of his lord to cause suffering and
death through disease and decay. Through dark ritual and
sacrifice, the Carnival Master summons forth the cackling,
decaying Daemons of his patron god to take part in the
twisted masquerade. His mortal followers carefully nurture
their newly acquired diseases, blessings of their gregarious
deity and vie for power and advancement under his watchful
gaze. The most blessed of these twisted, insane creatures are
those known as the Tainted Ones. These are often the right-
hand ‘men’ of the Carnival Master and their bodies are
wracked with a multitude of foul diseases and mutation. The
Carnival of Chaos is justly hunted by the many bands of
zealous Witch Hunters that traverse the lands but always
seems to be just one step ahead of the Sigmarites and
continues to follow its merry path, bringing the blessings of
Nurgle to all.

##### Heroes

1 Carnival Master
70 Gold Crowns to hire
These lead the diabolical Carnivals of Chaos. They are the chosen
of Nurgle and wield sorcerous powers gifted to them by their
pestilential god. The Master is a power-crazed individual that leads
his coven of Daemonic entertainers throughout the backwaters of
the Empire, tainting villages and settlements with disease. To the
backward peasantry of the Empire’s rural settlements, the Master
comes across as an exotic and charismatic showman bringing
outlandish entertainment into their otherwise dreary lives. It is the
Carnival Master’s cunning and clever enchantments that help to
keep his minions one step ahead of the patrols of the many Witch
Hunter bands that rove the land.

Weapons/Armor: The Master may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Carnival of Chaos
Equipment list.
Skills: The Carnival Master may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Academic, Strength, & Speed when he gains a new
skill.
Special Rules
Leader: Any models in the warband within 6" of the
Carnival Master may use his Leadership instead of their own.
Magic User: The Carnival Master has the ability to use
magic and casts spells like any other magicians, and the
Carnival Master starts with one spells generated at random
from the Nurgle Rituals. See the Magic section for details. In
addition the Magister may learn a new Spell instead on a new
skill.

0-2 Brutes
60 Gold Crowns to hire
These are a very specific type of mutant that have had their
constitution bolstered by the unnatural vitality of the Lord of Decay.
Nurgle’s foul attention has transformed what were once men into
massive, statuesque creatures rippling with diseased muscles and a
supernatural vigour. Brutes are immensely strong individuals and
their part in the masquerade that is the Carnival of Chaos is as
strongmen performing feats of strength to entertain the crowds.
They are nearly always hooded in the nature of executioners for
although their bodies appear outwardly strong and healthy, their
faces are often riddled with disease and are half-decayed. In battle,
they wield huge hammers and flails with reckless abandon, whirling
them around their heads like children’s toys.

Unnatural Strength: Brutes start the game with the
Strongman skill from the Strength skill list in the Mordheim
rulebook.


0-2 Tainted Ones
25 Gold Crowns to hire (+Cost of Blessings of Nurgle)
The Tainted Ones are those that are most blessed and favoured of
Father Nurgle. They hold a position of great importance within the
hierarchy of the Carnival. They are often heavily robed and
protected by powerful enchantments, for beneath their robes are
unspeakable horrors. The bodies of the Tainted Ones are so
wracked with disease and mutation that it is unsafe for even the
other mortal members of the warband to touch their bare skin.
Ironically, they take the most prestigious role in the Carnival – the
fool. The Tainted Ones leap and prance about the audience, dressed
as jesters, when the Carnival is performing, laughing and joking
with the gathered throng infecting them with their multitude of
horrendous maladies. These twisted creatures are exceptionally
dangerous opponents in combat too, for it is said that they carry the
dreaded and incurable Nurgle’s Rot.

Nurgle.
##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
0–2 Plague Bearers
50 Gold Crowns to hire
Plague Bearers are daemons of the Chaos god Nurgle, also known
as the Lord of Decay. They can be identified by their cyclopean
faces and horrifically decayed bodies. Their entrails hang from
tattered holes in their grey-green, poxridden flesh and the aura of
death and decay surrounds them. They are sometimes known as the
Tallymen of Plagues or Maggotkin and are highly revered by the
mortal members of the warband. As with all Daemons they can
never be killed or destroyed for good so long as the power of their
god prevails. However, their presence in the mortal world is tenuous
and can only be maintained for long periods by Dark Magic and
sacrifice. In the Carnival, the Plague Bearers revel in their showy
roles as stage actors and players, dressing in filth encrusted but
ostentatious doublet and hose.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 4 3 4 4 1 4 2 10
Weapons/Armor: None. Plague Bearers have huge filth
encrusted claws, which they use to tear and slash at their foes.
They therefore neither need nor use weapons and cannot wear
armor.
Special Rules
Cloud of Flies: Plague Bearers are surrounded by a cloud of
flies, which buzz around them and their combat opponent.
They do not affect the Plague Bearer but distract foes by
buzzing into eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Plague Bearer’s
close combat opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all
attacks.

Stream of Corruption: Plague Bearers can spew forth a
grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is
counted as a shooting attack with a range of 6" and is
resolved at Strength 3 with no saves for armor.
Demonic: Plague Bearers are Daemons of the lord of disease,
Nurgle, and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Plague Bearers are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Plague Bearers are Daemons and do
not know the concept of fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership-based test they are required to take.
Cause Fear: Plague Bearers are horrifying supernatural
creatures and therefore cause fear.
Daemonic Aura: Due to the magical, intangible nature of
Daemons they have a special Armor save of 5+. This is
modified by the Strength of the attack as normal and is
completely negated by magic weapons and spells. Plague
Bearers’ attacks are considered as magical also.
Daemonic Instability: Plague Bearers are bound to the
world by Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If
taken out of action a Plague Bearer is banished and
effectively destroyed on a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for
injury). In addition, if the warband routs then every Plague
Bearer in the warband must take an immediate Leadership
test. If this test is failed, then the Plague Bearer counts as
destroyed.


Nurglings
15 Gold Crowns to hire
Nurglings are tiny Daemons of Nurgle and are viewed by other
followers of the pus god as akin to his beloved children. They are
like rotten boils with legs and razor sharp teeth, that pick and tear
and infect their foes with filth-encrusted claws. Nurglings are
generally more of a nuisance in a fight than any real threat but in
sufficient numbers can overwhelm even the toughest of warriors.
Nurglings are mischievous little bundles of filth and pus and take
great delight in their part in the Carnival of Chaos, not only as
musicians but also as fools and slapstick comedians. Nurglings
often befriend the children of each village they visit, only revealing
their foul identity to their terrified victims at the final stage of
‘Nurgle’s Great Play’.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 3 0 3 2 1 3 1 10
Weapons/Armor: None. Nurglings do not use weapons or
wear armor.
Special Rules
Cloud of Flies: Nurglings are surrounded by a cloud of flies,
which buzz around them and their combat opponent. They do
not affect the Nurglings but distract foes by buzzing into
eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Nurgling’s close combat
opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all attacks.
Swarm: You may summon as many Nurglings as you wish
(i.e.. you may have more than five Nurglings in a Henchman
group).
Daemonic: Nurglings are Daemons of the diseased Lord
Nurgle and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Nurglings are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Nurglings are Daemons and do not
know the concept of fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership-based test they are required to take.
Daemonic Aura: Due to the magical, intangible nature of
Daemons they have a special Armor save of 5+. This is
modified by the Strength of the attack as normal and is
completely negated by magic weapons and spells. Nurglings’
attacks are also considered as magical.
Daemonic Instability: Nurglings are bound to the world by
Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If taken out
of action a Nurgling is banished and effectively destroyed on
a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for injury). In addition, if the
warband routs then every Nurgling in the warband must take
an immediate Leadership test. If this test is failed, then
Nurgling counts as destroyed.

Brethren
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Brethren are the crazed and devoted followers of Nurgle the Lord of
Decay. They have totally embraced the philosophy of the great Lord
of Decay and the path of damnation is the road that they have
chosen. Most brethren are infected with foul diseases and some have
even started to decay. Their faces are covered in warts and boils
and other lesser gifts of their lord. In the Carnival, the Brethren take
on all of the minor roles: stagehands, puppeteers, etc.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: Brethren may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Carnival of Chaos Equipment
list.
 
0–1 Plague Cart
250 Gold Crowns to hire
The Plague Cart is the embodiment of Nurgle and the core of the
Carnival of Chaos. Bedecked in the colourful, garish finery of the
coaches of travelling players and thespians, the Cart easily draws
the eyes of the dull and bland peasantry of the villages. However,
the canvas is tattered and rotten, the frame splintered and bent, the
metalwork pitted and rusted and the steeds rotted and dank. Few
mortals have ever seen the interior of one of these most sinister of
vehicles for it is only the Carnival Master and his Daemonic
minions that are permitted entry. It is rumoured that these
ramshackle wagons contain a pentagram daubed with dark runes of
incredible potency that actually creates a portal to the realms of
Chaos and the dwelling place of great Nurgle himself.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Cart - - - - 6 4 - - -
Horse 8 - - 3 3 1 3 1 -
Guardian - 3 - 3 3 - 3 1 -
Weapons/Armor: None. The Plague Cart’s Guardian is equipped with
a scythe, though it may not equip anything else. The Cart
is pulled by 2 horses and has a 5+ Armour Save.
Special Rules
Transport: Warband members on foot may ride inside the cart by 
moving into base contact with it - if they do so the cart may not move that
turn (or move any further if it already did). The Cart only has space inside 
for up to 4 wounds worth of passengers. Warriors may disembark from the Cart
at the end of each movement phase, though doing so takes up their entire 
movement. This move may be used to charge into combat with enemies already 
in contact with the cart, but that is all. Any occupants still 
inside the Cart if it is destroyed are placed in its stead and are Knocked Down.

Plague Cart: The cart's enclosed cabin provides excellent protection
to the passengers within, its wooden chassis reinforced with
unnaturally resilient twists of blubbery yet fibrous growth.
Warriors inside the cart may not be the target of shooting, spells, 
or attacks - though effects that damage all models in an area will 
effect all occupants. They also may not attack, shoot, or cast spells from
within it.

Ramshackle: Tall, wonky-wheeled, and distinctly box-like in shape these
wagons are designed for hauling stage props through the city rather than
for any type of speed or combat. The Plague Cart functions exactly like a
chariot, except it causes no Impact Hits.

Guardian: The Guardian comes as part of the Plague Cart. In
fact, more often than not he is physically bonded to the cart in
some twisted nightmare of flesh and wood. He may therefore
never dismount from the cart or leave under any
circumstances. The entire Cart rolls as one entity for injury rolls if it
is taken Out of Action, and it may never gain experience.
The Plague Cart and Guardian are considered Daemonic, and are 
Immune to Psychology.
