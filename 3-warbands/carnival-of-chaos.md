# Carnival of Chaos
</div>

No one knows from whence the dreaded Carnival of Chaos came. Some have rumoured that it was once a gypsy caravan from the east of the Empire, wandering folk that brought their colourful faire from village to village entertaining the poor rural folk of the Empire with their lavish shows and stage plays. If this past is the truth then what it has become in the present is far more sinister and deadly. Still it wanders the rural backwaters of the Empire, in a colourful cavalcade of wagons, its folk dressed in the vibrant finery of travelling players, bringing sonnet and song to excitable villagers and peasants.

Upon reaching a new settlement, these outlandish showmen erect their stage and entertain the poor rural folk with songs and plays of the dark days of the Empire. Tales such as: ‘The Emperor’s True Face’, ‘Orfeo and Pustulate’, ‘Papa Noigul’s Festering Children’ and ‘A Midsummer Nightmare’ wow the enraptured throng. Strongmen perform feats of incredible prowess to the adoration of the crowd, whilst players in garish, grinning masks juggle balls, knives and flaming brands. As the crowd’s numbers increase, a fool in bright jester’s garb with an inflated pig’s bladder on a stick leaps from one enthralled watcher to the next joking and cackling, poking and prodding.

It is only when the show reaches its blasphemous climax, as the sun begins to set, that the truth of the Carnival of Chaos is revealed in all its putrid, festering glory, for these are no mere wandering thespians and entertainers. When the players perform their final act, known as the ‘Dance of Death’, the enchantments covering their true visages slowly slip away revealing them to their blissfully ignorant audience as cyclopean daemons with rotting flesh hanging from yellowing bones. What were originally considered intricately decorated masks and cleverly applied make-up is soon revealed as the players’ true horribly mutated faces, covered in pustules and pox-ridden lesions.

As the villagers’ expressions turn from those of elation to abject terror at the sight of these horrific visions the slaughter begins. By now most of the folk who made up the cheering audience would have already succumbed to the virulent diseases spread by these malevolent players. The survivors are then led away to an unknown fate and the village is left deserted, its inhabitants and livestock killed by innumerable diseases and plague.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

The Carnival of Chaos is the sick joke of the Great Lord of Decay, the Chaos god known as Nurgle. Thrice cursed Nurgle is also known as the unspeakable Master of Plague and Pestilence and the players in the Carnival are his corrupt followers and worshippers. They are those who have sold their souls for a twisted form of immortality through embracing death, destruction and decay, learning to love Nurgle’s many and varied gifts. It is not known how many Carnivals of Chaos there are or if the handful of reports from the lips of petrified witnesses all refer to the same warband.

The leader of the Carnival of Chaos is known as the Carnival Master and is reputed to be a sorcerer of great power, wielding the unclean magic of their lord to cause suffering and death through disease and decay. Through dark ritual and sacrifice, the Carnival Master summons forth the cackling, decaying Daemons of their patron god to take part in the twisted masquerade. His mortal followers carefully nurture their newly acquired diseases, blessings of their gregarious deity and vie for power and advancement under his watchful gaze. 

The most blessed of these twisted, insane creatures are those known as the Tainted Ones. While most of the Carnival is (or was at some point) identifiably human, the Tainted Ones seem born directly from the Realm of Chaos, varying from shrivelled dessicated husks that exhume infectious spores, to great bloated monstrosities with slug-like bodies. The Carnival of Chaos is justly hunted by the many bands of zealous Witch Hunters that traverse the lands but always seems to be just one step ahead of the Sigmarites and continues to follow its merry path, bringing the blessings of Nurgle to all.

### Heroes

#### **1 Carnival Master**
70 gold crowns to hire. 
_Masters lead the diabolical Carnivals of Chaos. They are the chosen of Nurgle and wield sorcerous powers gifted to them by their pestilential god. The Master is a power-crazed individual that leads their coven of Daemonic entertainers throughout the backwaters of the Empire, tainting villages and settlements with disease. To the backward peasantry of the Empire’s rural settlements, the Master comes across as an exotic and charismatic performer bringing outlandish entertainment into their otherwise dreary lives. It is the Carnival Master’s cunning and clever enchantments that help to keep their minions one step ahead of the patrols of the many Witch Hunter bands that rove the land._

**Magic:** The Carnival Master uses spells from Nurgle Rituals.



#### **0-2 Strongmen**
60 gold crowns to hire. 
_These are a very specific type of mutant that have had their constitution bolstered by the unnatural vitality of the Lord of Decay. Nurgle’s foul attention has transformed what were once men into massive, statuesque creatures rippling with diseased muscles and a supernatural vigour. Brutes are immensely strong individuals and their part in the masquerade that is the Carnival of Chaos is performing feats of strength to entertain the crowds. They are nearly always hooded in the manner of executioners for although their bodies appear outwardly strong and healthy, their faces are often riddled with disease and are half-decayed. In battle, they wield huge hammers and flails with reckless abandon, whirling them around their heads like children’s toys._

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

#### 0-2 Tainted Ones
25 gold crowns to hire  
_The Tainted Ones are those that are the most blessed and favoured of Father Nurgle. They hold a position of great importance within the hierarchy of the Carnival. They are often heavily robed and protected by powerful enchantments, for beneath their robes are unspeakable horrors. The bodies of the Tainted Ones are so wracked with disease and mutation that it is unsafe for even the other mortal members of the warband to touch their bare skin. Ironically, they take the most prestigious role in the Carnival – the fool. The Tainted Ones leap and prance about the audience, dressed as jesters, when the Carnival is performing, laughing and joking with the gathered throng infecting them with their multitude of horrendous maladies._

### Henchmen


#### 0-2 Plague Bearers
50 gold crowns to hire  
_Plague Bearers are daemons of the Chaos god Nurgle, also known as the Lord of Decay. They can be identified by their cyclopean faces and horrificly decayed bodies. Their entrails hang from tattered holes in their grey-green, poxridden flesh and the aura of death and decay surrounds them._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 10 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** None. Plague Bearers use either gigantic filth-encrusted claws or heavy demonic blades. They may never use equipment, but suffer no penalty for doing so.

##### Special Rules
**Stream of Corruption:** Plague Bearers can spew forth a grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is counted as a Throwing Knife that does not allow armour saves.        
**Daemonic:** Plague Bearers are Daemons of the lord of disease, they are not made of living flesh but the eternal and magical force of Chaos. They never gain Experience. In addition they have a 5+ Ward Save against non-magical attacks.    
**Immune to Poison:** Plague Bearers are the literal embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally immune to all poison and diseases.  
**Unbreakable:** Plague Bearers have absolutely no concept of self-preservation 
**Fear:** As horrifying supernatural creatures Plague Bearers cause fear.   
**Daemonic Instability:** Plague Bearers are bound to the   world by Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. When rolling for injury Plague Bearers are removed from the warband on a 1-3 rather than a 1-2, and may never be the target of Medical Knowledge. In addition, if the warband routs then every Plague Bearer in the warband must take an immediate Leadership test. If this test is failed, then the Plague Bearer is immediately put _Out of Action._

#### Brethren 
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Brethren are the crazed and devoted followers of Nurgle. They have totally embraced the philosophy of the great Lord of Decay and the path of damnation is the road that they have chosen. Most brethren are infected with foul diseases and some have even started to decay. Their faces are covered in warts and boils and other lesser gifts of their lord. In the Carnival, the Brethren take on all of the minor roles: stagehands, puppeteers, etc._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Brethren may choose from the Carnie Equipment List.
\page
#### Plague Zombies
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Wherever the Carnival of Chaos goes, populations of Plague Zombies are sure to follow. Once the humble village-folk of the Empire, these peoples' minds have been severely decayed away by Nurgle's Rot. While still technically alive, alive enough at least to emit gargling moans through fluid-filled lungs, they are little more than servile automatons now - macabre puppets for the Master's plague-ridden pantomime._

| | 4 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 5 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Plague Zombies -may- choose weapons or armour, but suffer no penalties for not doing so.
##### Special Rules 
**Cause Fear:** Plague Zombies cause fear.  
**No Pain:** Plague Zombies treat a ‘stunned’ result on the Injury chart as ‘knocked down’. 
**Slow:** With leaden limbs and rotted joints, these poor souls lack the agility of life. They may never run, though they may charge normally.  


```
```
#### 0-1 Plague Cart
200 gold crowns to hire 
_The Plague Cart is the embodiment of Nurgle and the core of the Carnival of Chaos. Bedecked in the colourful, garish finery of the coaches of travelling players and thespians, the Cart easily draws the eyes of the dull and bland peasantry of the villages. However, the canvas is tattered and rotten, the frame splintered and bent, the metalwork pitted and rusted and the steeds rotted and dank. Few mortals have ever seen the interior of one of these most sinister of vehicles for it is only the Carnival Master and his Daemonic minions that are permitted entry. It is rumoured that these ramshackle wagons contain a pentagram daubed with dark runes of incredible potency that actually creates a portal to the realms of Chaos and the dwelling place of great Nurgle himself._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Cart| - | - | - | - | 5 | 4 | - | - | - |
| Horse | 8 | 3 | - | 3 | - | - | 3 | 1 | -
| Guardian | - | 3 | 0 | 3 | 3 | - | 3 | 1 | 8
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Guardian is equipped with a scythe, but may not choose any further equipment. The Cart is pulled by two horses.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

##### Special Rules 
**Transport**: Warband members on foot may ride inside the cart by 
moving into base contact with it - if they do so the cart may not move that
turn (or move any further if it already did). The Cart only has space inside 
for up to 4 wounds worth of passengers. Warriors may disembark from the Cart
at the end of each movement phase. Disembarking warriors are placed in base contact with the Cart. This move may be used to charge into combat with enemies already in contact with the cart. Any occupants still inside the Cart when it is destroyed immediately disembark and are _Knocked Down_.    
**Plague Cart:** The cart's enclosed cabin provides excellent protection to the passengers within, its wooden chassis reinforced with unnaturally resilient twists of blubbery yet fibrous growth. Warriors inside the cart may not be the target of shooting, spells, or attacks. They also may not attack, shoot, or cast spells from within it.  
**Ramshackle:** Tall, wonky-wheeled, and distinctly box-like in shape these wagons are designed for hauling stage props through the city rather than for any type of speed or combat. The Plague Cart functions exactly like a chariot, except it causes no Impact Hits.    
**Guardian:** The Guardian comes as part of the Plague Cart. In fact, more often than not it is physically bonded to the cart in some twisted nightmare of flesh and wood. It may therefore never dismount from the cart or leave under any circumstances. The entire Cart rolls as one entity for injury rolls if it is taken Out of Action.   
**Daemonic:** The Corpse Cart is an amalgamation of Daemonic entities, merged living flesh, and possessed woodwork. It never gains experience and has a 5+ Ward Save against non-magical attacks.
