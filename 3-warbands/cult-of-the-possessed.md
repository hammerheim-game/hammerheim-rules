# Cult of The Possessed
</div>


There is never any shortage of people willing to risk their lives for a chance of real power: those whose ambitions lie beyond the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or physical deformities place them in constant danger of persecution. What do such folk have to lose if they pledge their souls to the dark gods of Chaos? In the aftermath of the destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of the Witch Hunters. 

Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims lordship of the City of the Damned. He is called the Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do his bidding.

As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that proliferates in Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once human but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their appearances vary wildly depending on their patron gods. Corrupted from within, their flesh is twisted into whatever form their hosts deem most satisfactory. 



With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. The wild madness and rampant corruption that at times bends the vary fabric of reality only serves to strengthen the dark magicks that their sorcerers are capable of wielding, and the contaminated air does not affect them at all or, more likely, it only nourishes their potential. Those who venture into Mordheim alone are destined to be hunted down and sacrificed to the dark gods.

All warbands of the Possessed gather wyrdstone for the Shadowlord whose lair can be found at the very center of Mordheim at the impact site of the meteor, known as The Pit. His lair is a deep black cavern illuminated by smoldering green wyrdstone, and while his blessings are eagerly sought the Possessed cults know far better than to venture inside - instead leaving their gifts and offerings at the threshold.

While all Cults of The Possessed share a common goal their appearances and structures vary wildly - even between patrons of the same god. Rallied around powerful wizards called Magisters, the warbands are often reflections of the charm and character of their leaders, and their goals are inexorably tied to those of their masters. In some cases these Cults are even hired as mercenaries from shadowy induviduals within the Empire, often themselves covertly cultists, so the potential for variety is vast.

#### **0-2 Possessed**
90 gold crowns to hire	
_The Possessed have committed the greatest of heresies: they have given their bodies to Daemons. As a result, they are nightmarish creatures, a melding of flesh, metal and black magic. Inside them lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches of the Realm of Chaos. The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several creatures together, be they men or animals, into a multi-faceted horror. These monstrous Possessed are perhaps the most dangerous of the creatures of Mordheim, and certainly the most loathsome and dreadful._

_Darksouls those who have been driven insane by the daemonic possession which became all too common after the destruction of Mordheim. The Daemons have left the bodies of these people, but their minds have been scarred by the horror of the experience. Their insane strength makes Darksouls dangerous fighters. The Cultists regard them as holy, and let them work out their unreasoning rage in battle. In their tortured minds the Darksouls believe themselves to be Daemons. They wear leering daemonic masks and garb themselves in armour and clothing resembling the scaled skin of Daemons._

```
#### 0-1 Chaos Spawn
180 gold crowns to hire	
_Some cultists grow so fanatical in their pursut of mutation that these boons grow beyond their control, accellerating in rapid and violent growth that twists and contorts their bodies. Many deem these cultists as having achieved a form of ascension, for there is no creature as representative of the horrific power and inspiration of Chaos as the Spawn._

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

##### Special Rules
**Special Attacks:** Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.	
**Fear:** Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against nature and cause _fear_.	
**Special Movement:** The Spawn moves 2D6" per turn in the Compulsory Movement phase. It does not double its movement for charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat.	
**Unrelenting:** Chaos Spawns are impossible to deter, relentlessly attacking until they have reduced their targets to pulp or they themselves stop twitching. It is not unheard of for severed parts of a Chaos Spawn to wriggle about violently on the ground in an effort to attack everything around it for some time after the Spawn has died. The Chaos Spawn is _Unbreakable_ and is also _Immune to Psychology_.	
**No Brain:** Spawns of Chaos are crazed unthinking masses of chaotically writhing flesh and therefore gain no experience.	
**Large:** Spawns of Chaos are _Large_ sized.
