#### Cult of the Possessed

There is never any shortage of men willing to risk their lives
for a chance of real power: men whose ambitions lie beyond
the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or
physical deformities place them in constant danger of
persecution. What do such men have to lose if they pledge
their souls to the dark gods of Chaos! In the aftermath of the
destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have
appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the
stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical
gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of
the Witch Hunters.
Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims
lordship of the City of the Damned. He is called the
Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the
cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their
souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or
Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do
his bidding.
As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of
magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to
stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that proliferates in
Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all
natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once
men but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods
they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their
appearance is horrific – corrupted from within, their flesh is
twisted into a new and monstrous form.
With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers
of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. In the
Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of the Possessed ambushed
and destroyed a large force sent in to hunt them down. Now
the streets of Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his
servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at all or,
more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption. Men who
venture into Mordheim alone are hunted down and sacrificed
to the dark gods. All warbands of the Possessed gather
wyrdstone for the Shadowlord who remains hidden in the Pit
where he is said to be guarded by titanic Possessed the size of

houses. A few shards of the precious stone are kept by the
warbands and used to create more of the Possessed.
The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and each
leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark gods of Chaos.
These are men whose hunger for power knows no bounds,
who willingly give their bodies over to possession. All take
part in the blood sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of
Daemons – nothing is too base for them! These degenerate
humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they – things
half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors, and which men
refer to as Beastmen.
There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband. Deranged
warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave jagged weapons
and chant blasphemous rites as they throw themselves upon
their foes. Many are hardly recognisable as human, their
bodies are so scarred and disfigured. The stigmata of
mutation is borne by most, but the most unsettling of all are
the Possessed themselves – melded flesh made of men,
beasts, and metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon.

0-2 The Possessed
90 gold crowns to hire (+ the cost of mutations)
The Possessed have committed the greatest of heresies: they have
given their bodies to Daemons. As a result, they are nightmarish
creatures, a melding of flesh, metal and black magic. Inside them
lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches
of the Realm of Chaos.
The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several creatures
together, be they men or animals, into a multi-faceted horror. These
monstrous Possessed are perhaps the most dangerous of the
creatures of Mordheim, and certainly the most loathsome and
dreadful.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
0-5 Darksouls
35 gold crowns to hire
Darksouls are men who have been driven insane by the daemonic
possession which became all too common after the destruction of
Mordheim. The Daemons have left the bodies of these men, but their
minds have been scarred by the horror of the experience.
Their insane strength makes Darksouls dangerous fighters. The
Cultists regard them as holy men, and let them work out their
unreasoning rage in battle. In their tortured minds the Darksouls
believe themselves to be Daemons. They wear leering daemonic
masks and garb themselves in armor and clothing resembling the
scaled skin of Daemons.

Weapons/Armor: Darksouls may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Darksouls Equipment
list.
Special Rules
Crazed: Darksouls have been driven insane by daemonic
possession and know no fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership tests they are required to take.

Brethren
25 gold crowns to hire
Brethren are the crazed human followers of the cults of the dark
gods, eager to descend into damnation. Their vile deeds and
unspeakable acts have driven them to the brink of insanity.

0-3 Beastmen
45 gold crowns to hire
Beastmen are mutated monstrosities that infest the forests of the
Empire: massive horned creatures with an inhuman resistance to
pain. The destruction of Mordheim brought many Beastmen into the
ruined city to prey upon the survivors. They readily ally with the
Magisters of the Possessed warbands.
