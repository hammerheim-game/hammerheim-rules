# Beastmen Raiders
</div>


Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the awesome vitality of the Beastmen. Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other variations are also known to exist.

The Beastmen are divided into to two distinct breeds: Ungors, who are more numerous, twisted creatures that combine the worst qualities of man and beast, and Bestigors, a giant breed of Beastmen, a mix between some powerful animal and man. The Ungor are smaller Beastmen, who cannot compete with Bestigors in strength and power. They may have one horn or many, but these won’t be recognised as those of goat. Bray Shaman are very special Beastmen and are revered by all Beastmen, for they are the prophets and servants of Chaos Powers. Each warband of Beastmen includes a mix of some Bestigor, Gor warriors and Ungor who are the mainstay of the tribes.

Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak, Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others. The shards of the meteorite are seen as holy objects, which can be sold to the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors. For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then the Beastmen shall inherit.

Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the fur of their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck. While most Beastmen have dark brown skin and fur, black- furred or even albino Beastmen are not unknown. Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as armour as well as decoration. Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to create, but to destroy.

### Special Rules

**Infighting:** Beastmen are creatures of abhorrant temprament, and have more in common with Orcs than Humans when it comes to patience and discipline. At the start of your movement phase if there are any Gor or Ungor henchmen who did not charge an enemy but who are within charge range of an allied henchman they must take a Leadership test.

If the Gor or Ungor fails the test, he must attempt to charge one allied henchman within range (the player may choose which). The Gor or Ungor will then fight the allied henchman in the player's combat phase and, assuming they both survived, will move the combatants 1" apart at the end of their turn. A Gor or Ungor that kills an allied henchman in their way gains +1 experience. Heroes who gain infighting are so brash and arrogant that they will even target allied heroes. Warbands in Formal Alliances that are attacked by Beastmen in this way may break the alliance in their turn in reparation.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband is 15.
