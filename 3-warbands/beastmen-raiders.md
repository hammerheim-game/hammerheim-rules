# Beastmen Raiders
</div>


Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the awesome vitality of the Beastmen. Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other variations are also known to exist.

The origins of the Beastmen vary wildly - in some cases they are the twisted animals of the woods distorted into vast hulking forms through exposure to Chaotic corruption. In others they are the mutated offspring of humans who, unwilling to give up their offspring to sadistic Witch Hunters or euthanise them, are abandoned into the wilderness to fend for themselves. The unholy cross-breeding of the two is what has ultimately led to the Beastmen we see today, a truly feral humanoid race with a deep and burning resentment of mankind.    

Beastmen warbands follow a heirarchy as simple as it is brutal: the strongest lead. Challenges to leadership are frequent, and only the most grizzled and long-horned Beastmen are granted the first rights to often-unwilling breeding stock and feasting. They are a truly barbaric race, for while followers of the Chaos Gods often make bargains motivated by greed or desire the Beastmen feel no such things. They are driven solely by the urge to destroy and to defile, and flock to vast monoliths known as Herdstones to form uncontrolled rampaging armies.

___
Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak, Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others. The shards of Wyrdstone are seen as holy objects due to their mutagenic powers, meaning they can be exchanged with the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors. For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then the Beastmen shall inherit.

Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the hides of their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck. Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as armour as well as decoration. Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to create, but to destroy.

### Special Rules

**Infighting:** Beastmen are creatures of abhorrent temperament, and have more in common with Orcs than Humans when it comes to patience and discipline. During the Compulsory Movement portion of your Movement Phase if there are any unengaged Gor or Ungor henchmen who did not charge an enemy but who are within charge range of an allied henchman they must take a Leadership test.

If the Gor or Ungor fails the test, he must attempt to charge one allied henchman within range (the player may choose which). The Gor or Ungor will then fight the allied henchman in the player's combat phase and, assuming they both survive, will move the combatants 1" apart at the end of their turn. Henchmen that put other Henchmen _Out of Action_ in this way gain +1 experience. Heroes who engage in infighting are so brash and arrogant that they will even target allied heroes. Warbands in Formal Alliances that are attacked by Beastmen in this way may break the alliance in their turn in reparation.    
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic



### Choice of Warriors

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband is 15. A warband may not begin a campaign with more than five heroes.  
**Bray Chief:** Each Beastmen warband must have one Bray Chief – no more, no less!  
**Shaman:** Your warband may include up to one Shaman.  
**Bestigors:** Your warband may include up to four Bestigors.
