#### Beastmen Raiders

The Beastmen are brutish, wild and unnatural creatures that
live in the deep forests. Anyone travelling through this
untamed wilderness risks being attacked by these
unpredictable raiders. Many of those who dwell within the
forests around the outskirts of Mordheim claim that these vile
creatures of Chaos outnumber mankind, though such
statements are impossible to prove, for the Beastmen build no
cities and do not create any structured form of society as
such. Order and organisation are alien and hated by them, and
they roam where they will, pillaging and killing for whatever
they have need or want for. They willingly turn on each
other, picking on the weakest amongst them for food and fun.
The Beastmen naturally form into roaming warbands, though
whether they do so consciously or merely instinctively is
unknown. A small warband is able to move swiftly through
the wilderness unnoticed, and can cover hundreds of miles
each season as they travel where they will. They are led by
the strongest and most ferocious of their kind, and if ever one
within the warband senses a weakness in their leader, they
will turn on him in a brutish leadership challenge that can
only result in one of the two being killed and consumed by
the victor. Literally thousands of these small warbands infest
the dark forests of the Old World, preying upon travellers and
farmsteads.
A Beastmen warband attacks without warning, and villagers,
merchants and travellers live in constant fear of ambush from
these forest denizens. They try to prepare themselves for such
an event, and often desperately appeal to the nobles to scour
the forests with their State troops – however, at such a time of
political upheaval, the nobles have far more pressing
concerns than the pleas of low-born villagers. Forced to fend
for themselves, terrified villagers hack down great swathes of
the forest around their settlements, and sometimes hire the
services of mercenaries to protect them, barricading
themselves indoors when they hear rumours of a marauding
band within the area. Nevertheless, purges of the forest are
nearly always hopeless, for the Beastmen warbands generally
move far away from an area they have struck well before
organised retaliation can be mounted.
The more isolated farms and villages are most at risk
from attack, being far from any aid. Frequently, travellers
will discover buildings and farms burnt to the ground, cattle
butchered and lying where they were cut down. Full of
malevolence, Beastmen take particular delight in tearing
down the carefully constructed and ordered structures of men.
They smash down fences and rip buildings down to rubble,
allowing them to be reclaimed by the forests. They
maliciously soil and blight painstakingly planted crops, and
will tear the throats from newborn lambs merely for sport.
Beastmen warbands often form temporary encampments,
from which to raid the surrounding areas. These are crude
things, usually little more than a place to store any plundered
loot and food. They may include roughly staked out pens for
their massive war hounds or for holding captives – both are
taunted and starved for no other reason than it is in the
Beastmens nature to behave so. Typically, a warband will
remain at this encampment until it makes one sizeable raid,
whereupon the Beastman chief will move his camp to another
area. These encampments are often positioned nearby roads

and settlements, for such areas are ripe for plunder. The
Beastmen are a constant threat, and even if travellers are
lucky enough not to encounter them, their presence can
always be felt, watching and waiting in the twisted shadows
amongst the dark trees. None can predict their movements,
and many live in constant fear of their attacks.
Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and
Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and
are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging
power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which
makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting
regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are
comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the
awesome vitality of the Beastmen.
Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually
resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other
variations are also known to exist. The Beastmen are divided
into to two distinct breeds: Ungors, who are more numerous,
twisted creatures that combine the worst qualities of man and
beast, and Bestigors, a giant breed of Beastmen, a mix
between some powerful animal and man.
The Ungor are smaller Beastmen, who cannot compete with
Bestigors in strength and power. They may have one horn or
many, but these won’t be recognised as those of goat.
Bray Shaman are very special Beastmen and are revered by
all Beastmen, for they are the prophets and servants of Chaos
Powers.
Each warband of Beastmen includes a mix of some Bestigor,
Gor warriors and Ungor who are the mainstay of the tribes.
Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests
surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak,
Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others.
The shards of the meteorite are seen as holy objects, which
can be sold to the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans
in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors.
For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are
part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the
civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the
taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then
the Beastmen shall inherit.
Appearance: Beastmen Bestigor stand some six-seven feet
tall, and their heavily muscled bodies are covered with fur.
Ungor are lesser Beastmen, no larger than Humans, but their
tough bodies and vicious tempers easily make them a match
to any Human warrior.
Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the fur of
their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their
vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck.
While most Beastmen have dark brown skin and fur, black-
furred or even albino Beastmen are not unknown.
Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as
armor as well as decoration.
Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the
Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to
create, but to destroy.


##### Special Rules

Infighting: Beastmen are creatures of abhorrant temprament, and have 
more in common with Orcs than Humans when it comes to patience and 
discipline. At the start of your movement phase if there are any Gor 
or Ungor henchmen who did not charge an enemy but who are within charge range of
an allied henchman they must take a Leadership test. If the Gor or Ungor
fails the test, he must attempt to charge one allied henchman within range 
(the player may choose which). The Gor or Ungor will then fight the allied
henchman in the player's combat phase and, assuming they both survived, will
move the combatants 1" apart at the end of their turn. A Gor or Ungor that kills
an allied henchman in their way gains +1 experience. Heroes who gain infighting
are so brash and arrogant that they will even target allied heroes. Warbands in 
Formal Alliances that are attacked by Beastmen in this way may break the alliance 
in their turn in reparation.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

##### Choice of Warriors

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband is 15, though some buildings in the
warband’s encampment may increase this.

Chief: no more, no less!
