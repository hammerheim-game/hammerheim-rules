# Hochland
</div>

Hochland is a small and sparsely populated territory that is surrounded by the borders of Middenland, Nordland, Ostland, and Talabecland. As with most inland Empire countries Hochland is a densely forested place, though it is the most mountainous region too. It is a beautiful land with craggy snowcapped peaks overlooking the dense pines of Drakwald Forest, though the Hochlanders are all too aware of the dangers that lurk within. Hochland's forests are a prime breeding ground for Beastmen and Giants, their overgrowth ill suited to regimental fighting and as a consequence little has been done to stymie the outbreaks of raiding that come from it. This has caused friction with the hostile Talabeclanders to the south, though the Hochlanders have come to treat these incursions similarly to seasonal flooding. When a Beastman breyherd begins to form the Hochlanders retreat into the safety of the mountains while the Beastmen move on, Hochland settlements therefore usually being small and well hidden.

During these times of migration the Hochlanders live as hunters and watchers, their mountain vantages allowing them excellent views in all directions. This has also inculcated a scholarly culture within their people as they pass the time, with the highest literacy rate in all of the Empire. Researchers, engineers, and technicians find tranquil repose in the mountains of Hochland and this form of enlightened tourism has brought with it a surprising wealth. This wealth was greatly accellerated by the invention of the Hochland Long Rifle.

The bow's range was never really long enough for the mountains, and Beastmen will typically take several arrows to the torso before they fall. The Hochland Long Rifle solved both of these problems, being accurate enough at extreme ranges that an unseen Hochlander could safely pick off a scouting Beastman without the risk of it alerting their friends. Furthermore due to the vast open areas with flat cliff faces, the echoing booms make pinpointing the location of snipers impossible. These rifles became a national symbol, and long evenings spent tinkering with one's handgun has become an almost universal passtime among men and women as they strive to create the next personal revolution in firearms.

Whether it be due to the enlightened culture or the fact that simply seeing another human is a welcome relief from isolation the Hochlanders are known for their warmth and hospitality. While eccentric and protective of their guns they are a calm yet jovial people, and it is without a doubt the only place in the Empire where one could turn up at a stranger's door and be invited in for a stew without needing to fear for their lives. Hochland warbands are extremely rare, and are universally more interested in the study of wyrdstone and the researching of its effects rather than the pursuit of fortune and glory.

### Special Rules

**She's A Beaut:** Hochland Hunting Rifles are usually elaborate works of art, beautifully engraved and covered with gaudy studs to maximise the profit when inevitably sold to a saucer-eyed noble. These are considered by many Hochlanders to be tourist tat, and Hochlanders tend to own much more practical and well-used versions of the weapons. Characters with this special rule must own a Hochland Long Rifle or Handgun - if their weapon is lost and they cannot be bought another in the post-game phase they will immediately leave the warband to return home and start working on another. 
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral, or Neutral.

60 gold crowns to hire.

#### **0-1 Student Wizard**
35 gold crowns to hire  
_While Prayers are relatively safe methods of conjuring the powers of the divine, Magic is a much more volatile and dangerous affair. The ability to wield it however is never one of choice, and with the use of Magic at this time still punishable by death Wizards of aptitude must decide from a young age whether to live in secrecy or to live on the run, ever fearful of Witch Hunters. Be it through sympathy or a desire to study their incredible powers, some Hochland warbands will gladly accept these unfortunate souls._
