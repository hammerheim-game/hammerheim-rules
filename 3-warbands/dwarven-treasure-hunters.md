#### Dwarf Treasure Hunters

Dwarfs are a grim and exceptionally proud people. They respect three things above all else: age, wealth and skill. It is no
surprise then that these grim warriors can be found in Mordheim searching for fame and fortune. Mark Havener gives full
rules for including Dwarf warbands in Mordheim.
Occasionally, a Dwarf noble will find himself in desperate
times. His family hold may have been overrun by Goblins or
Skaven, or he may have somehow disgraced himself and
been banished. Other Dwarfs know these warriors as the
Dispossessed. Dwarfs are a proud race and it is against a
Dwarf ’s nature to lose himself in despair. Instead, a noble
who finds himself in such dire straits will gather together a
group of his closest friends and kin and go treasure hunting,
hoping to accumulate a large enough hoard to establish his
own holding. At this time, the largest source of wealth in the
Known World is rumoured to be a city in the Empire. The
city is known as Mordheim...

##### Special Rules

All Dwarfs are subject to the following special rules:
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Armor: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armor.
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for supremacy
in the Old World. A Dwarf warband may never include any
kind of Elven Hired Sword or Dramatis Personae.
Incomparable Miners: Dwarfs spend much of their lives
underground searching for precious minerals, and they are the
best in the world at this kind of work. In the city of
Mordheim they apply similar skills to the search for
wyrdstone. When checking for wyrdstone at the end of a
game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf
warband.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral

*Any weapon a Dwarf may normally purchase may be
bought as a Gromril weapon instead. This multiplies the cost
of the weapon by 3. For rules on Gromril weapons see the
Mordheim rulebook. Note that this price is only for a starting
warband, as it represents the Dwarfs outfitting themselves at
their own stronghold. Later purchases of Gromril weapons
are done using the price chart in the Mordheim rules.
**The price of a suit of Gromril armor is cheaper for a
starting warband to represent the relative ease with which
Dwarfs can find such items in their own stronghold. Later
purchases of Gromril armor must be done using the normal
price chart in the Mordheim rules.
##### Heroes

1 Dwarf Noble
85 gold crowns to hire
Dwarf Nobles are fortune seekers who have recruited a band of like-
minded Dwarfs and set off from their stronghold in search of riches.
A Dwarf Noble is well respected by the members of his warband.
Often he is a member of one of the noble families of the lost Dwarf
strongholds, dreaming of collecting enough treasure to restore the
former glory of the Dwarf Kingdoms.

psychopathic and violent. There are however few better fighters in
the Known World, so they are much sought after by Dwarf treasure
hunters.
