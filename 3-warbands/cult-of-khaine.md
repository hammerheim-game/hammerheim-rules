# Cult of Khaine
</div>

Typically we think of cults as being small clandestine organizations where religious zealots form closed communities to practice their worship of frowned-upon gods. At one point in the Elves' history, prior to the schism that seperated Dark Elves from High Elves, that was certainly true for the Cult of Khaine - a small group of Elves wholly devoted to the worship of Khaine, the Bloody-Handed God. As the Elven god of murder and treachery his cultists are extremely dangerous, and they revel in what they percieve as being the ultimate expression of freedom. This cult was small at the time, utterly overshadowed by the Cult of Pleasure that perhaps unsurprisingly had a much more attractive proposition. That changed when the great civil war occured - suddenly the services of the Khaine were much more attractively sought after, and the Cult's popularity grew.

Today the Cult of Khaine is the most pre-eminent organization within the Dark Elf homelands, and has an overwhelming presence in every major territory. It is through the Cult of Khaine that bloodthirsty Dark Elves may revel in their most sadistic needs, whether it be gladiatorial sports or the simple butchery of slaves, and the Priests and Priestesses of Khaine become experts at wordplay as they stir the crowds into a frenzy of violent anticipation. Almost every Dark Elf thus has some level of interraction with the Cult of Khaine for recreational purposes, and while there are plenty of roles within the Cult that manage the day-to-day upkeep of shrines etcetera the most aspirational go on to learn the arts of assassination and execution.

At the heart of the Cult are the Witch Elves. Witch Elves, known also as the Brides of Khaine, are the cruelest of all their heartless race, for they live only to serve Khaine's malevolent demands for bloody and agonising sacrifice. Their observances to the Lord of Murder are blood-slicked affairs. Still-beating hearts are ripped from victims' chests and hurled into fires, writhing flesh is daubed with gore-red runes and altars are decorated with the entrails of dying captives. Yet ceremonies are but a part of the Witch Elves' worship -- their truest observances take place upon the field of battle. 

On the eve of war Witch Elves drink blood laced with poisonous herbs, driving them into a divine frenzy. Whilst in this god-touched state, Witch Elves give no thought to their own defense, and seek only to hack foes apart in a blood-drenched orgy of slaughter. There is little grace to such an assault, merely a whirling storm of venom-coated blades that slash at the foe with maddened fury. Those enemies unfortunate enough to survive their wounds are rounded up by the Witch Elves at the battle's end. These poor souls are torn apart in wild victory celebrations, their blood offered in libation to the ever-thirsting Lord of Murder. This utterly wild and uncontrolled bloodlust is a danger even to their allies, who often fall victim after the battles to the predations of Witch Elves who refuse to let their high end just yet, to such an extent that most warband leaders outright refuse to recruit Witch Elves to their warbands in spite of their martial prowess.

### Heroes

#### **1 Witch Hag**
90 gold crowns to hire.	
_Witch Hags are the cult elders, though you would never know it to look at them. Secrets of endless youth and vigour gained by the ritual bathing in cauldrons of blood enable successful Witch Elves to sustain themselves indefinitely. While vicious in battle the Hags are surprisingly shrewd in the moments they surface above the murderous haze. _

#### **0-1 Sorceress**

_The Witch King, leader of the Dark Elves, is prophecised to die at the hands of a Sorcerer. Consequentially any males found to have magical abilities are killed during childhood, one of the few laws in Dark Elf society._

#### **0-3 Executioners**

\page
#### 0-1 Assassin
80 gold crowns to hire	
_Assassins are perhaps unsurprisingly in extremely high demand among Dark Elves, but it is also extremely difficult to ever surprise or ambush an Elf. Consequentially the skill required by these Assassins is enormous, and their efficacy at the arts of stealth, escape, and murder is unmatched._

### Henchmen


#### Witch Elves
35 gold crowns to hire	
_It is perhaps unsurprising that the Cult of Khaine has many friends in Norsca. While the two factions frequently come to blows they both hold a degree of respect for the berzerker and raider culture of the other, though the Witch Elves are unarguably the wilder._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Witch Elves may choose equipment from the Khaine Equipment List.

##### Special Rules:
**Frenzy:** Witch Elves have the _Frenzy_ special rule.

#### 0-5 Shades
35 Gold Crowns	
_Shades are the scouts of a Dark Elf warband, usually independent rangers who far prefer quiet isolation and the satisfaction of a clean kill from afar than frantic melee. Many Assassins began their careers as Shades, and while Shades are not a part of the Cult themselves they do serve a highly important role within the warband. Witch Elves under the effects of their toxins are impossible to control, and so the role of Shades is to wait for the effects of the drugs to expire, and then assist in guiding the exhausted Witch Elves home._
