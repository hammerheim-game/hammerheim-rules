#### Battle Monks of Cathay

The borders of Grand Cathay present a myriad of obstacles to invaders from the known world. In its north the verdant rice fields are defended by the Great Bastion, a walled fortress which stretches further than the eye can see. The west is shielded by a haunted mountainous stretch, remembered as the Ancient Giant Holds, and the contaminated sands of the Baleful Deserts in the north-west where wyrdstone is said to be found. Upon the slopes towering monasteries were built long ago by monks living in the outskirts of Cathay. In relative solitude these cowled guardians split their time between meditating, fishing, and crafting, all the while honing extraordinary fighting techniques. The brother’s dedication at arms, not to mention acrobatic defensive strikes, has repelled despoilers from the sacred grounds of each fortified tabernacle.

Innkeepers, swordsmiths, merchants, fishermen, and farmers have all survived in the monk’s proximity, seeking the protection afforded by the monasteries surrounds in these perilous borderlands. Peasant folk risk what little they have by taking shelter here in the wilderness. Tranquillity found within the temple sanctums is a far cry from the warmongering tribes who threaten the Cathayan Empire. From the west loom feral bands of Ogres and men with no honour. Hobgoblin riders roam the steppes to the north-west.  From the Wastes to the north come the marauding hordes of Chaos barbarians and creatures of horror that feast upon flesh.

In times of strife frontiers are defended by the community. Local militia comprises of the strongest young men, supporting trained soldiers of the Emperor’s Guard. An authorised emissary from Weijin is appointed by Imperial decree to govern each border district. The military view warrior monks as hooded vigilantes, and a menace to law and order. Temple masters themselves only cooperate with the emissary for that is the Emperor’s bidding. So it is that they are united in battle against the enemies of the throne. Officers begrudge the monks meddling in their affairs, yet heroic deeds and the martial arts mastery of these robed advocates is ultimately what keeps raiding parties of hobgoblins, beastmen, marauders and mutants out. The combat skills of a Celestial Dragon Monk surpass anything that Old World scholars have seen – even when using no weapons at all!

### Special rules

Strictures: A stringent regime of meditation is used by monks. Their faith is supported by a notion that the skin of ones body is armour in itself. Dragon Monks and Warrior Monks never wear any kind of armour.

Distaste for Poison: The use of poisons and various drugs is a speciality for dishonourable warriors who would stoop to such ends. Dragon Monks and Warrior Monks frown on this and may never use any kind of poison or venom.

Outsiders: Foreigners are generally considered unwelcome by the border guards of Cathay. The Battle Monks warband is Distrustful of all non-Cathayan warbands.

### Special Equipment

As you may have noticed many of the items available to the Battle Monks warband have never been seen in Mordheim before. These items are so bizarre and require such a lifetime of practice that even should they fall into enemy hands, not even a Hero with Weapons Training will be able to wield them. Any weapon below that says "Battle Monks" only may only ever be wielded by a Dragon Monk or Warrior Monk.


#### Quarterstaff
_Range_: Close Combat
_Strength_: As user
Special Rules: Balanced, Parry, Freestyle.

Balanced: A quarter staff is, especially light and easy to wield. A model armed with a fighting staff gets +1 Initiative in close combat.  

Freestyle: Although a staff does not always require two hands to use it cannot be combined with another weapon, shield, buckler, etc. However it can be combined with the Monks bare hand attack with their other hand for the usual +1 attack for using two weapons.

#### Chain sticks
_Range_: Close Combat
_Strength_: As user
Special Rules: Flurry, Two-handed

Flurry: A set of chain sticks allows its wielder to unleash a furious bludgeoning. A warrior armed with chain sticks gets +2 Attacks. This bonus only applies in the first turn of each hand-to-hard combat. Using chain sticks otherwise counts as having two hand weapons. 

#### Dragon Sword
_Range_: Close Combat
_Strength_: As user +1
Special Rules: Two-handed, Parry.

#### Cathayan Longsword
_Range_: Close Combat
_Strength_ As user
_Special Rules: Parry, Cutting Edge (see axes), Mastercrafted

Mastercrafted: Attacks made with a Cathayan Longsword give the bearer +1 Initiative and +1 Weapon Skill.

#### Fish-hook shot
_Range_: 3"
_Strength_: 3
Special Rules: Thrown weapon, Precise, Caused fall

Thrown weapon: Models using a fish-hook shot do not suffer penalties for range or moving as it is designed for short range use anyway. 

Precise: A model using a fish-hook shot is so well-trained in the use of this weapon that he may attack enemy models that are engaged in close combat. However the hook shot is useless when the monk himself is engaged in close combat. 

Caused fall: The warrior may declare to try and cause an enemy model to fall instead of causing damage. The warrior must roll to hit as normal and then pass a Strength test. If the test is successful, the enemy model counts as knocked down. Apply a +1 modifier to the Strength test against _large_ models. Has no effect on _gargantuan_ models.


### Battle Monks special skills

Battle Monks of Cathay may choose to use the following skill list instead of the standard skill lists. Monks that specialise in these arts are considered have the purest expression of their art. The Emissary may only pick the _Warmonger_ skill from the following, and may do so without giving up their original skills options.


#### Raging Fire
If fighting unarmed the Monk may choose to reduce his Attacks by –1 and thus gain +1 Strength in close combat. The Monk may sacrifice any number of attacks this way. 

#### Great Typhoon
The Monk cannot be intercepted while charging. Additionally, when in combat the Monk may use the Leap ability (descriped in the Speed skills section) to move freely out of combat - entering into a different combat if they choose to, in which case they count as charging.

#### Coursing River
The Monk may triple his Movement whilst running or charging and may run even when there are enemy models within 8”. 

### Human Shield
If two or more models are engaged in close combat with the monk, he may choose to grab one to use it as a shield instead of his normal attacks. To do this he must pass an Initiative test after the first model has attacked, but before the second model attacks. On a successful roll, the monk grabs the first model – the second model directs its full attacks on the friendly model. After the combat phase the model breaks free and the battle goes on as usual. If the roll is failed the second model use their normal attacks. 

### Warmonger
The Emissary may make a Ld test before the battle. If the test is successful, D3+1 Raging Peasants join the warband for the next game (this may exceed the maximum number of warriors). Each Raging Peasant in the warband is subject to Hatred for the duration of the battle. 

### Stuntmaster
While battling inside an enclosed area (such as a building, ruin, or The Pits) the Monk gains +1 WS and +1A. Furthermore at the start of each of their close combat phases they may choose any combination of Common weapons irrespective of what equipment they carry. This represents the Monk's incredible ability to turn the most mundane objects, such as ladders or jars of liquor, into miraculously functional fighting tools.

### Dragon Rage
Mustering up a lifetime's accumulated knowledge of The Blind Monk's teachings, the Monk unleashes a devestating spinning kick with the force of a speeding chariot. Instead of their usual contingent of attacks the Monk may make a single unarmed Dragon Rage attack at +1 Strength. If this attack hits, whether or not it successfully wounds, the target is knocked back D6" away from the Monk through any windows, handrails, or other models behind them. Every model behind the target, friend or foe, is wounded on whatever the target's armour save was (having a warrior with Heavy Armour be kicked into you would therefore wound you on a 3+). Large targets are moved D3" away. Gargantuan targets do not move.

Skills: Dragon Monks may choose from Combat, Academic, Strength & Speed when they gain a new skill - though doing so will prevent them from learning Battle Monk Special Skills. Alternatively they may choose Battle Monk Special Skills, which will prevent them from learning any other types of Skill. This reflects the lifetime of reclusive mastery required to learn these techniques.

Special Rules
Art of Silent Death: Dragon Monks have become masters of the Cathayan art of open-hand fighting. In hand-to-hand combat, if fighting unarmed, they will cause a critical hit on a roll 'to wound' of 5-6 instead of a 6. If the Dragon Monk wields a quarter staff in one hand, only the unarmed attack will cause a critical hit on 5+.
