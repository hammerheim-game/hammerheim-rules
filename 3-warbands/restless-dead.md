# Restless Dead
</div>

A Liche is a necromancer who was wise enough never to expend their own life energy to fuel their spells during their lifetime. As time eats away at their body, they retains their soul which allows them to manipulate magic, which is what separates them from pitiful wraiths. Unfortunately, the undead bodies of the Liche are not capable of retaining magic forever. They must absorb massive amounts of magic through the use of dark rituals and forbidden spells.

The most common ritual involves the devouring of the soul of a human, transforming the soulless human into a mindless zombie under the Liche’s control. This cycle continues until the Liche is eventually discovered, usually if they have preyed on a single location for too long or have inadvertantly fed from the soul of an especially important person.

When a Liche is found, great armies are sent against it - for their ancient legacy of spellcraft and their vast Necromantic knowledge makes them among the most formidable wizards of the Old World. The Liche retaliates by creating armies of undead warriors to defend itself, expending vast amounts of stored magical energy to do so. Win or lose, the Liche is greatly weakened in this process - and the Priests of Sigmar have learned that even in loss they are capable of striking lasting damage against their foes. More often than not, the Liche is so crippled by these battles that it is incapable of recovery.

In this event, the Liche has two options. Most of them wander south to the forest of Loren where they seek the wild and infinite magic of the wood. Some wander north
towards the Chaos Wastes where they are almost always discovered and destroyed en-route. An even smaller percentage go west in ramshackle boats towards the lands of the High Elves. 

So far, only a small handful of Liches have ever lived in their undead state for very long; even fewer return to fighting strength after crippling defeat. There is no safe territory for these creatures, and even other Necromancers or Vampires will invariably attempt to enslave or feed from a weakened Liche. With Mordheim currently being the source of an impossibly volatile magic corruption, the ethereal Liches find themselves invigorated and sustained by the latent magical dust in the air.

### Liche Special Skills
Liches and Necromancers have their own special skills that they may learn upon gaining a skill advance:

#### Corpse Bomb
Special magics and rituals can cause a Zombie to explode when they are near the enemy. Secretly nominate one Zombie at the beginning of the battle to be a Corpse Bomb. If the enemy charges or is charged by the Zombie, it immediately detonates. All models within D6 inches take D3 Strength 4 hits. The detonated Zombie may never be used again as it is splattered in a million pieces! Corpse bombs killed by shooting do not detonate. Only one Zombie at a time can be a corpse bomb although the skill can be taken by both the Necromancer and the Liche. 

#### Deathspeaker
At the start of the battle, the undead player may deploy D3 Zombies for free. These zombies do not count towards the maximum number of models in the warband, but increase the warband’s rating as normal. Zombies created in this way may not be used as Corpse Bombs. These Zombies only last for the duration of the battle.

#### Wraith Touch
The hero may make a Wraith Touch attack instead of their normal attacks in close combat. The hero making a Wraith Touch makes a single unarmed attack, if it hits, it wounds automatically, all rules that apply to unarmed attacks apply to the Wraith Touch. If a Liche uses this skill and wounds, then he may regain one lost wound. This may not take the hero beyond his starting total. Necromancers do not regain wounds with this skill. This skill has no effect on the Possessed or Undead. 

#### Forbidden Rite
If the hero with this skill did not search for rare items during their last exploration phase, then they start the next battle with a pool of D3 additional magic dice, generated as if they had successfully channeled. These bonus dice are retained each round turn, rather than expiring as normal.

### Heroes

#### **1 Liche**
125 gold crowns to hire.	
_A Liche is a powerful undead sorcerer. They journey north in a desperate bid to regain their power in the wyrdstone-soaked ruins of Mordheim after a crippling defeat. Liches are fanatical in their struggle to hang on to their pitiful existence, especially when this close to being forever banished from the realm of the living._	

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 8 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Liches may not carry any non-magical weapons and do not suffer any penalties for this. They may wear any armour from the Undead Equipment list.	
**Skills:** Liches may choose from Academic and Liche Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules	
**Leader:** Any warrior within 6" of the Liche may use its Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.	
**Magic User:** Liches are powerful wizards. They start with two spells rather than the usual one from Necromancy.	
**Fear:** Liches are terrifying Undead creatures and therefore cause fear.	
**Immune to Psychology:** Liches have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.	
**Immune to Poison:** Liches are not affected by any poison.	
**No Pain:** Liches treat a  'stunned’ result on the Injury chart as ‘knocked down’.	
**Eternal:** A Liche can choose to ignore any result on the hero's Serious Injury chart except _Dead_ by taking a permanent -1 on their starting Wound profile. Obviously, a Liche with 1 Wound remaining on their starting profile does not have this option. A Liche that gets a _Dead_ result instead takes a permanent –D3 Wounds on their starting profile. If this takes their starting Wound total to 0 or less, the Liche is killed as normal. 	
**Feed Upon Magic:** A Liche can perform spells that, with the consumption of D3 shards of wyrdstone, can give the Liche a permanent +1 Wound on their starting profile. This can only be used in between battles and cannot be used if the Liche searches for rare items or was put out of action in the previous battle. If the warband does not have enough wyrdstone to complete the spell, then the wyrdstone is consumed anyway and the Liche does not gain the Wound. 	
**Warrior Wizard:** The Liche may wear armour and cast spells. Indeed, it is often the clothing and armour alone that gives the Liche substance and form.	
**Advancement:** If a Liche gets an advance roll of +1 Wound, they may instead pick a new skill from their
available lists. 



#### **0-1 Necromancer**
40 gold crowns to hire	
_Necromancers who travel with Liches are apprentices to the dark arts of Necromancy. They are the only living thing that a Liche will tolerate in its proximity!_

___

**Weapons/Armour:** Necromancers may choose equipment from the Undead Equipment List.	
**Skills:** Necromancers may choose from Academic, Speed, and Liche Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules	
**Magic User:** Necromancers are wizards being trained by their Liche masters in the art of Necromancy and so are able to use Necromancy magic. They start out knowing one of the two spells known by their Liche masters, chosen by the player.	
**Apprentices:** Necromancers may only ever know spells known by their Liche masters. Even if they did know spells the Liche didn’t, they wouldn’t dare use them for fear of their master’s response for their arrogance! If the Liche is ever killed, the Necromancer can continue to learn magic spells as a normal wizard, ignoring the Apprentice rule. 	
**Gofer:** as an Apprentice, the Necromancer spends much of their time running errands for their Liche masters and over the years get exceptionally good at it. When a Necromancer searches for rare items, they roll 3D6 and pick the two highest.

#### 0-4 Wights	
35 gold crowns to hire

You may roll ‘to wound’ as normal to determine if it is a ‘critical hit’, but even a failed ‘to wound’ roll will still cause a wound if a 6 was rolled first ‘to hit. Their attacks count as magical. Has no effect against Demonic or Undead targets.

**Immune to Psychology:** Wights have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.	
**Immune to Poison:** Wights are not affected by any poison.

#### 0-3 Grave Guard
25 gold crowns to hire

#### 0-2 Scarecrows
65 gold crowns to hire	
_Some sorcerors have been known to create horrible unliving forms that are impervious to pain and notoriously difficult to stop. In order to maintain secrecy, a cunning wizard disguises their twisted
supernatural bodyguard as something more common. With its ordinary appearance the golem is granted
enough freedom to move around undetected. These lanky constructs are fashioned from straw to resemble
scarecrows used by farmers to frighten birds away from crops. No one gives them so much as a passing glance... that is, until they begin to move!_

| | 5 | 4 | 0 | 4 | 3(6) | 1 | 3 | 2 | 10 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** The scarecrow carries no equipment and suffers no penalties for this. 

##### Special Rules

**Undead:** Scarecrows have all the same Special Rules as Zombies.	
**No Substance:** The scarecrow is incredibly difficult to take down with shooting as there are few vital parts to hit. The scarecrow counts as having a T6 against all shooting and magical missiles, likewise, a scarecrow is immune to critical hits caused by shooting. The exception to this rule is missile weapons or spells that are fire based which deal damage as normal.	 
**Flammable:** The scarecrow is primarily ratty cloth, straw and preserved body parts so as a result they burn very easily. They have the _Flammable_ special rule.	
**Animated Construct:** Powerful constructs such as scarecrows require much more concentration from their summoners than normal skeletons or zombies to remain animated. The scarecrow is controlled by either the Liche or the Necromancer (note down on the warband roster which), but each may only control one at a time, so only a warband with both a Liche and a Necromancer may ever take two Scarecrows. If the
Liche or the Necromancer is for some reason unable to participate in a battle, their Scarecrow will also be unable to participate.
