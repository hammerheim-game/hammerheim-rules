Disease and pestilence are common among the Skaven, who live in such constantly filth-ridden proximity to one another that simple ailments rapidly become enormous plagues that cull entire populations. Sometimes these plagues manage to spread to the surface-dwelling Humans, such as the Black Plague, but more often than not these contagions devestate the Skaven.

Just as cults of Nurgle will typically arise in plague-ridden Human settlements in the hope that worship of the god of disease will merit them some measure of resistance. On the other side of the world, in Lustria, when an outbreak began to exterminate the local clans many took to a far more zealous worship of The Horned Rat for much the same reasons, believing that their diseases were just another masterful mechanation from their deity to inflict distruction upon their enemies. To an extent they were correct.

The Skaven that survived the plague were horrendous, pox-riddled monsters. Their bodies had wasted, as too had much of their brains, and yet in spite of this they had an almost unnatural resilience to them that served them incredibly well against the Lizardmen during their subsequent invasion.

Other Skaven clans were quick to cast away this new clan for fear of contracting another plague, but their efforts were largely fruitless. As Clan Pestilens spread its contagions and other smaller clans became infected, they rushed to embrace the ways of Pestilens and before long had become so large and influential that they are now considered to be arguably the most powerful Clan in Skavendom.
  
  As is so often the case, at its heart is Warpstone. Clan Pestilens' weapons of war typically involve the spread of gas to infect their foes, with great war machines hurling caustic liquid that vapourises mid air, or hollow flails known as Censers with small shards of Warpstone inside that billow fumes with each swing.

Try as their Eshin rivals might to underplay Mordheim's significance, Pestilens has already dispatched agents to investigate it.

### Henchmen


#### Plague Novices
20 gold crowns to hire	
_They are the lower rank of Clan Pestilens. They infest the Mordheim

clouds of pestilential fumes. Dream of every Plague Novice is to be

chanting the Liturgicus Infecticus._

#### 0-1 Rat Ogre
175 Gold Crowns	
_While Plague Monks thrive in the unfeeling melee there are occasionally foes with armour too heavy for the wild strikes of their crude, blunt swords to penetrate. Rat Ogres purchased by Pestilens warbands rarely live long before succumbing to disease, so they are made vigorous use of. _
