#### Clan Pestilens

Jarod glanced down the street... All seemed clear. He could not immediately tell why, but he was sure someone, or something was there.
Maybe it was just that strange odour hanging around the ruins here. He shivered, although Mordheim seemed to have its own special smell,
this made him think of death.
A sudden noise made him jump up and bring his crossbow to bear on the still empty street. A strange mist started to creep in and soft
squeaks could be made out. As Jarod sounded the alarm, two figures rushed towards him. Dressed in tattered cloaks, they wielded what
looked like a spiked censer. Almost suffocating in the bellowing smoke, he fired his crossbow. Then, just before the spiked smoking ball
smashed his skull, he saw two red gleaming eyes in a disease ridden skaven face.
In the Old World sickness and plague are a fact of life and
many people blame rats for spreading contagion. They are
more right than they know.
Clan Pestilens exist to spread plague and pestilence through
their foul rites and experiments. They have been chosen by
the Horned Rat himself as his Disciples of Decay and are
responsible for more deaths than any other clan, mainly due
to the plagues and diseases they have unleashed on the cities
and empires in the Old World. The main strongholds of Clan
Pestilens consist of captured Slann temple-cities in the humid
jungles of Lustria and a mighty stronghold in the southlands.
They also have their own quarter in Skavenblight,
maintaining their position as one of the most powerful clans
in the Skaven Under-Empire.
Plague Monks favour knives and staffs while the higher
ranked members carry heavier weapons and even warplock
pistols. The knives are long and serrated and are often rusty
or smeared in rotten corpses to ensure that the any non-lethal
wound becomes infected. The Clan members do not need to
wear armor since their bodies are hardened by the diseases
they carry they feel little pain, they rely on their thick fur to
protect them. The robes themselves offer protection equal to
soft leather and will be considered as light armor when
combined with the scattered pieces of chain mail or plate that
some plague monks do wear underneath their putrid robes.
