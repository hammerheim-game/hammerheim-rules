Disease and pestilence are common among the Skaven, who live in such constant filth-ridden proximity to one another that simple ailments rapidly become enormous plagues that cull entire populations. Sometimes these plagues manage to spread to the surface-dwelling Humans, such as the Black Plague, but more often than not these contagions devestate the Skaven.

Just as cults of Nurgle will typically arise in plague-ridden Human settlements in the hope that worship of the god of disease will endow them with some measure of resistance, on the other side of the world, in Lustria, when an outbreak began to exterminate the local clans many took to a far more zealous worship of The Horned Rat for much the same reasons. They believed that their diseases were just another masterful machination from their deity to inflict destruction upon their enemies. To an extent they were correct.

The Skaven that survived the plague were horrendous, pox-riddled monsters. Their bodies had wasted, as too had much of their brains, and yet in spite of this they had an almost unnatural resilience that served them incredibly well against the Lizardmen during their Skavens' subsequent invasion.

Other Skaven clans were quick to cast away this new clan for fear of contracting another plague, but their efforts were largely fruitless. As Clan Pestilens spread its contagions other smaller clans became infected, and they rushed to embrace the ways of Pestilens. Before long Clan Pestilens had become so large and influential that they are now considered to be arguably the most powerful Clan in Skavendom.
  
  As is so often the case, at its heart is Warpstone. Clan Pestilens' weapons of war typically involve the spread of gas to infect their foes, with great war machines hurling caustic liquid that vapourises mid air, or hollow flails known as Censers with small shards of Warpstone inside that billow fumes with each swing.

Try as their Eshin rivals might to underplay Mordheim's significance, Pestilens has already dispatched agents to investigate it.

```
```

>#### Disease Dagger
*Disease Daggers come on all variety of shapes, and with varying toxins coating their blades. The premise behind them however is the same - a virulent ooze coats the blade of a small and lightweight dagger so thickly that every swing causes flecks of the highly contagious slime to spatter over the wielder's foe. Even the slightest droplet on the lip or eye is enough to incapacitate all but the sturdiest of foes as they succumb to rapid infection.* 
**Range:** Close Combat; **Strength:** As User  
**Special Rules:** Dagger, Infection.   
>##### Special Rules
**Infection:** If the warrior using a Disease Dagger rolls a 6 on their 'To Hit' roll then the green ooze that soaks the dagger has infected the target - even the tiniest scratch will do. The target must take an immediate Toughness test or suffer an additional wound with no armour saves allowed. This occurs in addition to the normal effects of the hit, irrespective of whether the normal hit wounds. Has no effect on enemies that are _Immune to Poison_.


<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


>#### Plague Sword
*Blessed by the thirteen unholy rituals of Nurglitch, the most wealthy and respected Priests are capable of instilling magical corruption into their weapons. Swords blessed in this way seem to boil with effervecent rust, and wounds inflicted with them suffer rapid and unchecked contagion. Small cuts become gaping wounds as the brown and yellow corruption spreads, making these weapons as horrific as they are effective.*  
**Range:** Close Combat; **Strength:** As User  
**Special Rules:** Parry, Contagion.
>##### Special rules
**Contagion:** Contagion gives the weapon the Multiple Wounds (2) special rule on enemies that are not _Immune to Poison._  



<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


>#### Censer
**Range:** Close Combat; **Strength:** As User +2   
**Special Rules:** Enhanced Flail, Fog of Death.
>##### Special rules
**Enhanced Flail:** The Censer works exactly as a Flail, and skills that effect Flails effect Censers too.  
**Fog of Death:** At the start of each Close Combat Phase every model, friend or foe, in base contact with a model armed with a Censer must take a Toughness Test or suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. The wielder must take this test too, but only fails on a 6.

### Henchmen


#### Plague Novices
20 gold crowns to hire  
_They are the lower rank of Clan Pestilens. They infest the Mordheim
streets, coming just before the terrible Plague Monks and their
clouds of pestilential fumes. The dream of every Plague Novice is to be
chosen some day to be a Monk, and to be given the privilege of
chanting the Liturgicus Infecticus._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Plague Novices may choose equipment from the Clan Pestilens Equipment List.


#### Giant Rats
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Giant Rats are the largest, hungriest, and boldest vermin from which the Skaven evolved. Whether the presence of Skaven enhances the naturally present vermin or not is a subject of whispered debate and rumour - but in either case they are a strong indicator of Skaven corruption._

##### Special Rules 
**Animals**: Giant Rats do not gain experience. 
**Low Upkeep**: Giant Rats largely look after themselves, even capable of sustaining themselves on chewed-up rotted wood, and are largely overlooked by their warband. For the purposes of warband size (such as selling Wyrdstone and Rout Tests) Giant Rats only count as half a model.

```

#### 0-1 Clan Pestilens Rat Ogre
175 Gold Crowns 
*Resilient as they are, Plague Monks rely on wild and often literally blind thrashing to hew their way through crowds. This momentum is most often hampered by foes with armour too heavy to barrel through with rusted blades, and it is for this reason that Clan Pestilens spends much of its wealth on the acquisition of Rat Ogres from Clan Moulder. Rat Ogres purchased by Pestilens warbands rarely live long before succumbing to disease however, so they are made vigorous use of. *

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Rat Ogres do not use weapons, though suffer no penalties for doing so.
##### Special Rules 
**Unthinking Creature**: Whatever intelligence the Rat Ogre once had is gone. It may never gain experience. 
**Stupidity**: Rat Ogres are not bred for their intelligence and require constant stimulation to function. They have the _Stupidity_ special rule.      
**Frenzy:** Pestilens Rat Ogres are exceptionally rabid, slavering monstrosities. They have the _Frenzy_ special rule.  
**Large:** Rat Ogres are _Large_ sized.
