#### Outlaw Warband

To the north of the River Stir lies the Great Forest, a vast
expanse of woodland that fills the very heart of the Empire.
Bounded along its southern edge by the river, this, the largest
forest of the known world, extends league upon league as far
as any man can see. Just at its southernmost, the River Stir
separates a small part of the forest from the main bulk of the
woodland and this smaller area of forest is known locally as
Stirwood. Small though Stirwood may be – indeed, this part
of the forest is not even on the same scale as the sacred Forest
of Loren, but, as many say, size isn’t everything – Stirwood
Forest is nevertheless still large enough to get lost in, and
many have done so, some by accident and some by design.
Stirwood lies just north of the noble city of Nuln and to the
west of Wurtbad, where law and order are strictly enforced,
at least they are strictly enforced once the City Guards have
finally managed to catch up with those who break the
Count’s law. The Elector Count of Stirland was well known
as a man that one should not cross. Those that did so were
inevitably declared as ‘outlaws’ and were pursued from the
cities. Even the most petty of criminals, some still quite
young, could be declared ‘outlaw’ and had little option but to
flee to the countryside. Many perished, both young and old,
but some made it to Stirwood where they could lay low.
During their time in Stirwood, some would band together and
become groups of outlaws, rather than just attempting to
survive on their own. The forest was a perfect training ground
to develop their skills, particularly in archery, where even the
hunting of the wild deer, the Count’s deer, was a crime in
itself. Illicit deer-hunting was not their only past-time as
many an unwary traveller, passing unsuspectingly through
the forest, would find themselves ambushed and relieved of
their goods.
Monks also lived in these parts, holy men who spent their
time in devotion to the blessed Sigmar. Usually they dwelt
alone in contemplation, but were often trusted by the local
groups of outlaws that they came into contact with and
attended to their spiritual needs, and, when the occasion
arose, also attended to their wounds.

In the years that followed the sighting of the twin-tailed star
in the sky, it was inevitable that tales of Mordheim would
have travelled down the waters of the River Stir. Tales of
strange sights and great riches would easily have reached the
inhabitants of Stirwood Forest. Temptations of this enormous
wealth that was rumoured to be in the shattered city would
have been hard for any group of outlaws to resist.
##### Special Rules

All warriors in an Outlaws warband may be equipped with
only one missile weapon at any time. All warriors must carry
a type of bow, but not crossbows, as part of their equipment.
So, even if an Outlaw acquires skills that allow him to use
additional ballistic weaponry, he cannot do so. The only
exception to this is the Monk who may choose to carry a
bow, but is not compelled to do so.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral.
##### Choice of Warriors

An Outlaw warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns that you can use to recruit
and equip your warband. The maximum number of warriors
in the warband is 15.
Bandit Leader: Each Outlaw warband must have one Bandit
Leader: no more, no less!
Champion: Your warband may include up to two
Champions.
Petty Thieves: Your warband may include up to two Petty

##### Heroes

1 Bandit Leader
60 Gold Crowns to hire
A Bandit Leader is a professional cutthroat, a hardened criminal. His
presence along the shadowy forest tracks of Stirwood has often
meant the untimely demise of many a passing traveller. Other
Outlaws will follow him, inspired as much by his ruthlessness as by
his prowess.

0-1 Monk
35 Gold Crowns to hire
It is surprisingly common for pious Monks to become lost in Stirland,
wrongfully believing that their faith alone will preserve and sustain
them. Carrying little more than their robes and the most basic
supplies they are usually found by the native Outlaw warbands half
starved and hopeless. Priests are often left to their fate, the overly
zealous followers of Sigmar and Ulric being too bull-headed to be worth
an Outlaw's time, but Monks can sometimes find themselves recipient to
surprising charity from these warbands. These Monks often find themselves
enamoured with the Outlaws and become a part of the famiy.

0-2 Petty Thieves
20 Gold Crowns to hire
Many youths who are caught by the City Guards in the act of
thieving are compelled to flee the city and take up a place among
the trees of Stirwood Forest. Although young, they are still keen
enough to prove their worth to their fellow outlaws.

Outlaws

These warriors form the basis of any group of bandits. Ruthless to

knife between somebody’s ribs for the promise of just a few groats.
