# Clan Eshin
</div>

Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared his world with another and altogether different race. There
have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer, scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the world of Man, undermining their great cities, infiltrating their sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world-spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests.

These creatures call themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the spawn of an older age of chaos and mutation. Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries they have been content to feed upon their ruins, to seed plague in their cities, and spread contagion amongst their lands. At least they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has suddenly changed.

Now, the destruction of Mordheim has created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind. Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for the stones of power that humans in their ignorance call Wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul sorceries and industries.

Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has appeared – a dark blessing from the skies! For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan fights Clan the world over, each struggling for dominance in the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race. 

Mordheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else the City of the Damned would already be overrun with ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to  gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan nests.

The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes, they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned Rat, their ever hungering and hideous god. There are none better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient. Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the Damned.
