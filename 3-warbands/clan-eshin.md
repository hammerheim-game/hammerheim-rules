#### Clan Eshin

Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared
his world with another and altogether different race. There
have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a
scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer,
scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these
creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the
world of man, undermining his great cities, infiltrating his
sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world
spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests. These creatures call
themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the mutant spawn of
an older age of chaos and mutation.
Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from
their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries
they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague
in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least
they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has
suddenly changed. Now the destruction of Hammerheim has
created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind.
Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for
the stones of power that men in their ignorance call
wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as
warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of
gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that
commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that
spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their
blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul
sorceries. Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has
been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown
increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has
appeared – a dark blessing from the skies!
For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune
time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is
divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan
fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of
the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race.
Hammerheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else
the City of the Damned would already be overrun with
ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this
secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous
armies into Hammerheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of
Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to

gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan
nests.
The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their
task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes,
they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the
thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors
practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned
Rat, their ever hungering and hideous god. There are none
better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure
of Hammerheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient.
Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Hammerheim
there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions
upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the
Damned.
