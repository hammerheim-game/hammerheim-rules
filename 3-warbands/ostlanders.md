# Ostlanders
</div>

_‘My only crime was to get in a brawl with some pig farmer outside  the Donkey’s Nut Tavern and the next thing I knew a dozen of his "brothers" were after my blood!’_

The Principality of Ostland is the most sparsely inhabited of all of the Empire’s Electoral Provinces. Its people have more ties with the land of Kislev to the north than they do to their countrymen to the south. This is because the Forest of Shadows and the Middle Mountains form two natural barriers between Ostland and the rest of the Empire, both of which are extremely inhospitable. Within the Forest of Shadows are vast amounts of wild game but also darker creatures such as Beastmen, Forest Goblins, and carniverous plants. The Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the Empire and their peaks are inhabited by a large number of Ogres.

Ostland’s isolation has greatly shaped its inhabitants and they are a poor but hardy folk. Each small village lives barely above subsistence levels and is usually composed of one large extended family. The men of Ostland are broad and often carry much of their weight in their gut, while the women tend to either be tall and whippet thin or short and stout like Dwarfs. Married folk are usually dirt farmers who also gather roots, tubers and nuts in the forests, while the young and unmarried spend their lives as trappers and hunters. The worship of Taal, the God of Forests and Beasts, is very popular in the region although there is some worship of Taal’s wife Ryha (though outlawed by Imperial Law) and his brother Ulric in the more westerly villages.

While not warlike by nature, Ostlanders are never opposed to a good honest drunken brawl and with their love of dark ales these sorts of scraps are not uncommon. During the Great War against Chaos, Ostlanders rallied in great numbers to wield bow and spear in defence of their Kislevite neighbours. More than any other part of the Empire, Ostland has tasted the lash of Chaos and their hatred of the evil ones knows no bounds.

### Special Rules
**Self-Sufficient:** Ostlanders are infamous for their isolationism and their pride in being able to pull themselves up by their  bootstraps in even the most trying of circumstances. As a consequence they are loathe to share their hard-earned gold  with outsiders, and as a result they may never form Formal Alliances during any scenario with lootable treasure (Monster Hunt, Raven Barracks, Hidden Treasure etc).   
**Nouveau Riche:** Ostlanders are almost universally poor. Many Ostlanders never see coined money in their entire life and those that do are often overcome with giddiness at the mere sight of wealth. They therefore entrust all things financial to their warband leader, as no Ostlander with coin can be trusted to go and purchase the rare items they are instructed to find. Only the warband leader may search for rare items between games.   
**You Mess With One of Us You Mess With All Of Us!:** Ostlanders will never pay any ransom, even the minimum quantity they would normally have to accept. They will always attempt rescue missions instead, though they can decide simply to leave the captive to their fate if 'E's not worth it.  
**Bar Room Brawlers:** All Ostlanders, including the Ogre, automatically begin the campaign with the Pugilist skill.
**Alignment:** The Warband's Alignment may be either Lawful/Neutral, or Neutral.

```
```


### Heroes

#### **1 Elder**
60 gold crowns to hire. 
_In Ostland, the oldest (or more often biggest) in the village is given the title ‘Elder’. Their word is greatly respected and only at their urging would the family of an entire village pack up and travel to Mordheim to seek their fortune._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** The Elder may choose equipment from the Yer Family A'ite! Equipment List.   
**Skills:** The Elder may choose from Combat, Strength, Speed, and Ostland Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules 
**Leader:** Any allied warrior within 6" of the Elder may use their Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests. 
**Bling:** While the Elders are the ones deemed fiscally responsible in Ostlander warbands the reality is that their impulse control is barely greater than that of their juniors, and being entrusted a whole warband's worth of wealth usually merits disastrous consequences. As a result Ostlander warbands tend to be a group of ragged dirt-peasants led by an incredibly kitted-out leader. Elders start with the Magic Item skill, but no equipment after the starting roster has been drawn up may be ever be bought for the warband until the Elder has maxmised the amount of magic items they are carrying.

If the Hammerheim rules are not being used, the Ostlanders may purchase an Enchanted Sword for 75 Gold that grants +1 Strength and +1 Attack.




#### **0-1 Priest of Taal**
45 gold crowns to hire. 
_It is said that every priest of Taal is born during the darkest phase of the moon. Those who are accepted into the service of Taal are loners by nature and spend their time wandering the untamed forests of the Northern Empire. It is unclear why the priests of the forest have begun to join bands of Ostlanders in their delvings into the ruined city of Mordheim, for the servants of Taal keep their own counsel. Suffice to say that the Forest-God is clearly building a strong presence both in and around the darkened ruins as more and more animals begin to fill the surrounding forests..._

#### 0-4 Blood Brothers
35 gold crowns to hire  
_Blood Brothers form the inner circle of the Ostlander "family", though rarely are they actually blood relatives. Families in Ostland are formed through drunken song and reverie, with large partially comatose men embracing and sobbing into each others' shoulders and declaring brotherhood, while drink-sodden women capriciously flirt with one another._

### Henchmen


#### Kin
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Kin tend to be the drinking buddies of the Blood Brothers. They are little more than the tavern bums, most often joining warbands during a drunken stupor they later sorely regret._

#### 0-5 Kith
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Kith are the better-adjusted members of Ostland warbands. They have more in common with a Mercenary than anything else, and may actually share legitimate blood with the Elder, embarking on expeditions out of a sense of respect or duty to their relatives._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Kith may choose from the Yer Family A'ite! Equipment List.




#### 0-1 Ogre
150 gold crowns to hire 
_More than anywhere else in the Empire Ogres are most commonplace within the hilly, pine forested landscape of Ostland. These brutish creatures are very sought after by the rough mountain men of Ostland as muscle in the Warband. An Ogre’s strength is near-legendary and their ability to sustain an awful lot of punishment during a fight make these the perfect shock troops of any Warband. Of course, an Ogre’s appetite is nearly as well renowned as their fighting abilities and so they are rather expensive to keep - not least because they will happily drink an entire warband's worth of ale by themselves, much to their companions' chagrin._  

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  | 6 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 6 |
___

**Weapons/Armour:** Ogres may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Yer Family A'ite! Equipment List.
##### Special Rules
**Fear:** Ogres are large, threatening creatures that cause _Fear_. 
**Large:** Ogres are _Large_ sized. 
**Skills:** An Ogre who becomes a Hero as a result of "Lad’s Got Talent!" may choose from the Combat, Strength, and Ostland Special Skills. 
**Slow Witted:** Although Ogres are capable of earning experience and bettering themselves they are not the smartestof creatures. Ogres only gain advances at half the rate ofeveryone else (I.e. they must accrue twice as muchexperience as normal to get an advance).
