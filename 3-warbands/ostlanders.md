#### Ostlander

‘My only crime was to get in a brawl with some pig farmer outside of the Donkey’s Nut Tavern and the next thing I knew a
dozen of his brothers were after my blood.’ Udo Verkonnen, Freesword
The Principality of Ostland is the most sparsely inhabited of
all of the Empire’s Electoral Provinces. Its people have more
ties with the land of Kislev to the north than they do to their
countrymen to the south. This is because the Forest of
Shadows and the Middle Mountains form two natural barriers
between Ostland and the rest of the Empire. Within the Forest
of Shadows are vast amounts of wild game but also darker
creatures such as Chaos Beastmen and Forest Goblins. The
Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the
Empire and their peaks are inhabited by a large number of
Ogres.
Ostland’s isolation has greatly shaped its inhabitants and they
are a poor but hardy folk. Each small village lives barely
above subsistence levels and is usually composed of one
large extended family. The men of Ostland are tall and broad-
shouldered while the women tend to either be tall and
whippet thin or short and stout. Married men are usually dirt
farmers who also gather roots, tubers and nuts in the forests,
while unmarried men spend their lives as trappers and
hunters. The worship of Taal, the God of Forests and Beasts,
is very popular in the region although there is some worship
of Taal’s wife Ryha and his brother Ulric in the more
westerly villages.
While not warlike by nature, Ostlanders are never opposed to
a good honest drunken brawl and with their love of dark ales
these sorts of scraps are not uncommon. During the Great
War against Chaos, Ostlanders rallied in great numbers to
wield bow and spear in defence of their Kislevite neighbours.
More than any other part of the Empire, Ostland has tasted
the lash of Chaos and their hatred of the evil ones knows no
bounds.

##### Special Rules

Self-Sufficient: Ostlanders are infamous for their isolationism
and their pride in being able to pull themselves up by their 
bootstraps in even the most trying of circumstances. As a 
consequence they are loathe to share their hard-earned gold 
with outsiders, and as a result they may never form Formal
Alliances during any scenario with lootable treasure (Monster
Hunt, Raven Barracks, Hidden Treasure etc).
Nouveau Riche: Ostlanders are almost universally poor. Many 
Ostlanders never see coined money in their entire life and those
that do are often overcome with giddiness at the mere sight of
wealth. They therefore entrust all things financial to their 
warband leader, as no Ostlander with coin can be trusted to go
and purchase the rare items they are instructed to find. Only 
the warband leader may search for rare items between games, and
they may not trade these items to other warband members.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### Choice of Warriors

An Ostlander Warband is often made up of an extended
family of Ostlanders. Fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and
even the occasion tough-as-nails aunt all join together to form
the Warband. The ‘family’ must include a minimum of 3
models and a maximum of 15. You have 500 Gold Crowns
that you can use to recruit your initial warband.
Elder: Each Ostlander Warband must have one Elder, no
more, no less!
Blood-Brothers: Your Warband may include up to 2 Blood-
Brothers.
Priest of Taal: Your Warband may include up to 1 Priest of
Taal.
Kin: You may have any number of Kin.
Ruffians: Your Warband may include up to 5 Ruffians.
Jaeger: Your Warband may include up to 7 Jaeger.
Ogre: Your Warband may include one Ogre. There isn’t
enough food for more than one!
##### Starting Experience

##### Heroes

1 Elder
60 Gold Crowns to hire
In Ostland, the oldest (or more often biggest) man in the village is
given the title ‘Elder’. His word is greatly respected and only at his
urging would the manhood of an entire village pack up and travel to
Mordheim to seek their fortune.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
4 4 4 3 3 1 4 1 8
Weapons/Armor: An Elder may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Ostlander Equipment
list.
Skills: The Elder may choose from Combat, Shooting,
Strength & Speed when he gains a new skill. In addition, the
Elder may choose from the Ostlander Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Elder may use his
Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership tests.
Bling: While the Elders are the ones deemed fiscally responsible
in Ostlander warbands the reality is that their impulse control
is barely greater than that of their juniors, and being entrusted
a whole warband's worth of wealth usually merits disastrous 
consequences. As a result Ostlander warbands tend to be a group
of ragged dirt-peasants led by an incredibly kitted-out leader.
Elders start with Magical Aptitude (1), allowing them to take 
up to 25 points of magic items, but no equipment after the 
starting roster has been drawn up may be bought for the warband
until the Elder has maxmised the amount of magic items they are carrying.

0-2 Blood-Brothers
35 Gold Crowns to hire
Ostland villages are usually composed of a single extended family.
Everyone is everyone else’s uncle, cousin or brother (and sometimes
their own!). Rather than trying to keep all of these relations straight
the most respected men in the village (aside from the Elder) are
referred to simply as Blood-Brothers.

weapons and armor chosen from the Ostlander Equipment
list.
Skills: The Blood-Brothers may choose from Combat &
Strength, when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Blood-
Brothers may choose from the Ostlander Special Skill list.


0-1 Priest of Taal
45 Gold Crowns to hire
It is said that every priest of Taal is born during the darkest phase of
the moon. Those who are accepted into the service of Taal are
loners by nature and spend their time wandering the untamed
forests of the Northern Empire. It is unclear why the priests of the
forest have begun to join bands of Ostlanders in their delvings into
the ruined city of Mordheim – for the servants of Taal keep their
own counsel. Suffice to say that the Forest-God is clearly building a
strong presence both in and around the darkened ruins as more and
more animals begin to fill the surrounding forests...

Weapons/Armor: A Priest of Taal may be equipped with
weapons chosen from the Ostlander Equipment list.
Skills: The Priest of Taal may choose from Combat,
Academic, Strength, & Speed when he gains a new skill. In
addition, the Priest of Taal may choose from the Ostlander
Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Prayer User: The Priest of Taal is a servant of Taal and may
use the Prayers of Taal as detailed in the Magic section and
the Priest of Taal start with one prays generated at random.
See the Magic section for details. In addition the Priest of
Taal may learn a new Prayer instead on a new skill.
Strictures: Priests of Taal may never wear armor.
##### Henchmen

(Brought in groups of 1-5)
Kin
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Most of the warriors in an Ostlander Warband are brothers and
cousins of the Elder. Many are married men with children to
support and the ruins of Mordheim are a lure that few poor villagers
can resist.

Weapons/Armor: Kin may be equipped with weapons and
armor chosen from the Ostlander Equipment list.

0-1 Ogre
160 Gold Crowns to hire
More than anywhere in the Empire Ogres are most commonplace
within the hilly, pine forested landscape of Ostland. These brutish
creatures are very sought after by the rough mountain men of
Ostland as muscle in the Warband. An Ogre’s strength is near
legendary and their ability to sustain an awful lot of punishment
during a fight make these the perfect shock troops of any Warband.
Of course, an Ogre’s appetite is nearly as well renowned as their
fighting abilities and so they are rather expensive to keep.

Weapons/Armor: Ogre-kin may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Ogre-kin Equipment list.
Special Rules
Fear: Ogre-kin are large, threatening creatures that cause
Fear. See the Psychology section for details.
Large: Ogre-kin are huge, lumbering creatures and therefore
make tempting targets for archers. Any model may shoot at
an Ogre-kin, even if it is not the closest target.
Skills: An Ogre-kin who becomes a Hero as a result of The
Lad’s Got Talent may choose from the Combat and Strength
skills.
Slow Witted: Although Ogres are capable of earning
experience and bettering themselves they are not the smartest
of creatures. Ogres only gain advances at half the rate of
everyone else (I.e. they must accrue twice as much
experience as normal to get an advance).

0-7 Jaeger
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Some Ostlander men choose not to marry but instead to spend their
times alone in the forests of the Old World. While these rangers do
not share the close family bonds of a typical Ostlander Blood-kin
they are well respected for their knowledge of the woods and their
rugged determination. Poor Jaeger usually wield a simple home-
made bow but it is every Jaeger’s dream to one day own a
blackpowder weapon and hunting rifle, especially double-barrelled
versions, as these are a sign of great prestige amongst the hunters of
the deep woods.

Weapons/Armor: Jaeger may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Jaeger Equipment list.
 
0-5 Ruffians
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Although every Ostlander loves his ale, a few men in every village
take this love to extremes. Never sober and rarely conscious these
buffoons stagger their way through the streets of Mordheim yelling
slurred insults at whomever they meet, committing petty acts of
vandalism and generally making a mess of things. This comic
behaviour is often misconstrued into a false belief that they are
harmless, a belief that many live to regret. Fuelled by vast quantities
of booze these are very dangerous, unpredictable men indeed who
will shove a broken bottle into your face as soon as laugh heartily
and burst into song!

Weapons/Armor: Ruffians may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Ruffians Equipment list.
Ruffians never use missile weapons, as their depth perception
leaves a bit to be desired, even if they gain an Advance roll
which would otherwise allow them to do so.
Special Rules
Drunk: Ruffians are blasted out of their tiny minds on rotgut
spirits and cheap ale. As such, they automatically pass all
Leadership based tests they are required to take.
No Respect: Ruffians are objects of a strange mix of pity and
abject fear for their fellows and may never become a
Warband leader.
