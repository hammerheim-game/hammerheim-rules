#### Bretonnia Crusades

By Sir Tomaso De Merrigan
This is a time when the Empire is being torn apart from
within. A time when there is no Emperor and the lands are
increasingly divided, as individual cities look to their own
lords and mercantile Burgomeisters gain in power through
gold. Where corruption flows like effluent down the River
Reik and conspiracy is rife throughout the land. By contrast,
happy is the land of Bretonnia where chivalry reigns, honour
is upheld and the Lady of the Lake still bestows her favour on
those deemed worthy. To the knights of Bretonnia Mordheim
is a vile place where virtue and order have been discarded.
Where a proud city once stood nightmarish creatures now
wander the streets and mix with men in dens of corruption
and squalor. It is therefore considered extremely virtuous for
a knight to embark on a spiritual quest to Mordheim, seeking
to achieve honour in battle and perhaps earn the favour of the
Lady of the Lake herself. In Mordheim a knight’s courage
and valour will be thoroughly tested, but so much the better,
because with hardship come honour.
A Questing Knight will relinquish his castle and domain to
set out on such a journey. He becomes free from any
obligation to defend a domain and will now seek a road
leading to new adventures. A Questing Knight has put all
worldly ambitions aside and is accorded a rank far greater
then even the most powerful dukes of the land. Such a
gesture is considered particularly noble, and it is not
uncommon for other knights and common folk to flock to the
Questing Knights aid. Knights Errant in particular are eager
for adventure and a chance to win honour by a feat of arms,
so will often join a Questing Knight on his journey. By the
time the Questing Knight leaves the fair lands of Bretonnia
he will have a sizable retinue following him, ready to fight
for the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake.
Once on a quest a Knight will be spurred on by dreams and
visions often visited upon him by the Lady of the Lake. This
leads him ever onwards and inspires and encourages him on
his quest. In time he hopes that through his deeds and valour
he will earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake and she will
let him drink from the Grail of Life. This is the final reward
for a knight, and on finding the Grail he will return to
Bretonnia to protect its people. Until that time though, he is
bound to fight the enemies of virtue and order and to endure
incalculable hardships.

##### Special Rules

Before heading into battle Bretonnian Knights kneel and pray
to the Lady of the Lake, avowing to fight to the death for
honour and justice. Before playing a game of Mordheim
make a Leadership test against the Leadership characteristic
of the warbands leader. If the test is successful the Lady of
the Lake has bestowed her blessing on the warband. The
blessing takes the form of a powerful curse upon the enemies
of chivalry, and in particular upon those that make use of the
foul and dishonourable weapons of mass destruction. Any
model in the opposing warband who wishes to fire a black
powder weapon must roll a D6 and score 4+ to overcome the
curse, otherwise they may not fire the weapon. The opposing
player must test each time they wish to fire such a weapon.
Models armed with other shooting weapons, such as bows
and crossbows, do not have to test unless they dare raise their
weapons against the gallant Knights of Bretonnia. If any
enemy model wishes to shoot at a Bretonnian Knight
(Questing Knights and Errants only), then they must first roll
a 4+ on a D6 to overcome the curse.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.

wonder then that many a Questing Knight will journey to Mordheim.
