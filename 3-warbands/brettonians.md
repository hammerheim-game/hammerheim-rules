# Bretonnian Crusaders
</div>


This is a time when the Empire is being torn apart from within. A time when there is no Emperor and the lands are increasingly divided, as individual cities look to their own lords and mercantile Burgomeisters gain in power through gold. Where corruption flows like effluent down the River Reik and conspiracy is rife throughout the land.

By contrast, happy is the land of Bretonnia where chivalry reigns, honour is upheld and the Lady of the Lake still bestows her favour on those deemed worthy. To the knights of Bretonnia Mordheim is a vile place where virtue and order have been discarded. Where a proud city once stood, nightmarish creatures now wander the streets and mix with men in dens of corruption and squalor. It is therefore considered extremely virtuous for a knight to embark on a righteous crusade to Mordheim, seeking to achieve honour in battle and perhaps earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake. 

In Mordheim a knight’s courage and valour will be thoroughly tested, but so much the better, because with hardship comes honour. A Questing Knight will relinquish his castle and domain to set out on such a journey. He becomes free from any obligation to defend a domain and will now seek a road leading to new adventures. A Questing Knight has put all worldly ambitions aside and is accorded a rank far greater then even the most powerful dukes of the land. Such a gesture is considered particularly noble, and it is not uncommon for other knights and common folk to flock to the Questing Knight's aid. Knights Errant in particular are eager for adventure and a chance to win honour by a feat of arms, so will often join a Questing Knight on his journey. By the time the Questing Knight leaves the fair lands of Bretonnia he will have a sizable retinue following him, ready to fight for the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake.

Once on a quest a Knight will be spurred on by dreams and visions often visited upon him by the Lady of the Lake. This leads him ever onwards, inspiring and encouraging him on his quest. In time he hopes that through his deeds and valour he will earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake and she will let him drink from the Grail of Life. This is the final reward for a knight, and on finding the Grail he will return to Bretonnia to protect its people. Until that time though, he is bound to fight the enemies of virtue and order and to endure incalculable hardships.

### Special Rules

**Blessing of The Lady:** Bretonnian knights universally pray to the Lady of The Lake for her blessing, and her boons are often granted meritously to those of most chivalry. 

Before rolling for first turn the leader of a Bretonnian Crusade must take a Leadership test. If passed this blessing takes the form of a powerful curse upon the enemies of chivalry, in particular those who make use of cowardly weapons. Any warrior that attempts to shoot a Questing Knight or Knights Errant must roll a dice. On a 1-3 the shot is lost and they may take no further action.    
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.

### Heroes

#### **1 Questing Knight**
70 gold crowns to hire. 
_A Questing Knight is an extremely tough and virtuous individual, who fights to uphold the traditions of honour and to serve the Lady of the Lake. Injustice and the persecution of the weak are his enemies, whilst courage and valour are his companions. It is no wonder then that many a Questing Knight will journey to Mordheim._

##### Special Rules 
**Leader:** Any allied warrior within 6" of the Questing Knight may use his Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests. 
**Immune to Fear:** It takes a great deal to unnerve a Questing Knight - indeed they actively seek out the scary foes!

```
```
#### **0-2 Knights Errant**
35 gold crowns to hire  
_Knight Errant are the sons of nobles, eager to prove their mettle by feats of arms, and earn their place amongst the Knights of the Realm of Bretonnia. To do this they must perform valourous deeds, so they will often accompany a Questing Knight on his spiritual journey in the hope of adventure and honour._

#### 0-3 Squires
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Knights are served by their Squires, commoners who ride to the hunt with their master, and who accompany him to war. They are chosen from the fittest and youngest of a Knight’s retinue, and they are trained and schooled by the knight himself. If a squire performs some great deed or service to his master he may even be raised to the ranks of knighthood._

### Henchmen

#### Men-at-Arms
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Men-at-arms are the soldiery of Bretonnia. Every Knight maintains a retinue when he is a lord of a domain, and upon embarking on a quest, this retinue may join him on his journey. Men-at-arms are determined warriors, ready to fight for honour and justice as much as the Questing Knight they follow._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Men-at-Arms may choose equipment from the Men-at-Arms Equipment List.

#### Peasants
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Peasants are the workforce of Bretonnian industry, and live in bitter poverty while their lords watch over them from marble towers with barely tempered disgust. In spite of this they have an almost fanatical devotion to their masters, and Questing Knights often find themselves followed on campaign by an unbidden horde of Peasants, many of whom will have starved or died along the way hopelessly unprepared for the trip. While Knights will scoff and turn their noses up at these filth-ridden peasants they are not so foolish as to turn down the free help._
