# Lahmian Vampires
</div>

In ancient Nehekhara, women were forbidden from entering the priesthood and therefore forbidden from learning magic. This changed in the city of Lahmia under the rule of Queen Neferata, who created a sisterhood that enabled women to learn what was previously forbidden to them. Many were attracted to this sisterhood, even coming from the other cities to learn at Neferata’s feet. By forbidding women from learning magic, the priests of Nehekhara ultimately drove many of them to learning the darkest magic, the necromancy of Nagash. From the most promising of these pupils, Neferata chose those who would become her progeny, Vampires of unearthly beauty and arcane learning. 

Banished from their ancestral home after the necromantic schism of Nehekara, the Lahmians became experts in the arts of political infiltration through seduction - both of the body and mind. Of all the great vampire bloodlines, the Lahmians above all have become most adept at exploiting that great weakness of humanity, the desire for love, power and an escape from death. They have been hiding, often in plain sight, among the humans even since before the formation of the Empire, and through wit and guile have witnessed and manipulated the formation of nations to suit their mechanations. Consequentially many Lahmians are outrageously wealthy and hold seats in Court, a clandestine secret society that ever pulls the strings of government.

  Their poor, deluded followers do their bidding by night and protect them by day. Their interest in humanity (if interest is the right word to use of what are, after all, merely instruments and playthings) has made them strong. Lahmian warbands are more varied than another other vampiric bloodline due to this integration with human society, often needing to adjust their mannerisms just enough to avoid suspicion in their home province.

### Special Rules
**Blood Successor:** Should the Lahmian Vampire die the player may choose whether to immediately recruit a new one, or to begin the process of succession. This replaces the usual rules about Necromancers maintaining a warband, as the Blood Sister is capable of doing that herself. 

If a new Lahmian is hired then continue as normal, but if you choose succession then your Blood Sister prepares the final stages of her transformation as planned. Details are provided in the Blood Sister's special rules section later.

If the warband does not have a Blood Sister when the Lahmian dies you may immediately attempt to purchase one, who will then proceed with succession. If no Blood Sister can be bought then no Vampires remain within the warband either to sustain the undead or to maintain the enthrallment of The Beloved. The warband is lost.	
**Habituation:** Vampires' human servants rapidly have to become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Masters and their undead minions. The human members of a Lahmian Vampire warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in their own warband, i.e.: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.		
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic

### Choice of Warriors

A Lahmian warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 15, and you may not begin a campaign with more than five Heroes.	
**Lahmian Vampire:** A Lahmian warband must have one Lahmian Vampire – no more, no less!		
**Blood Sister:** Your warband may include up to one Blood Sister.	
**Beloved:** Your warband may include up to four Beloved.	
**Skeletons:** Your warband may include any number of Skeletons.	
**Dire Wolves:** Your warband may include up to five Dire Wolves.

### Starting Experience

**Lahmian Vampires** start with 20 experience.	
**Blood Sisters** start with 12 experience.	
**Beloved** start with varying experience. (Details below)	
**Henchmen** start with 0 experience.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ### Asp Bow
_The Asp Bow is a small, extremely lightweight weapon that closely resembles a Shortbow. The head of a viper crowns the nook from which its arrows are launched, magically infusing each shot with a powerful neurotoxin. So small and light are these bows that Lahmians are capable of firing off volleys at incredible speed, as well as concealling them within a petticoat._	
**Range:** 18"; **Strength:** 3	
>**Special Rules:** Multiple Shots (2). Poisoned Attacks.


<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


>### Serpent Whip
_As with the Asp Bow, the Serpent Whip is a conventional whip with a small barb at its tip. While whips are not typically lethal weapons they do break skin easily, allowing for excellent transmission of the poison within._	
**Range:** Hand-to-hand; **Strength:** As User.	
**Special Rules:** Whipcrack, Cannot be Parried, Poisoned Attacks.


### Heroes

#### **1 Lahmian Vampire**
110 gold crowns to hire.	
_Beautiful yet deadly, these seductive mistresses of undeath stalk the
halls of their long-lost homes, searching for who knows what?
Perhaps some far-off recollection of their long-vanished years
walking in the sunlight and the joy of life.._

___
##### Special Rules

**Immune to Psychology:** Lahmian Vampires have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.	
**Immune to Poison:** Lahmian Vampires are not affected by any poison.	
**No Pain:** Lahmian Vampires treat a  'stunned’ result on the Injury chart as ‘knocked down’.

\page
#### **0-1 Blood Sister**
50 gold crowns to hire	
_Lahmian vampires are solitary creatures, but the preservation of the bloodline is a priority for them. Young women are carefully selected and taught the Lahmian ways, as well as briefed on the vast array of intrigues and secrets that her predecessor has orchestrated in preparation for her succession. These women stand on the boundary of life and death. Not fully undead, but no longer wholly human either._

___

**Skills:** Blood Sisters may choose from Combat, Academic, Shooting, Strength, Speed, and Lahmian Special Skills.
___
##### Special Rules	
**Immune to Psychology:** Blood Sisters have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.		
**Demi-Vampires:** If the warband's Lahmian Vampire is killed, the Blood Sister may take her place. At her next advance she will become a vampire on a roll of 4+ on a d6. The Blood Sister retains her existing skills and experience but the usual rules for undead apply immediately. If the Blood Sister fails to transform, roll again at her next and all subsequent advances. Once a Blood Sister has become a vampire a new Blood Sister may be recruited into the warband after the next game.



#### 0-4 Beloved
Variable gold crowns to hire	
_Beloved are the hopelessly lovelorn, often through no error of their own. By combination of beguiling magics and conventional seduction these humans are the willful slaves of the Lahmian's will, often so unwilling to percieve fault in their Mistress that they will fail even to recognise fault in her commanding a warband of Necromancers and Skeletons._

	
##### Special Rules
**Recruitment & Stats:** The Beloved may be chosen from any hero in a human warband other then Middenheim, Witch Hunters, Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed, Carnival of Chaos and any hero that is either _Immune to Psychology_ or uses prayers. The Beloved will keep the same cost, profile, skill list, special rules and starting Experience. Weapons & Armour will be chosen from their Wargear list. If the Beloved had the _Leader_ skill they lose it.	
**Beloved:** If the Lahmian Vampire is _incapacitated_ or put Out of Action the Beloved will gain the _Frenzy_ special rule.
```

### Henchmen


#### Skeletons
20 gold crowns to hire	
_While Zombies are in abundant supply all over the Empire, and in some areas virtually indistinguishable from the peasantry and thus easily disguised, Lahmians are loathe to make use of them. The stench of rotting flesh does not wash out easily, and draws unnecessary attention at Court._

**Cause Fear:** Skeletons cause fear.	
**Immune to Psychology:** Skeletons have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.	
**Immune to Poison:** Skeletons are not affected by any poison.	
**No Pain:** Skeletons treat a ‘stunned’ result on the Injury chart as ‘knocked down’.	
**Slow:** Rattling and tireless, these undead constructs lack the agility of life. They may never run, though they may charge normally.	
**No Brain:** Skeletons are mindless automatons incapable of earning experience.


#### 0-5 Dire Wolves
25 gold crowns to hire	
_Dire Wolves are slavering Undead hounds, the animated remains of
the giant wolves of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Their chilling howls
can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors or most
ruthless Dwarf mercenaries. They prowl the streets of Mordheim
like shadows, and many men have died with the cold jaws of a Dire
Wolf around their neck._
