# Wood Elf Warbands
</div>

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

The Wood Elves, or Asrai as they are refer to themselves, are but one of the three Elven races. Like the others they too emerged from the cradle of the island paradise of Ulthuan, but unlike the other two the Asrai did so before the great schism that tore the race apart. For this reason, the Asrai hold themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, for only they embrace the whole of their nature. The folk of Athel Loren are unburdened by ritual sanctimony and therefore capable of great extremes of thought and deed. They are at once capricious and generous, malicious and caring, servants of both the dark and the light.

Elves are subtle creatures at heart, and live in the details of thought and deed that lesser creatures seldom notice. They live for intrigue and find joy in a clever tongue wielded by an accomplished mind. The speech of an Asrai is particularly incomprehensible to an outsider. This is not because the words themselves make little sense, but because there are always at least two possible interpretations of the intended meaning. In this way, a promise of assistance can sound disturbingly like a threat, and a death sentence like an offer of clemency. In this way does the speech of the Asrai reflect their complicated relationship with the world. Until backed up with deeds, words are just empty prophecies that speak to possible outcome; sometimes, even the Asrai do not know what they intend until the moment of action.

Taken together, an Elf's suppleness of mind and body ranks them amonst the deadliest of opponents. Though they may not be so hardy or so strong as the barbarians of the world, they know a finesse and precision that no such creature will ever grasp. An Elf sees every chink in their opponent's armour, every weakness of their guard. Moreover, they have the speed and skill to exploit these opportunities to land a killing strike before the foe has a chance to react. For an Asrai this is never truer than when they are armed with one of Athel Loren's famed longbows - they can place a shot through the visor of a charging knight from almost unbelievable distances.



### Forest Walker Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Forest Walker warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origins of your Forest Walker warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section.    
**Forest Walkers:** Elves are nowhere more at home than among trees. They never suffer movement penalties, or need to take Dangerous Terrain Tests if mounted, for being in a forest. Additionally, Elves in forests gain the _Stubborn_ rule.  
**Distrusts Elves:** Wood Elves have little issue with allying with factions that many others would deem unseemly, wholly confident in their ability to manipulate the lesser races and ultimately achieve their own aims. They are significantly more wary around their racial cousins however, and therefore may never form Formal Alliances with them.

## Forests of Athel Loren

Athel Loren is a place where few mortals have set foot. To even get to Athel Loren requires a journey through treacherous Deepwoods steeped in magic that alters the passage of time itself. It is a realm of forest spirits, of curses, of wonder, of life and death. The Elves that dwell here are the most isolationist of their kind, for dwelling within it can convince a mind that no universe exists outside its own. As a consequence their culture is also incredibly distinct, for no other faction of Asrai has attained as close a relationship with the forest spirits as they. 

They are the masters of craft, their cities woven into the trunks of trees and spanning out among the canopies in harmonious archetecture that grows along with the bark. Their robes are amongst the most distinctive, and they have develloped a technique known as Cold Metal forging, where metal is bent along and around durable lightweight roots to form an incredibly lightweight layer as practical for armour as it is for weaponry.

It takes a great deal to convince these Elves to emerge from their isolation. Beneath The Tree of Life, their most sacred place, vast roots known as The Worldroots spread out all across The Old World. It is a source of constant nourishment to the Skaven in particular, but with one of these roots sitting just below Mordheim the seeping corruption that eminates from the city has begun to be felt even in places as remote as Athel Loren.

##### Special Rules
**Forest Spirits:** No warbands are more attuned to the needs of the forests than those of Athel Loren. Consequentially the revenant-like spirits of spite and bark are more willing to co-operate with them. They may have any number of Dryads in their warband rather than the usual limit of 3. 
**Spiritual:** Athel Loren warbands employ great use of magic to enhance their expeditions and serve to keep them constantly connected to the forests even far from home. They may have up to two Spellsingers in the warband, rather than the usual limit of one.  
**Alignment:** The Warband’s Alignment is Lawful, or Lawful/Neutral.

## Forest of Shadows

The Forest of Shadows is one of the five largest forests located within the Empire's northern borders, mostly covering the territory of Ostland. Just like the neighboring forest of Drakwald, the Forest of Shadows is amongst the most dangerous places for Mankind's civilizations, for this region lies directly in the path of marauding armies of raiders heading south from the lands of the Far North. Due to its close proximity to the north this region of forest is heavily corrupted, and the Beastmen population is larger here than anywhere else in the Empire. The Ostlanders have suffered greatly as a result of these forests, the perpetual raiding by Beastmen and the forest's own often carniverous flora render much of the province unsuitable for agriculture. They are as a result the poorest of all Empire territories.

In spite of this hardship there are still Asrai dwelling there, for no race is better suited to coping with dangerous forests than they. The Forest of Shadows Elves have learned to treat the Beastmen invaders as a part of forest life, though one that they resent bitterly. Living in eternal stealth high up in the treetops, the Forest of Shadows Elves have learned to express their desire for artwork through their Wardancers - silent performers who spend their long lifetimes mastering a perfect balance between death and grace.

With Mordheim's corruption spreading throughout the southern bordering territory of Ostermark, many Asrai have become concerned at the increasing numbers of warbands migrating to visit it. They have observed from their vigils the Marauder, Cultist, and Beastmen warbands rampaging their way to the Cursed City in hopes of acquiring further blessings from their gods, and so the Forest of Shadows Elves venture out too in hopes of learning the cause of, and putting a stop to, the corruption.

##### Special Rules
**Beast-Hunters:** All Elves from the Forest of Shadows _hate_ all Beastmen.    
**Wardancers:** Forest of Shadows warbands may not purchase Waywatchers, but may now take up to three Wardancers.   
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Chaotic / Neutral.


## The Great Forest

The Great Forest, as its name suggests, is the largest forest in the Old World, and there is no Empire territory it does not touch. It is a truly continental place, and as a result its recesses can vary from vast spider lairs to human settlements untouched by the emergence of the Empire, still living small tribal subsistence lifestyles. It is perhaps remarkable then that on the whole The Great Forest is largely an uncorrupted place - be that due to its abundance of resources granting it far more attention from Empire loggers, or simply that a place of that scale could never be corrupted beyond repair by anything less than The End Times.

In either case its inhabitants strive to keep it clear of the dangerous influences of Beastmen, Forest Goblins, and monsters, driving them deeper into the dense blackness of the unbroken trees in the hope that they prey on eachother. These are places that humans do not dare to tread, for so thick are the trees and so dark is it made at all times by the solidly-packed canopy that it is very possible to bump into a mutant before you can even see them.

The Asrai of The Great Forest thrive in this darkness, and so well-hidden are they that their existence is largely considered a myth. They are the apex predators of the Forest, able to see in the most impossible of conditions - and more impressively still to track their arrows between the branches to cripple their quarry. They are enigmatic and mysterious in agenda, at once relentlessly tracking fleeing outlaws for miles in seeming delight at the terror they instil, at others guiding them back to safety at a whim.


##### Special Rules
**Predators:** Elves from The Great Forest may attempt Initiative tests to detect enemies from three times their Initiative value in inches, rather than the usual two. 
**Waywatchers:** The Great Forest warbands may not purchase Wardancers, but may now take up to three Waywatchers.   
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Chaotic / Neutral, or Chaotic.

### Heroes

#### **1 Glade Captain**
75 gold crowns to hire. 
_Young nobles are typically entrusted with warbands to give them practice of command and leadership before they are deemed ready for larger duties. "Young" is strictly a relative term however, as by any other standard these Captains are ancient and supernaturally skilled induviduals._

60 gold crowns to hire  
_While all Asrai are intrinsically magical beings, in truly gifted Elves this is shaped into a tool of great power. Spellsingers take great lengths to protect themselves from the corrupting forces of their magic, for even minor usage over the duration of their long lives can drive an Elf to madness, a lesson harshly learnt by the ruler Ariel._

### Henchmen

#### Glade Guard
35 Gold Crowns  
_The Glade Guard are the Asrai equivalent of a militia levy - though rather than unhappy and uninvested peasants serving under compulsion they are keen and eager warriors. They are potters and artists, husbands and wives - and they are all deadly with a bow._

```
### 0-3 Dryads
45 gold crowns to hire  
_The manifestation of the forests' vengeance, Dryads are furious spirits born of bark. While the darkest parts of mortal minds are what bring Daemons into this world, it is suggested that the Dryads are the darkest parts of the forests' conscience._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Dryads attack with razor-sharp claws fashioned from their limbs. They may never bear weapons or armour, but suffer no penalty for doing so.

##### Special Rules
**Forest Spirit:** Dryads are not entirely living creatures, and blows that would slay a mortal of similar constitution occasionally just cause splinters but nothing more. Dryads have a 6+ Ward Save. They also never gain experience.
**Flammable:** Being made of lightweight wood has its disadvantages. Dryads are _Flammable_.    
**Fear:** Characterised by a shrill, hollow, inhuman screams the Dryads are twisted beings that cause _fear_.
