#### Witch Hunters

The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as
the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the
eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers,
fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods,
deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of
profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting
music. Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the
suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception
of other Witch Hunters.
It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its
forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death
by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy.
Many of the Witch Hunters’ victims treacherously avoid their
fate by perishing under torture before making a full
confession. In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are
kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The
most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the
Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon
worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the
name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they
are the most abhorrent!
The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters
with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of
events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s
punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters
rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has
been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s
holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of
the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded the
Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the
wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also pits them
into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters
of Sigmar – those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-
heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty
of Sigmar.
Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon
turn a crowd to their own ends. They are universally dreaded,
for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are
countless individuals who would willingly and
enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a

Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch
Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens,
Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the
huge vicious war hounds which the Witch Hunters employ to
track and bring down fugitives.
As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-
armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and
headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly
curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them
of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so
that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.
The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that
accompany them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight
indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or
surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their
reason as well.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Zealots
20 gold crowns to hire
When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is
often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering
pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge
their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots.
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy
evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been
peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in
a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in
their ranks, and many a band of Zealots is led by Witch Hunters.

0-5 Flagellants
40 gold crowns to hire
Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the
world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the
ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane
persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire,
preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing
speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to
fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread.
Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat, for
they have the strength of madmen, and their bodies have become
inured to pain because of self-mutilation.

Weapons/Armor: Flagellants may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Flagellant Equipment

an Advance roll which would otherwise allow them to do so.
Special Rules
Fanatical: Flagellants are convinced that the end of the
world is nigh, and nothing in this world holds any terror for
them. Flagellants automatically pass all Leadership-based
tests they are required to take. A Flagellant may never
become a warband leader.
