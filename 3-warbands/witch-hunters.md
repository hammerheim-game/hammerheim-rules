# Witch Hunters
</div>

The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers, fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods, deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting music. Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception of other Witch Hunters.

It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy. Many of the Witch Hunters’ victims treacherously avoid their fate by perishing under torture before making a full confession. 

In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they are the most abhorrent!

The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded the Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also pits them into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters of Sigmar – those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty of Sigmar.

Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon turn a crowd to their own ends. They are universally dreaded, for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are countless individuals who would willingly and enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens, Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the huge vicious war hounds which the Witch Hunters employ to track and bring down fugitives.

As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.

The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that accompany them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their reason as well.
 
 
 
 
### Special Rules
**Witch Trials:** Witch Hunter warbands may never sell into slavery or ransom any captured warrior who; bears a Mark of Chaos, is a Magic User, or is either Undead, Possessed, or Daemonic.

These captives are instead put on trial, though funnily enough there are no recorded instances of Witch Hunters ever finding an accused innocent. Captives placed on trial are very publicly tortured until they atone for their sins, and are ultimately destroyed and removed from the owning player's roster, granting +2 experience to the Witch Hunters' warband leader and +50 gold crowns as a bounty reward from the Grand Theogonist's coffers.	

Additionally your warband leader must always be either a Witch Hunter or a Warrior-Priest.	
**Angry Mob:** The fervent followers that typically accompany Witch Hunters already slavishly hang from their every word, to them a Witch Hunter's judgement is that of Sigmar himself. They are rarely the most stable of induviduals, and their unthinking passion is one that the charismatic Witch Hunters have learned to harness. Any good Witch Hunter leader knows exactly how to deliver a speech to incite a zealous mob into a riotous rage, often by empowering them such as declaring them the instruments of Sigmar's will.

Once per battle at the start of your Recovery Phase your warband leader, as long as they are a Witch Hunter of some sort, may attempt to rouse their rabble into a pious fury. The Witch Hunter must take a Leadership test. If passed then for the duration of your turn all Zealots and Flagellants within 6" gain the _Frenzy_ special rule. If failed nothing happens and they may not attempt a speech again until next game.	
**Alignment:** The Warband's Alignment is Lawful.

### Henchmen


#### 0-5 Flagellants
45 gold crowns to hire	
_Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire, preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread. Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat, for they have the strength of madmen, and their bodies have become inured to pain because of self-mutilation._

```
```
#### Zealots
15 gold crowns to hire	
_When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is
often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering
pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge
their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots.
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy
evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been
peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in
a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in
their ranks, and many a band of Zealots is led by Witch Hunters._
