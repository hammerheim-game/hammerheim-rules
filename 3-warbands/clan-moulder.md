# Clan Moulder
</div>

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

To the north, in the blasted wasteland known as the Troll Country, lie the infernal breeding pits of Clan Moulder. Their stronghold is burrowed into the walls and floor of a ragged chasm in a snowy mountainside in the northern spur of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Volcanic pools at the bottom of the chasm raise a greyish plume of steam and vapours over it and mix the stink of sulphur with the stench of matted fur and excrement carried on the wind. 

Worse than the stench is the dreadful cacophony of howls, squawks, screams, snarls and shrieks which clamour out of the frozen chasm like the wailing, lost souls of a thousand different races. It is not without good reason that this place is known as the Hell Pit. Clan Moulder is constantly seeking new, stable breeds of fighting beasts that they can sell or hire to the other clans. 

Small bands of Packmasters scour the lands around Hell Pit for creatures to capture for their diabolic experimentation. Chaos monsters from the Northern Wastes are the most dangerous but also the most valuable by far. Huge and monstrous creatures always offer the best chance to create a new breed of fighting beasts. Clan Moulder hunters will trail a Manticore or Hydra for months waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Captured beasts are hauled away into Hell Pit in great iron cages. Once in the pit they are exposed to Warpstone, a refined version of Wyrdstone, and fed on carefully measured amounts of it until the desired mutations start to form. Rumours abound of the crossbred monstrosities they have created of which the fearsome Rat Ogre is undoubtedly the most infamous. Rat- like wolves have also been seen prowling in Kislev, along with curious furred breeds of troll and huge, seldom-seen burrowing creatures.

Some of the beasts the Packmasters catch are simply trained and sold to other clans. Clan Moulder Packmasters are experts in training wild and vicious monsters. Truculent beasts are broken into obedience and passive creatures goaded until they become killers. The bottom of Hell Pit is filled with the detritus of the clan's failed experiments: pale twisted monstrosities that shamble or  flop across the floor of the chasm and feed on one another. With the exception of Clan Skryre it is Moulder who have the most volatile experimentations and knowledge of Wyrdstone.

No creature better encapsulates the cruel genius of Moulder than the Rat Ogres. Vast mutated mountains of hateful muscle, these enormous creatures possess the strength of an Ogre with the jittery speed and aggression of a Wolf Rat. Demand from other Clans for these creatures is unending, for there are few creatures in the Old World that are capable of withstanding their ferocity.

### Heroes

#### **1 Master Moulder**
70 gold crowns to hire. 
_The Master Moulder's task is not just the acquisition of Wyrdstone but also the study and capture of any creature they encounter whose mutations are deemed desireable. Mordheim therefore presents a wealth of opportunities, for the mutagenic effects of Wyrdstone have had a profound effect on its remaining inhabitants._

#### 0-5 Wolf Rats
15 gold crowns to hire  
_Though Clan Moulder often claim to create rats the size of wolves, it is rare indeed for them to supply other clans with the largest and strongest of this relatively stable breed. Wolf Rats are canines mutated by Clan Moulder into hunting beasts. They combine the cunning of a rat with the ferocity and brute strength of a canine. The Wolf Rats are the same size and build as a wolf but with hairless legs that end in rat -ike claws, a rat's head and a rat tail. In addition they often have hideous mutations such as an extra head, abnormal bone growth or insect like tails. They are kept in spiked cages and fed on their own dead, so that when they are finally unleashed into the outside world they attack anything in their path in a blood rage._
