#### Clan Moulder

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander
To the north, in the blasted wasteland known as the Troll
Country, lie the infernal breeding pits of Clan Moulder. Their
stronghold is burrowed into the walls and floor of a ragged
chasm in a snowy mountainside in the northern spur of the
Worlds Edge Mountains. Volcanic pools at the bottom of the
chasm raise a greyish plume of steam and vapours over it and
mix the stink of sulphur with the stench of matted fur and
excrement carried on the wind. Worse than the stench is the
dreadful cacophony of howls, squawks, screams, snarls and
shrieks which clamour out of the frozen chasm like the
wailing, lost souls of a thousand different races. It is not
without good reason that this place is known as the Hell Pit.
Clan Moulder is constantly seeking new, stable breeds of
fighting beasts that they can sell or hire to the other clans.
Small bands of Packmasters scour the lands around Hell Pit
for creatures to capture for their diabolic experimentation.
Chaos monsters from the Northern Wastes are the most
dangerous but also the most valuable by far. Huge and
monstrous creatures always offer the best chance to create a
new breed of fighting beasts. Clan Moulder hunters will trail
a Manticore or Hydra for months waiting for an opportunity
to strike. Captured beasts are hauled away into Hell Pit in
great iron cages. Once in the pit they are exposed to
Warpstone and fed on carefully measured amounts of it until
the desired mutations start to form. Rumours abound of the
crossbred monstrosities they have created of which the
fearsome Rat Ogre is undoubtedly the most infamous. Rat-
like wolves have also been seen prowling in Kislev, along
with curious furred breeds of troll and huge, seldom-seen
burrowing creatures. Some of the beasts the Packmasters
catch are simply trained and sold to other clans. Clan
Moulder Packmasters are experts in training wild and vicious
monsters. Truculent beasts are broken so that they obey and
passive creatures goaded until they become killers. The
bottom of Hell Pit is filled with the detritus of the clan's
failed experiments: pale twisted monstrosities that shamble or

flop across the floor of the chasm and feed on one another.
Clan Moulder is the clan with the most experience and
knowledge about the effects of Warpstone, possible with the
exception of the Order of Grey Seers.

0-5 Wolf Rats
55 gold crowns to hire
Though Clan Moulder often claim to create rats the size of
wolves, it is rare indeed for them to supple other clan with the
largest and strongest of this relatively stable breed. Wolf Rats
are canines mutated by Clan Moulder into hunting beasts,
they combine the cunning of a rat with the ferocity and brute
strength of a canine. The Wolf Rats are the same size and
build as a wolf but with hairless legs that end in rat like
claws, a rat's head and a rat tail. In addition they often have
hideous mutations such as an extra head, abnormal bone
growth or insect like tails. Those that truly lupines are kept in
spiked cages and fed on their own dead, so that when they are
finally unleashed into the outside world they attack anything
in their path in a blood rage.
