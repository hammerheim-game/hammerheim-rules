#### Black Orc Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Smarter, stronger, more vicious and better equipped than the
normal Orc (and that’s saying something when you’re talking
about Orcs), Black Orcs are amongst some of the worst foes
anyone can face in single combat...and a band of them is
certainly something to put the fear into the hearts of men!
They do appear more built than born and it is little wonder
that there are many rumours regarding their origins.
Since the Storm of Chaos there are many, many more of
these monsters now wandering the Empire, having followed
Grimgor Ironhide in his Waaagh! Where once the forces of
the Empire could have tracked down warbands of these
creatures in a matter of weeks, now there is no means or
enough men to perform such a task and thus the Black Orcs
roam freely.
What aims do the Black Orcs have? What is the point of a
tornado? It is meaningless to ponder such matters because all
the Orcs want is to fight and that means attacking whomever
crosses their path. What they gain from such battling is not
completely understood, but it seems to be nothing more
complicated than the chance to fight. There is no logic from
them nor can any be expected.

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In

any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.
2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Let the goons do the work: Black Orcs rely on themselves
to do the killing and do not ride mounts of any kind. Only
normal Orcs may ride a boar or other such mount.
Da Boss is Dead!: If the Boss should be killed a Black Orc
will always assume leadership of the warband before any
other type, irrespective of relative experience. The
replacement will automatically acquire the "Oi Behave!"
skill.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Black Orc warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns with which you can use
to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.
Black Orc Boss: Each Black Orc warband must have one
Black Orc Boss.
Black Orcs: Your warband may include up to 2 Black Orcs
Young’uns: Your warband can include up to 2 Young’uns.
Orc Boys: Any number of models may be Orc Boys
Orc Shootaz: May only have as many Shootaz as the
warband has Boyz.
Savage Orcs: Your warband may include up to 4 Savage
Orcs
Troll: You may include a single Troll in the warband.
##### Starting experience

A Black Orc Boss starts with 20 experience.
Black Orcs start with 8 experience
Young’uns and All Henchmen start with 0 experience

##### Heroes

1 Black Orc Boss
90 gold crowns to hire
Amongst some of the toughest of the tough, a Black Orc Boss has
fought in numerous battles and proven to the gods just how truly
powerful they can become. Taking a warband is the start of their
ambitions as they will seek victories to meld the Boyz into larger
and larger warbands until they have a Horde at their beck and call.

Weapons/Armor: A Black Orc Boss may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Black Orc equipment
list.
Skills: The Black Orc Boss may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Strength & Speed when he gains a new skill. In
addition, the Black Orc Boss may choose from the Orc
Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Boss may use his
Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.
Black Orc: Model starts with a natural 6+ Armor Save.
This save may be combined with other equipment to improve
it.
Oi Behave!: If any Henchman fails his Animosity test within
6” of the Boss, the player may opt to have the boss stamp his
authority (and clenched fist) on the situation.
The misbehaving Henchman will receive an automatic hit at
the strength of the Orc player’s choosing. If the Henchman is
still on his feet after his slap, he may add a number equal to
the strength of the slap to his subsequent roll to determine the
effects of Animosity.
e.g. The player decides that the Boss will hit a misbehaving
Henchman with a S2 slap. If the slap fails to Knock Down,
Stun or Out of Action the Henchman, then he adds +2 to the
Animosity Effect roll.

0-2 Black Orc
60 gold crowns to hire
In it for the mayhem and maybe a little loyalty to the Boss of the
warband, these Black Orcs lead the charge at every turn, knowing
that killing is only at arm’s reach all the time and they don’t care
what the target is. Whether it is some Imperial peasant, a herd of
Beastmen or even the Boyz in the warband, the Black Orcs just
don’t care as long as they get to crump something!

Black Orc: Model starts with a 6+ Armor Save. This may
be improved upon by other equipment.
0-2 Young’uns
25 gold crowns to hire
Keen eager and, above all, green recruits to any warband, these
lads haven’t seen anywhere near as much action as the others in the
warband and they’re plenty keen to get in there and do some
damage. Of course one day, they know it’ll be their warband.

Special Rules
Black Orc Blood: One Young’un may be upgraded to a
Black Orc Young’un for 10GCs. This upgrade allows him to
take the ‘Proven Warrior’ skill upgrade, thus making him a
fully fledged Black Orc Warrior.


##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Orc Boyz
25 gold crowns to hire
No warband would be complete without the warm bodies to makeup
the number and thus the Boyz are essential, purely because the
Black Orcs need someone to kick around when they can’t find
anything else to do it too.

list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Orc Boyz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).

0-1 Troll
200 gold crowns to hire
Trolls are not intelligent enough to recognize the value of gold, but
large amounts of food can often instill a certain loyalty in them.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armor: Trolls do not require weapons to fight
but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If this fee is not paid the Troll gets
hungry and wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armor saves.

Orc Shootaz
25 gold crowns to hire
Not all Orcs enjoy getting into a fight straight away. Some are
hunters, tracking prey and shooting it down from a distance; others
recognise that sometimes you need to soften up a really tough foe
from a distance before moving in to finish them off. This is the
closest Orcs come to outright cowardice.

Weapons/Armor: Shootaz may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Henchmen equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Shootaz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).
Uncommon: A warband may not hire more Shootaz than
they have Boyz. If a boy dies and the Shootaz outnumber the
Boyz, the next hire must be a boy so that the balance is
restored.
 
0-4 Savage Orcs
40 gold crowns to hire
Savage Orcs persist in their primitive ways to this day. Even by
Orcish standards, they are a complete bunch of primitives. They use
mostly stone or bone weapons and go around half-naked, or worse.
Many live in their own tribes and have their own ways of fighting
that make them easily distinguishable.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |4 3 2 3 4 1 2 2 5
Weapons/Armor: A Savage Orc may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Henchmen equipment
list.
Special Rules
Unstable: These Orcs are not quite all there. They do not
suffer from Animosity but instead have a host of their own
issues to deal with.
Crazy: Savage Orcs always pass any Leadership-based Tests
they have to take. A side effect of this is that their primitive
minds and they may never learn Academic Skills should they
become a Hero on an Advance Roll.
Savage: Savage Orcs are subject to Frenzy as detailed in the
Psychology section of the Mordheim rulebook. They must
always run or charge towards the nearest opponent they can
see. If no enemy is visible they are moved under the player’s
control. They can never use any form of armor or ranged
weapons. Savage Orcs are also so primitive for other Boyz
and can never have the Leader ability or use their Ld stat for
rout tests, unless they are the only models from the warband
left on the board.


#### Forest Goblin Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Forest Goblin tribes dwell deep within The Great Forest. They have completely adapted to their surroundings, learning stealth
and camouflage to evade their neighbours.
Gold motivates the Forest Goblins as it does any warband, albeit for different reasons. It is worthless to them as currency but
as a metallic resource, it is valuable nonetheless. Instead of using gold to buy weapons and armor, Forest Goblins actually
coat their stone equipment with the metal. This has led unscrupulous leaders to send their henchmen into certain ambush, only
to arrive later to collect the arrowheads and spear points from the remains of their former employees
Forest Goblins are able to create poisons with a precision surpassing even the Dark Elves. Their natural surroundings
harbour any number of poisonous creatures, including the gigantic spiders they are rumoured to prod into combat with their
enemies. Coating their weapons with deadly venom, the Goblins are capable of felling any foe, no matter their size. Led by
their Chieftain (usually the Goblin with the loudest voice), the Forest Goblins appear from nowhere and strike with feral
ferocity before receding into the trees, leaving injuries as the only proof they were ever there.

##### Special Rules

Natives: Used to poking through the underbrush, Forest
Goblins suffer no movement penalties from moving through
any wooded terrain.
Animosity: Goblins enjoy nothing more than a good scrap,
unfortunately they’re not always very discerning about who
they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of the Goblin
player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is either an
Orc or Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior has taken
offense to something one of his mates has done or said. Do
not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat
(they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how offended
the model is, roll another D6 and consult the following chart
to see what happens:
D6 Result
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc

combat against the source of his ire. At the end of this

Henchmen or Hired Swords within charge reach, and the
warrior is armed with a missile weapon, he immediately

Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above applies,

in hand-to-hand combat.

sight, the Goblin may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a
single turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Goblin
within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior must
charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Giant Spider Mount: If you are using the optional rules for
mounts, then your warband’s heroes may ride giant spiders.
The rider’s armor save increased by +1, exactly as if mounted
on an ordinary horse. The rider need not dismount to climb
terrain (including building exteriors) and the spider’s natural
climbing abilities allow the rider to re-roll any failed
climbing attempts. The Giant Spider count as Rare 5 and
Cost 45Gold Crown for Forest Goblins Mobs.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Forest Goblin warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 20.
Chieftain: Each Forest Goblin warband must have one
Chieftain.
Braves: Your warband may include up to four Braves.
Shaman: Your warband may include one Shaman, but he can
only be taken instead of a Brave.
Forest Goblins: Any number of models may be Forest
Goblins.
Red Toof Boyz: Your warband may include up to five Red
Toof Boyz.
Sluggas: Your warband may include up to five Sluggas.
Gigantic Spider: Your warband may include one Gigantic
Spider.

Toof Boyz are affected by the rules for Frenzy as described in
the Mordheim rulebook. In addition, if they begin their turn
within charge range of an enemy, they are immune to
animosity for that turn.

0-5 Sluggas

0-1 Gigantic Spider
200 gold crowns to hire
Gigantic Spiders are best avoided when encountered in the wild,
due to their deadly poison and huge size. When urged into fighting
by Forest Goblin beastmasters, they become doubly dangerous and
much harder to evade.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |6 3 0 5 5 3 4 2 4
Weapons/Armor: A Gigantic Spider never needs or uses
weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Gigantic Spiders cause fear as described in the
Mordheim Rulebook.
Large Monster: Gigantic Spiders are large targets, and may
always be shot at regardless if they are closest or not.
Poisonous: The Gigantic Spider’s maw drips with vile
poisons. When it wounds an enemy and a roll is made on the
injury table, 1= knocked down, 2-4= stunned, and 5-6= Out
of Action.
Native: Negotiating woodlands is no trouble for spiders.
They move through any wooded terrain without penalty.
Non-sentient: Spiders are affected by the stupidity rules in
the Mordheim rulebook. In addition, they never gain
experience, as they are animals. Note however that they may
climb as normal.
May Ride: The Forest Goblin Chieftain, may ride the
Gigantic Spider, if you are using the optional rules for
mounts. The chieftain gains +1 armor save, and shall move
at the Gigantic Spider’s rate of 6. Shooting attacks hit the
Chieftain on a die roll of 1-2, and the Gigantic Spider on a 3-
6. In close combat, the opponent may choose which to hit.
The Gigantic Spider no longer has to check for stupidity if it
is being ridden, as the Chieftain is directing its actions.
