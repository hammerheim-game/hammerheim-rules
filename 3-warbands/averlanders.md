#### Averlander

Averland lies in the south of the Empire, between the rivers
Aver and Upper Reik and borders upon the Black Mountains
and the huge range that is the Worlds Edge Mountains. It’s a
prosperous province, though it’s neither one of the largest or
most influential in the Empire. The Black Mountains and the
World Edge Mountains harbour plenty of mines, many are in
Dwarf possession. The metal ore is sold at a good profit in
Averheim, the provincial capital, to merchants from Nuln,
who transport it on barges down the river Aver. The
mountains contain several ancient Dwarf strongholds but
Night Goblins or Skaven has overrun several of them, while
others have been lost in violent volcanic eruptions.
The Black Fire Pass guards an important trade route between
the Borderlands and the Empire; it divides the World Edge
Mountains from the Black Mountains. The route is an old
Dwarf road and extends past Averheim and further north into
the Empire. Goods from the Black Fire pass are usually
shipped along the Aver River to Nuln. The pass is the only
place to cross the mountains, as the mountainsides are
extremely steep and almost impossible to pass. Not to
mention that the weather is notoriously unpredictable and few
dare risk being caught in a snow blizzard or avalanche. As if
things weren’t bad enough the mountains are home to fierce
tribes of Night Goblins, Trolls, Skaven and legendary
monsters. Some daring adventurers have made a living off
stealing eggs from the tallest peaks and selling them to the
Imperial Zoo. These beasts will be brought up to become
mounts for famous generals.
Averland is a rich province and as a result exorbitant sums of
money are spent on the uniforms of the state soldiers.
Seasoned veterans prefer flamboyant uniforms to make them
stand out compared to the peasant, but also to reflect their
seniority. This tradition has seeped down through the ranks to
a point where even the militia and mercenary bands strive to
have as flamboyant clothing as they can afford. The
Averlander army is said to employ enough tailors to supply a
small city! Outsiders joke that the Averlanders are such great
archers because they do not want to get up close and personal
as they risk tearing or bloodying their clothes. Such remarks
are hushed down in the presence of a veteran of the Black
Fire Pass though, or else the jester will soon find himself in
the gutter with a few missing teeth. The practice of wearing
outrageous clothing has certainly appealed to the diminutive
race of Halflings and tailors are constantly being asked to
shorten sleeves and add a little extra width to the waist. Many

Young recruits are disheartened to learn that they are
disallowed from wearing the stunning uniform until they
have served at least a year in the army. These ‘Youngbloods’
are by no means regarded as professional soldiers yet and
have to make do with more simple clothing.
The Bergjaeger are a special detachment of the Black Fire
Pass guard that is made up of trappers and rangers from the
surrounding mountains. They are experts at moving silently
through rocky terrain and are often used as scouts. The
background of a ranger is as varied as there are rangers, and
most of them have a story to tell. Some were gamekeepers
who have lost their job or found it too uninspiring.
Somewhere poachers press-ganged into the army to avoid
serving prison time. Some might have been rustlers who
decided to flee to the militia when the angry farmers came
too close to catching him. Whatever their background they
are expert marksmen and well suited to a life in the bleak
mountain wilderness.

##### Heroes

1 Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
The Captain of a mercenary warband is typically a middle-aged
veteran soldier of the Imperial army, most likely he was a sergeant
or other petty officer. The survival of a mercenary warband relies
more on the wit and experience of its captain, than on how good a
fighter he is. It’s all too common that an inexperienced captain will
lead his men into an ambush, or lead them on a long journey with
no food or supplies. Being a successful captain means that your men
will follow you to hell and back, and plenty of gold crowns and
feasting. A captain that fails in his duty to keep his men alive and
well fed will at best find himself deserted and worst end up with a
knife in his back.

0-1 Sergeant
35 gold crowns to hire
Some captains are merchants or nobles that are looking for a
chance at making some extra money. The brighter captains hire the
service of a veteran as his sergeant, and leave all the practical
decision to him. A veteran can be recognised by his many battle-
scars and the cynicism that marks a soldier of the army.

0-2 Bergjaeger
35 gold crowns to hire
The Bergjaeger are trappers and rangers from the mountains that
surround the Black Fire pass. They are experts at moving silently
through terrain and are used as scouts. In addition they make good
use of animal traps to delay or divide a group of enemies.
Bergjaeger are not professional soldiers and rely more on stealth
and cunning than a strong sword-arm to survive.

Special Rules
Set Traps: Bergjaeger are expert trappers and hunters and
these skills can be put to great use in the ruins of Mordheim.
A Bergjaeger may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing
else (he may not set traps if he’s just recovered from being
Knocked Down). Place a marker in base contact with the
Bergjaeger. When a model, friend or foe, moves within 2" of
the marker he risks setting off the trap – roll a D6. On a score
of 3+ he has triggered the trap and suffers a S4 hit (note that
the Bergjaeger won’t trigger his own traps). If the trap did not
wound the model or it didn’t trigger, the ‘victim’ may finish
his move otherwise he is placed knocked Down or Stunned
2" from the marker. Regardless whether the trap was
triggered or not, the marker is removed.

0-1 Youngblood
15 gold crowns to hire
Although Empire armies are comprised of mature men there are
plenty of jobs for youths as there is always a demand for extra help
in the kitchens or as fetchers. Some of these youths actually join a
band of mercenaries or regiment in pursuit of a romantic dream of
fame and adventure. Some are herdsmen who hoped to find an
easier way of filling their belly than the hard and uncertain business
of looking after animals, not to mention that its quite dull!

##### Henchman

(Brought in groups of 1-5)
Mountainguard
30 gold crowns to hire
The Mountainguard is the famous garrison of the Black Fire Pass
that has repelled countless greenskin invasion attempts. Their
traditional uniform is yellow and black and it’s a merit in the
Averland army to have served a few years at the mountain-pass. The
Mountain guard train both with the traditional Imperial weapons,
the halberd and the sword, and with the crossbow and bow.
Veterans are often employed by mercenary warbands who know that
their presence will certainly boost their chances in the battles to
come. Some of these veterans advance to become sergeants or even
captains themselves. There are a few warbands that consists solely
of Mountainguard veterans, often from the same regiment or the
survivors of a great battle.

Marksmen
25 gold crowns to hire
Being a Marksmen is not as simple as picking up a bow and try to
hit your enemies. A Marksman has to train for years to master his
chosen weapon, Imperial enlisters often visit archery competitions
to try and enlist a couple of expert archers. Some Marksmen are
trained with black powder weapons instead of the traditional bow or
crossbow. Marksmen often own their own weapons, as the cost of a
handgun is as high as hiring the Marksman himself! Thus the
Marksmen are not forced to do as much hard labour as the militia.

0-3 Halflings Scouts

the Orc Warlord Gorbad Ironclaw invaded through the Black Fire
pass and the Moot was devastated. Ever since then the Moot urge
their gamekeepers to serve at least a few years in the garrison that
guard the pass. If another warlord tries to invade the Moot, they will
meet the fierce resistance of the Halflings in the mountain Pass.
