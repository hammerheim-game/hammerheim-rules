##### Heroes

1 Blood Dragon Knight
110 gold crowns to hire
Vampires of the Blood dragons are all descendants of Abhorash and
belong to the most capable warriors in the Old World. They use
their Vampiric abilities to become superior fighters, always seeking
new challenges. Most of them are members of the Order of the
Dragon-Templars, an ancient knightly order based in the Empire or
other unholy Orders. Unlike their von Carstein cousins, they have
not much love for Magic and intrigues. They prefer using their
combat abilities rather than using dark magic.

80 gold crowns to hire
Wights are long dead heroes who are tied to the land of the living by
magic. In ages past, the men of the Old World buried their dead
beneath mounds of earth and stone, together with their battle gear
and worldly wealth. Although their bodies have decayed, Wights are
held together by evil magic so strong that it can last for many
centuries. They wear ancient armour of bronze and black iron,
corroded by time and dusty with the years. They carry iron weapons
inlaid with evil runes, an accursed parody of once powerful magical
blades. Some Vampires rule over entire regiments of Wights,
warriors who dared challenge them in life and now serve them in
death.

Bondsmen are loyal to death to their undead master.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Skeleton Warriors
20 gold crowns to hire
The battlefields of the Old World are strewn with the graves of many
nameless warriors who have fallen in combat and been consigned to
a hasty resting place, or left upon the ground amidst the carnage.
Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be
summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that
these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint
memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the
compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they
were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is
confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid
when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching
towards him?

0-5 Grave Guard
35 gold crowns to hire
