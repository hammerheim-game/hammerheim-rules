# Blood Dragon Knights
</div>

The Blood Dragons are the least numerous of the five major vampiric bloodlines in the Old World. While the heart of vampirism beats in Sylvania to the east of the Empire, the Blood Dragons are most populous in Mousillon on the western coast of Brettonia where the culture of fully-masked helmetted knights, duelling, and mingling of bloodlines has enabled them to take a firm foothold. It speaks volumes to the power, influence, and wealth of the Blood Dragons that in spite of this vast distance they are still considered a key player in Sylvanian politics.

These Vampires are one of the most well disguised in the Old World for, within Brettonia at least, they can easily hide among knightly orders or distant outposts, feeding on those they can to avoid detection while using their disguise and opportunities for battle to test their skills and push themselves. Blood Dragons live only for combat, the attainment of honour, and the thrill of battle - a dark parody of the virtue of mortal knights.

The founding father of the Blood Dragons was a knight named Abhorash, and their namesake comes from his descovery that slaying a dragon and drinking their blood directly, while not curing their vampirism, permanently removes the need to constantly drink human blood to sustain themselves. It is therefore the goal of every Blood Dragon to hone their skills and gather their strength to one day hunt one of these beasts.

With this goal being their sole objective, Blood Dragons are a surprisingly diverse group. While some are merciless combatants with an open hatred of all living things, others maintain some degree of honour - readily freeing captives or sparing defeated opponents depending on their own personal values. One trait they almost universally share however is a distain for magic: Necromancy is a means to an end for Blood Dragons, and they have few interests or agenda beyond martial perfection.

### Special Rules

**Habituation:** Vampires' human servants rapidly have to become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Masters and their undead minions. The human members of an Blood Dragon Knight warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in their own warband, i.e.: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.	
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic

### Heroes

#### **1 Blood Dragon Knight**
120 gold crowns to hire.	
_Vampires of the Blood dragons are all descendants of Abhorash and belong to the most capable warriors in the Old World. They use
their Vampiric abilities to become superior fighters, always seeking new challenges. Most of them are members of the Order of the Dragon-Templars, an ancient knightly order based in the Empire or other unholy Orders. Unlike their von Carstein cousins, they have not much love for Magic and intrigues. They prefer using their combat abilities rather than using dark magic._

#### **0-2 Wights**
70 gold crowns to hire
_Wights are long dead heroes who are tied to the land of the living by magic. In ages past, the men of the Old World buried their dead beneath mounds of earth and stone, together with their battle gear and worldly wealth. Although their bodies have decayed, Wights are held together by evil magic so strong that it can last for many centuries. They wear ancient armour of bronze and black iron, corroded by time and dusty with the years. They carry iron weapons inlaid with evil runes, an accursed parody of once powerful magical blades. Some Vampires rule over entire regiments of Wights, warriors who dared challenge them in life and now serve them in death._

Although they are not really evil, they often have an unimaginable hate for human society. Vampires use them as servants and as they treat them very well, the Bondsmen are loyal to death to their undead master._

### Henchmen











#### Skeleton Warriors
20 gold crowns to hire	
_The battlefields of the Old World are strewn with the graves of many nameless warriors who have fallen in combat and been consigned to a hasty resting place, or left upon the ground amidst the carnage. Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching towards him?_
