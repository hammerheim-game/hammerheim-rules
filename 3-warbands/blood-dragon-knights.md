# Blood Dragon Knights
</div>

The Blood Dragons are the least numerous of the five major vampiric bloodlines in the Old World. While the heart of vampirism beats in Sylvania to the east of the Empire, the Blood Dragons are most populous in Mousillon on the western coast of Brettonia where they have managed to skillfully exploit the feudal system to become a dynasty of lords. It speaks volumes to the power, influence, and wealth of the Blood Dragons that in spite of this vast distance they are still considered a key player in Sylvanian politics.


The founding father of the Blood Dragons was a knight named Abhorash, and their title comes from his discovery that slaying a dragon and drinking their blood directly, while not curing their vampirism, permanently removes the need to constantly drink human blood to sustain themselves. It is therefore the goal of every Blood Dragon to hone their skills and gather their strength to one day hunt one of these beasts. There is no skill these vampires respect greater than martial prowess, indeed tales tell of Blood Dragons assisting young Knights in their ascension to join the legendary Grail Knights only that they might have a worthy foe to test their skills against later on.

Blood Dragons are a surprisingly diverse group. While some are merciless combatants with an open hatred of all living things, others maintain some degree of honour, readily freeing captives or sparing defeated opponents depending on their own personal values. One trait they almost universally share however is a distain for magic: Necromancy is a means to an end for Blood Dragons, and they have few interests or agenda beyond martial perfection.

### Special Rules

**Habituation:** Vampires' human servants rapidly have to become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Masters and their undead minions. The human members of an Blood Dragon Knight warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in their own warband, i.e. skeletons, wights, vampires, etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.  
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral/Chaotic
**Immortal Horror:** Such is the resilience of the Blood Dragons that it takes utter annihilation to truly kill them. Blood Dragon Vampires that roll the "Dead" result on Serious Injury instead miss D3+1 games.
```

**Blood Dragon Knight:** A Blood Dragon warband must have one Blood Dragon Knight – no more, no less!

### Heroes

#### **1 Blood Dragon Knight**
120 gold crowns to hire.    
_Vampires of the Blood Dragon line are all descendants of Abhorash and are among the most capable warriors in the Old World. They use
their Vampiric abilities to become superior fighters, always seeking new challenges. Most of them are members of the Order of the Dragon-Templars, an ancient knightly order based in Bretonnia or other unholy Orders. Unlike their von Carstein cousins, they have not much love for Magic and intrigues. They prefer using their combat abilities rather than using dark magic._

#### **0-2 Wights**
70 gold crowns to hire  
_Wights are long dead heroes who are tied to the land of the living by magic. In ages past, the men of the Old World buried their dead beneath mounds of earth and stone, together with their battle gear and worldly wealth. Although their bodies have decayed, Wights are held together by evil magic so strong that it can last for many centuries. They wear ancient armour of bronze and black iron, corroded by time and dusty with the years and carry iron weapons inlaid with evil runes, an accursed parody of once powerful magical blades. Some Vampires rule over entire regiments of Wights, warriors who dared challenge them in life and now serve them in death._

##### Special Rules

**Cause Fear:** Wights are terrifying Undead creatures and therefore cause fear.    
**Immune to Psychology:** Wights have the _Immune to Psychology_ special rule.  
**Immune to Poison:** Wights are not affected by any poison.

#### 0-3 Bondsmen
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Bondsmen are pitiable beings, who are somehow in debt to their undead master. Often they are crippled hunchbacks, outcasts of society because of their strange appearance. Although they are not really evil, they often have an unimaginable hate for human society. Vampires use them as servants and as they treat them very well, the Bondsmen are loyal to death to their undead master._

### Henchmen



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>







#### Skeleton Warriors
20 gold crowns to hire  
_The battlefields of the Old World are strewn with the graves of many nameless warriors who have fallen in combat and been consigned to a hasty resting place, or left upon the ground amidst the carnage. Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching towards him?_

**Immune to Poison:** Skeletons are not affected by any poison.

**No Brain:** Skeletons are mindless automatons incapable of earning experience.


#### 0-5 Hellhounds
25 gold crowns to hire  
_Hell Hounds represent a curious incentive for foes to stay and fight the Blood Dragon rather than flee, no matter how impossible victory may be. A swift decapitation is preferable to being torn to shreds by undead fangs after all.._

```
```

#### 0-3 Grave Guard
35 gold crowns to hire  
_Grave Guards are undead warriors, raised by the vampire to serve him as guards. Although they look very similar to ordinary skeletons, they are driven by an eternal hate for all living beings which can be seen in the green fire which burns within their empty eye sockets._
