#### Nordland

A long stretch of territory marks the northern and western 
coasts of the Empire. It is too varied to have a unified 
populous and too thin to be defensible against land invasions,
indeed its Elector Counts have always struggled to maintain 
control over its furthest reaches - its stated claim to the 
regions bordering Kislev to the northeast and Marienburg 
to the southwest little more than a technicality as its people
live largely independent lives. The lack of control of its 
government over its territory would for any other country in 
the Empire spell immediate doom, but there is an understanding
among even the most pompous Reikland officer that nobody wants
to have to govern Nordland, for its resources are meagre, its 
people are unseemly, and it is the constant victim to Norscan,
Beastmen, and Dark Elf raids against which it can do nothing but defend. 

The distain that Nordlanders recieve from their southerly kin 
is born from their ancestry. Nordland's forests are bleak, 
monster-infested places with rocky ground and are ill-suited 
for farming or the formation of large settlements. While to 
southerners this made it inhospitable and unfavourable it was
a haven to the Norscans, who had been used to violent blizzards
and perpetual starvation for generations. They formed the initial
settlers who, through exposure to (and conquest by) their 
Middenland cousins and distance from the Chaos Wastes, over
time intermingled to become the Nordlanders of today.

Nordlanders are typically a stout and resilient people just 
at home at sea as on land, with a rich and varied culture
that maintains its ancestral love of storytelling, hunting,
and governmental practices such as trial by combat that 
other Empire courts frown upon. Its people are blunt and
unsubtle, with little time or interest in political intrigues 
or backstabbery - a trait that when combined with their 
adoption of the Cult of Ulric allowed them to become trusted
allies with Middenland. They serve as the coastal line of
defence that protects the heart of the Empire from the 
predations of all seaborne threats, and as a consequence 
they harbour the entire Empire navy. Most of these ships
are not their own, but even ships from Stirland will 
still employ local crews - giving a sense of national 
pride in what is in practice the Nordland navy.

While many human territories host populations of halflings
(and even a few Ogre mercenaries), Nordland is the only
territory that has an indiginous population of Wood Elves,
and it is the only existing example of a successful 
integration between the two. Nordland settlers are permitted
certain areas within the Elven portions of the Forest 
of Shadows, and in return the Elves are permitted to maintain 
their isolationist way of life. While most Elves are 
loathe to deal with the so often greedy and impatient humans,
the Nordlanders' bluntness and transparancy of thought
has earned them an affectionate sort of trust. It is not
uncommon as a consequence to see Elves rubbing shoulders 
with Humans in Nordland warbands - though this practice is 
frowned upon by the more extreme and Sigmarite parts of the Empire.

As brave and as rugged as the Nordlanders are they are
also known for their bullheadedness. Imperial Generals
treat Nordland infantry like hounds on leashes to keep
them under control, for their Norscan blood burns hottest
in the midst of battle and discipline is difficult to maintain.
While they may not be as broad or powerful as Middenlanders in
stature they are far more impatient and eager to fight, with
Nordland fighters typically being wiry and scrappy loudmouths
who inexplicably feel compelled to fight - even against 
creatures larger than them, such as Beastmen.

Special Rules:
Scrappy: All humans in the Nordland warband who begin their
turn within the charge range of at least one opponent must
take a Leadership test. If passed they may behave as normal,
if failed they become Immune to Psychology for that turn 
and then must attempt to charge. They do not need to take
this test if the only way they could engage the enemy is
with an Initiative test (as in they would have to jump off 
of a building, or detect an enemy around a corner).

Hates Norscans.. Kind of: It isn't so much a hatred as a 
friendly and violent rivalry. They enjoy the back-and-forth
of hurled insults, and while Nordlanders gain the Hatred 
(Chaos) special rule its all good fun really. Only applies to the Humans.

Skyrim Belongs To The Nords!: Oops, wrong game. The 
leader of your warband must be Human.
