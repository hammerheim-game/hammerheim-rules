# Norlanders
</div>

A long stretch of territory marks the northern and western coasts of the Empire. It is too large to have a unified populace and too thin to be defensible against land invasions. Indeed its Elector Counts have always struggled to maintain control over its furthest reaches - its stated claim to the  regions bordering Kislev to the northeast and Marienburg to the southwest is little more than a technicality as its people live largely independent lives. The lack of control of its  government over its own territory would for any other country in the Empire spell immediate doom as power-hungry rivals seek to annex otherwise indefensible territories, but there is an understanding among even the most pompous Reikland officer that nobody wants to have to govern Nordland, for its resources are meagre, its people are unseemly, and it is the constant victim to Norscan, Beastmen, and Dark Elf raids against which it can do nothing but be the Empire's bulwark. 

The disdain that Nordlanders recieve from their southerly kin  is born from their ancestry. Nordland's forests are bleak,  monster-infested places with rocky ground and are ill-suited  for farming or the formation of large settlements. While to southerners this made it inhospitable and unfavourable it was a lush haven to the Norscans, who had been used to violent blizzards and perpetual starvation for generations. They formed the initial settlers who, through exposure to (and conquest by) their  Middenland cousins, over time intermingled to become the Nordlanders of today.

Nordlanders are typically a stout and resilient people just as at home at sea as they are on land, with a rich and varied culture that maintains its ancestral love of storytelling, hunting, and governmental practices such as trial by combat that  other Empire courts frown upon. Its people are blunt and unsubtle, with little time or interest in political intrigues  or backstabbery - a trait that when combined with their adoption of the Cult of Ulric allowed them to become trusted allies of Middenland. They serve as the only coastal line of defence that protects the heart of the Empire from the predations of all seaborne threats, and as a consequence they harbour the entire Empire navy. Most of these ships are not their own, but even ships from Stirland will still employ local crews - giving a sense of national pride in what is in practice the Nordland navy.

While many human territories host populations of halflings
(and even a few Ogres here and there), Nordland is the only
territory that has a known indiginous population of Wood Elves,
and it is the only existing example of a successful 
integration between the two races. Nordland settlers are permitted
certain areas within the Elven portions of the Forest 
of Shadows, and in return the Elves are permitted to maintain 
their isolationist way of life. While most Elves are 
loth to deal with the so often greedy and impatient humans,
the Nordlanders' bluntness and transparancy of thought
has earned them a measure of trust. It is not
uncommon as a consequence to see Elves rubbing shoulders 
with Humans in Nordland warbands - though this practice is 
frowned upon by the more conservative and Sigmarite parts of the Empire.

As brave and as rugged as the Nordlanders are they are
also known for their bullheadedness. Imperial Generals
treat Nordland infantry like hounds on leashes to keep
them under control, for their Norscan blood burns hottest
in the midst of battle and discipline is difficult to maintain.
While they may not be as broad or powerful as Middenlanders in
stature they are far more impatient and eager to fight, with
Nordland fighters typically being wiry and scrappy loudmouths
who inexplicably feel compelled to fight, even against 
creatures larger than them, such as Beastmen.

### Special Rules
**Scrappy:** All humans in the Nordland warband who begin their turn within the charge range of at least one opponent must take a Leadership test. If passed they may behave as normal. If failed they become Immune to Psychology for that turn  and then must attempt to charge. They do not need to take this test if the only way they could engage the enemy is with an Initiative test (as in they would have to jump off of a building, or detect an enemy around a corner). 
**Hates Norscans.. Kind of:** It isn't so much a hatred as a 
friendly and violent rivalry. They enjoy the back-and-forth
of hurled insults, and while Nordlanders gain the _Hatred 
(Norsca & Marauders)_ special rule its all good fun really. Only applies to the Humans. 
**Skyrim Belongs To The Nordlanders!:** Oops, wrong game. The leader of your warband must be Human. 
**Alignment:** The Warband's Alignment may be either Lawful/Neutral, or Neutral.

With uppity young firebrands constantly barking challenges, the ability to skillfully disarm or de-escalate with but a sentence is highly valued._

#### 0-1 Elven Adventurer
55 gold crowns to hire  
_Elves usually have their own duplicitous reasons for agreeing to anything, but in the case of the Nordlanders there is often a more genuine partnership.

**Slow Witted:** Although Ogres are capable of earning experience and bettering themselves they are not the smartest of creatures. Ogres only gain advances at half the rate of everyone else (I.e. they must accrue twice as much experience as normal to get an advance).  
**Scrappy:** Ogres simply can't be around that much fightiness without it rubbing off on them. They have the same _Scrappy_ special rule as the humans.
