#### Pit Fighter Warband

All across the world you can find gladiatorial pit fights, here
you can find hardy fighters taking up arms against each other.
From the vicious pits of Cutthroat’s Haven to the Black Pits
surrounding Mordheim there can be heard the clash of steel.
In most places local law itself bans these fights, but the
culture itself remains a haven for ex-mercenaries, escaped
convicts and itinerant conmen and bribes to local officials
ensures that this brutal sport continues unabated.
There are as many different type of fight as there are venues,
from small fistfights in an old barn or a back alley to huge
conflicts with many heavily armed combatants. Most fighters
are slaves who work for the so-called ‘circuit’. They try to
earn their freedom by paying off their owners with a large cut
of the winnings. Most successful Pit Fighters live for the
sport (and of course often die for it also!) because they know
of little else.
The men in this Warband consist solely of professional Pit
Fighters who were either able to buy their freedom or have
escaped. Now they roam the streets of Mordheim in search
for the Wyrdstone that would bring them wealth faster than
anyone can imagine.
The Pit Fighters are used to fighting in streets and small
corridors and this makes them a much-feared opponent. The
Pit King is the most skilled and cunning Pit Fighter of them
all who leads his band with an iron fist.
Appearance: Pit Fighters are grizzled veteran warriors
covered with many scars of battle, they are armed with
special Pit Weapons and Armor, their bodies well developed
and muscular. They wear little clothing and only partial
armor known as Pit Armor.

##### Special Rules

Free the Slaves!: Pit Fighters hate all Slavers. The Pit
Fighters will never sell their captured opponents to the
slavers. 
In the Pit!: Pit Fighters who capture an opponent may decide
to let him fight in the infamous fighting pits of Cutthroat’s
Haven.
The Pit Fighter Warband may decide to send in one or more
of their own fighters to fight the captive, if the Pit Fighter
wins he gains +2 Experience, the Warband gets all the
Captive’s armor and weapons +50gc, if the Pit Fighter loses
then roll to see whether he is dead or injured as normal
(ignore all following results: Robbed, Captured, Hardened,
Sold to the Pits and Survives Against the Odds), he will not
lose his armor or weapons, the Captive will get the 50 GC
and the +2 Experience when he wins. If the Captive wins the
audience decides whether he gains his freedom. Roll a D6 on
a 4+ the audience raise their thumbs and he is free. A 1-3
means he remains the Pit Fighters Captive and may be fielded
in the pits after future games. Note that The Pit counts as
a building for the purpose of the Pit Fighter skill.

following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

0-1 Dwarf Troll Slayer
50 gold crowns to hire
Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult obsessed with
seeking an honourable death in combat. Having committed some
unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in some way, a Dwarf will
forsake his home and wander off to die fighting the enemies of
Dwarf kind. Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals,
psychopathic and violent. There are, however, few better fighters in
the Known World, so which place would be more fitting for them
than the dangerous fighting pits then! Battling against the most
hardened veterans and monsters known in the Old World, it seems
that they have found themselves a second place, to call home.

Special Rules
Pit Fighter: See Strength Skill section.
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignores the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for the
supremacy of the Old World. If the Pit Fighters ever hire any
kind of Elven Hired Sword he will leave the Warband
immediately, he refuses to fight alongside these pansy Elves!
Death Wish: Troll Slayers seek an honourable death in
combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and
never need to test if fighting alone.

Special Rules
Pit Fighter: See Strength Skill section.
Fear: Ogre Pit Fighters are large, threatening creatures that
cause Fear. See the Psychology section for details.
Large: Ogre Pit Fighters are huge, lumbering creatures and
therefore make tempting targets for archers. Any model may
shoot at the Ogre Pit Fighter, even if he is not the closest
target.
Skills: An Ogre Pit Fighter who becomes a Hero as a result
of The Lad’s Got Talent may choose from the Combat,
Strength and Pit Fighter Special Skills.
Slow Witted: Although Ogres are capable of earning
experience and bettering themselves they are not the smartest
creatures. Ogres only gain advances at half the rate of
everyone else (I.e. they must accrue twice as much
experience as normal to get an advance).
