# Pit Fighters
</div>

Life among the peasantry in the Old One is often brief and brutal, spent in such constant fear that recreation is minimal. Exhausted townsfolk vary in passtimes from culture to culture; Nordlanders partaking in song and poetry, Reikland carnivals passing from city to city, or the Ostermark pantomimes. Some attractions are universal - many towns in fact form up around lone taverns constructed along trade routes, and innkeeping is considered a very respectable trade, one that is passed down from generation to generation.

Taverns are a curious place in the Empire, for while the abundance of alcohol inevitably causes all manner of public order issues the local guard often turn a blind eye so long as it remains isolated within the building, only taking action to crack down if violence spreads out onto the streets. In large part this is because the taverns themselves are as much a refuge for law enforcement as they are the general public, and while some tavernkeepers maintain strict rules the more unscrupulous use this as an opportunity to provide all manner of illicit vices, with written word-of-mouth events where for a few hours a night the tavern will become a smuggling hall, brothel, or most commonly a gambling den where patrons bet on Pit Fighters.

All across the world you can find these gladiatorial pit fights. Here some of the toughest combatants all across the Empire participate in brutal and lawless trials by combat. In more 'enlightened' cultures like Reikland these take place in the basements of taverns concealled from public view, but in others the pit fights have become so popular that entire arenas are set up as permanent fixtures.




In most places local law itself bans these fights, but the culture itself remains a haven for ex-mercenaries, escaped convicts, deserters, and itinerant conmen and bribes to local officials ensures that this brutal sport continues unabated. There are as many different type of fight as there are venues, from small fistfights in an old barn or a back alley to huge conflicts with many heavily armed combatants.

While some fighters become Pit Fighters by choice, often adopting colourful personas to play to the crowd and build vast fanbases, most are slaves who work for the so-called ‘circuit’. They try to earn their freedom by paying off their owners with a large cut of the winnings, though fights are invariably organized or fixed by their owners to ensure this can never occur - thus an unfortunate Fighter may find themselves inexplicably being listed for an unarmed Pit Fight against a Middenlander. The most seasoned Pit Fighters live for the sport (and of course often die for it also!) because they know of little else. 

When Mordheim was at its peak it was not only the cultural center of the Empire, but also had become a profoundly decadent and depraved place. The slave market was enormous, and law enforcement so minimal that Pit Fights became big business. When the comet struck the entire social order was changed, and in the rampant chaos that ensued many Pit Fighters saw an opportunity to retake their freedom by force - nobody would ever think to question a murdered slavemaster in a city whose entire population had just been obliterated by a comet after all.

Now these freed Pit Fighters roam the streets of Mordheim in search for the Wyrdstone that would bring them wealth faster than anyone can imagine in the hopes of starting a new life. While every warband will have its own preferred tactics no warriors are more cunning or improvisational than the Pit Fighters, for survival in The Pits requires as much agility or guile as it does strength. While on an open field they may be a close match to trained mercenaries, in the enclosed, uncomfortable, and uneven terrain of Mordheim's splintered houses they are unrivaled combatants.

### Special Rules
**Hates Slavers:** Warriors in Pit Fighter warbands _hate_ warriors from any slaver warbands, such as Corsairs.	
**Into The Pit!:** You may never sell a captured warrior to slavers if you capture them after a battle. You may ransom them back to the owning player as normal, but should they refuse the price you set you may organize a Pit Fight! To organize a Pit Fight you must do the following in a strict order:
1. Choose any number of combatants to fight the warrior. They will then fight in The Pits as described later, though at this stage the participants may be negotiated with the owning player.
2. Declare this fight to the captured warrior's owning player. This is entirely your decision, if they do not like the fight you propose then tough. Once this has been declared you may not change your mind - this is the fight that you have arranged and through your contacts word is already being spread to Ostermark towns to come and bet on the fight.
3. The owning player's warband may attempt a Rescue mission if they choose. Note that setting up a fair fight may incentivise owning players not to attempt Rescue missions - after all, victory in The Pits is lucrative!
4. Resolve the fight as if it was the Sold To The Pits injury result, then consult the below:

##### I won the fight!
The captured Warrior rolls on the first half of the Serious Injury chart, as do any of your warriors that were put Out of Action. Assuming they survive they are returned to their owning warband with no further loss.
You gain 50 gold coins in fight money and may allocate 2 Experience Points among any participants.

##### I lost the fight...
Your Out of Action Warriors roll on the first half of the Serious Injury chart. Your opponent returns to the owning player's warband, gains +2 Experience, and they gain 50 gold coins.	
**Alignment:** The Warband's Alignment may be either Lawful/Neutral, Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

#### **0-4 A-Listers**
40 gold crowns to hire.	
_A-Listers are the Pit Fighters who draw in the crowds. They have already mastered combat and know their preferred weapons, and now seek to develop a persona for themselves to resonate with the audience. Some adopt heroic mannerisms, while others play the role of heel._

#### 0-2 Pit Slayers
50 gold crowns to hire	
_Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals, psychopathic and violent. There are, however, few better fighters in the Known World, so what place would be more fitting for them than the dangerous fighting pits? Battling against the most hardened veterans and monsters known in the Old World, it seems that they have found themselves a second place, to call home - one that welcomes them._

**Pit Fighter:** Pit Slayers have the _Pit Fighter_ skill by default.	
**Hatred:** Pit Slayers _hate_ Greenskins and Skaven.	
**Immune to Psychology:** Pit slayers are _immune to psychology_.	
**Distrusts Elves:** Though outcasts among their kind Pit Slayers are still Dwarfs. They have a deep bitterness towards Elves and therefore, as long as a Pit Slayer is in your warband, you may never form Formal Alliances with an Elf warband of any type.	
**Relentless:** Pit Slayers are never prevented from running by foes within 8".	
**None of My Business:** The Slayer may have formed friendships with their fellow fighters, but makes no secret that they have joined the warband to die. Pit Slayers may never be your warband leader, though should your leader be put Out of Action you may still use the Slayer's leadership for the purposes of rout tests. Watching your screaming Slayer butcher their way through the foe is pretty motivating.
