# Tilea
</div>


The land of Tilea is home to some of the most wealthy and aloof people in the Old World. It is a commercially competitive society of combative city states and personal rivalries. It is civic pride and a desire for financial status that drives each and every Tilean. To this end, the Tileans have become proficient sailors and explorers. They set sail for all ports in the Old World and drop anchor off the shores of far distant lands in search of gold and precious artefacts that can often bring a hefty price in any market of the world.

The Tileans have fought hard for their independence, and take great pride in the cultural differences that have emerged between their various city-states. Many of them have seen generations of war between them as politicking nobles vie for trade supremacy, and complicated webs of inter-marrying maintain a dramatic shifting landscape of alliances and wars. In spite of this, Tileans are proud of their shared history and consider themselves a far more advanced society than their Empire cousins to the North.

In a way they are right. Most Tileans live fairly cosmopolitan lives, and while aristocratic at its core there is at least some semblance of local democracy among its people. Literacy rates are high, and Tileans are on average the longest-lived humans in the Old World. Were it not for their overall rejection of the Cult of Sigmar and secular (with the exception of Chaos) society, citizens of the Empire would probably migrate in droves.

### Tilean Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Tilean warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origins of your warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section. 







## Miragliano

The Mighty Principality of Miragliano is one of the most powerful city-states within Tilea, a bastion of defiance against the Skaven hordes of the great Under-Empire. Because of its position near the Blighted Marshes, which are fetid and ridden with disease, Miragliano has often been victim to outbreaks of plague over the centuries.

The Red Pox of 1812 was the worst pestilence, wiping out three quarters of the population of the city. An infestation of large rats was blamed, and since then the city has employed professional rat-catchers among its mercenary troops. As well as exterminating rats, the rat-catchers fight running battles against Skaven Gutter Runners. Many Tileans however still deny the existence of Skaven, leaving 
Miragliano's sudden decline a source of intense speculation.

No one knows exactly where the Skaven come from, except that there are many of them in and around the fringes of the Blighted Marshes. A high price is placed on their heads, dead or alive. Since the Red Pox, large parts of the old, squalid city have been rebuilt by the Princes of Miragliano, but the impact of the outbreak is still keenly felt by its people.

Miragleans are known to host some of the finest crossbow regiments in Tilea. Relatively cheap to maintain in comparison to black powder weapons, it has worked to their advantage so far - the superior accuracy of the crossbow has proven an excellent aid in finding their marks on the jittery and evasive Skaven.

##### Special Rules
**Superior Arbalests:** Miralgeans get +1 To Hit when firing Crossbows. 
**Red Pox:** Miraglians have not forgotten the deadly effects that contact with ratmen can bring, and a deep fear of uncleanliness and contagion sits in their stomachs. As a result, all Miraglians _fear_ Skaven. 
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral, Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

## Remas
The city-state republic of Remas is tolerated rather than liked by the other Tilean states, and is not so affectionately known as The Rebellious Republic of Remas by its rivals. Its central location and easy ability to extort fortunes from tarrifs on goods crossing from one part of Tilea to the other enabled Remas to accrue a vast and well-trained Mercenary army, becoming for a time the Jewel of Tilea.

This lasted until 1487, some two hundred years ago, when a dreaded Black Ark, lured by the prospect of wealth and slaves, infiltrated the city under the cover of a vast conjured fog and put its inhabitants to the slaughter.

The Corsair raid was ultimately repelled by the Remasen Pikemen, whose rank and file wall of spikes atop their great bridge proved unbreakable to the Corsair's lightly armoured but rapid-striking forces. This event elevated the Remas Pikemen to an exalted state by its surviving people who have adopted the pike as their national icon, but the memories of the horrific acts perpetrated by the Corsairs remain a blight upon their public conscience.

##### Special Rules
**Remasen Pikemen:** Basic "Warrior" henchmen from Remasen warbands may be equipped with Pikes for only 5gc, though once equipped in this way they may not trade their Pikes to other warriors. 
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral, Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

## Trantio

Trantio was the first city to overthrow its Prince and become a republic, starting the trend that would eventually see Tilea become a nation of independent city-states. It was never one of the more prosperous nations however due to its lack of proximity to the sea, the trade routes to the Empire being at the time inhospitable, and Greenskin-infested mountain passes or trade roads plagued by bandits and extortionate tolls.

As its rivals accumulated wealth and power Trantio became an easy target for invasion, particularly from its neighbour Remas. Only through masterful diplomacy and subterfuge did Trantio manage to survive, forging tactical alliances and building complex relationships through strategic marriages in order to play off their rivals one against another.

That all changed however when a Trantian merchant named Marco Colombo ventured on a mad voyage to Lustria, and returned with wealth the likes of which had never been seen. Overthrowing his previous patron he took control of the city and assisted the local Dwarfs in the retaking of their mountain passes - thereby opening trade routes to the Empire. By also establishing these trade routes Trantio was opened up to the cultures of the world, and when combined with further expeditions to Lustria earning them increasingly large fortunes they quickly became without doubt the wealthiest of the Tilean city states.

Trantio is closely allied with Marienburg, which they perhaps rightly see as their only peers. The duelling culture of Marienburg has become enormously fashionable in Trantio as a result, though few Trantians are aware of the skullduggery that occurs behind the scenes there. The concept of a duellist has become a romanticized ideal of flair and drama, of poetic speeches and immaculate moustaches, and of passionate love affairs.

Meanwhile in Marienburg their duellists frequently wonder why they both have diarrhoea and their guns don't work.

##### Special Rules
**Lustrian Fortunes:** Trantio warbands start with 600 gold crowns to spend, rather than the usual 500. 
**Duellists:** Trantio warbands no longer have the 0-5 restriction on Duellists, and Duellists may re-roll all Diving Charge attempts.  
**Alignment:** Trantio warbands are Lawful, or Lawful/Neutral.

**Range:** Hand-to-hand; **Strength:** As User
>##### Special Rules
**Superior Reach:** Pikes are large weapons almost three times a human's body length. As a result, a Warrior with a Pike may attack opponents in Hand-to-Hand combat up to 3" away (though may not attack through solid walls, and the target must be in line of sight). You may never gain Diving Charge bonuses while using a Pike.   
**Enormously Unwieldy:** A Pike is not a weapon that can be sheathed or strapped to one's back. A Warrior equipped with a Pike may possess no other weapons, nor a buckler or shield.   
**Requires two hands:** Simply holding a Pike horizontal is an incredible feat of strength!

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ### Rapier
**Range:** Hand-to-hand; **Strength:** As User
>##### Special Rules
**Sword:** Rapiers are swords. They may Parry, and gain any benefits from sword-related skills. 
**Flurry:** Any unmodified roll of a 6 to hit allows the wielder to attempt an additional attack. These additional attacks may trigger additional attacks.
