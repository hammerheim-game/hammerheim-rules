#### Tilean Warband

The land of Tilea is home to some of the most wealthy and
aloof people in the Old World. A land that is divided by its
own competition of trade and separated by personal feuds and
warring city-states. It is civic pride and a desire for financial
status that drives each and every Tilean. To this end, the
Tileans have become proficient sailors and explorers. They
set sail for all ports in the Old World and drop anchor off the
shores of far distant lands in search of gold and precious
artefacts that can often bring a hefty price in any market of
the world.
Tilean warbands are often hired to explore the steamy
jungles, hot deserts or even the ruined city like Mordheim
either by their patron city-state or by wealthy merchants or
guilds. There are many city-states in Tilea to base a
warband’s history on although only the most prominent three
will be dealt with here. You can create a pirate warband
hailing from Sartosa or a warband of acolytes of the patron
god Lucan from Luccini if you so desire. Whatever warband
suites your fancy you’ll find that the land of Tilea is rich with
history to base it upon. You’ll also find a Tilean warband to
be structured much like the mercenary warbands but there are
subtle differences that reflect the rich Tilean history.

##### Miragleans

The Miragleans are deadly accurate with the city’s official
weapon, the crossbow. All warriors recruited from this section
gain +1 to hit when using crossbows. All humans in a Miraglean
warband also gain the Hatred (Skaven) special rule. This dates
back to the red pox outbreak of 1812 when three quarters of 
the population of the city perished, leaving them a city in 
decline. Many Tileans still deny the existence of Skaven, leaving 
Miragliano's sudden decline a source of intense speculation.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Remasens

The city-state republic of Remas is tolerated rather than liked
by the other Tilean states. Their central location and easy ability
to extort vast fortunes from tarrifs on goods crossing from one
part of Tilea to the other enabled Remas to accrue a vast and 
well-trained Mercenary army, becoming for a time the Jewel of
Tilea. This lasted until 1487 when a Dark Elf navy, lured by
the prospect of wealth and slaves, infiltrated the city under the
cover of unseasonal mist and put it to the slaughter. The corsair raid
was ultimately repelled by the Remasen Pikemen, whose rank and file
wall of spikes atop their great bridge proved unbreakable to the 
corsair's lightly armoured but rapid-striking forces. This event
elevated the Remas Pikemen to a state of reverence by its surviving
people who have adopted the pike as their national icon, but the
memories of the horrific acts perpetrated by the corsairs during
their stay remain a blight upon their public conscience.

Remasen basic "Warrior" henchmen may be equipped with Pikes for
only 5g. They also gain the Fear (Dark Elves) Special Rule.

Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Trantio

Trantio was the first city to overthrow its Prince and become
a republic, starting the trend that would eventually see Tilea
become a nation of vast, independent city-states. It was never
one of the more prosperous nations however, and as its rivals
accumulated wealth and power Trantio became an easy target for
invasion, only managing to survive through masterful diplomacy
and subterfuge to play off their rivals against one another.
That all changed however when a Trantian merchant named Marco
Colombo ventured on a mad voyage to Lustria, and returned with
enormous wealth. Overthrowing his previous patron he took
control of the city and by establishing close trade relations
with the Dwarfs to the north while continuing his expeditions
to raid for Lustrian gold he transformed Trantio into without
doubt the wealthiest city in Tilea. As a result Tilean warbands
start with 600g rather than the usual 500g.

The fantastical tales of Marco Colombo inspired a whole generation
of mercenaries eager to make a name for themselves too, adopting
a flair for the dramatic and a style of combat heavily influenced
by the duellists of Marienburg. Trantio warbands no longer
have the 0-5 restriction on Duellists, and Duellists may
re-roll all Diving Charge attempts.


Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
