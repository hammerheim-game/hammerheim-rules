#### Shadow Warrior Warbands

Nagarythe was once one of the most prosperous and beautiful
of the kingdoms of the High Elven land of Ulthuan. When the
Witch King Malekith and his mother Morathi led the
kingdom of Nagarythe astray into worship of the Chaos
Gods, not all of their people followed. When Malekith led his
people in a rebellion against the rightful Phoenix King, those
who had not been converted to depravity remained loyal to
the throne of Ulthuan and waged a secret war, a war of
shadows, against the Witch King and his armies. When the
Witch King was defeated and forced to flee with his
followers, most of these ‘shadow warriors’ were killed,
drowned by the sea as their land was torn asunder by the
Witch King’s foul magics.
The people of Nagarythe that survived became a nation of
wanderers, moving from place to place and never really
welcomed by other High Elves, for these Shadow Elves as
they became known had gained a reputation for being a fierce
and warlike people, full of cruelty. This reputation, while
probably only partially true, sets the Shadow Elves apart
from other members of their race. This, along with their grim
attitude and generally dark presence, makes other High Elves
feel ill at ease around them. In Ulthuan they are misfits and
outcasts, and many of these proud people seek their fortunes
outside Ulthuan entirely. They truly are a race ‘in the
shadows’ between the cruel darkness of the Dark Elves, and
the beautiful light of the other High Elves.
Some of the Elves of Nagarythe have been driven mad by this
condition, but most have accepted their existence, and are
driven on by a desire for revenge against the arch nemesis the
Witch King and his perverse mother. The Shadow Elves form
themselves into warbands and travel the lands of Ulthuan and
the Known World, sometimes fighting Dark Elves (and other
forces of Chaos) when they find them, and fighting just to
survive the remainder of the time. Some still work in the
service of the Phoenix king, acting as scouts and trackers for
his armies. Sometimes small units of these warriors will be
sent by their king to distant lands on a special mission for
Ulthuan – recovery of ancient artefacts left behind when the
High Elves abandoned the Old World, or sabotage of a
rumoured plot of the Dark Elves. When sent on such a
mission, these bands bring their military trappings with them

- standards and war horns, unit insignia fiercely emblazoned
on their shields – for the Shadow Elves take pride in their
loyalty to the Phoenix King. Other warbands represent small
groups of warriors seeking their fortune... though still loyal to
Ulthuan, they may no longer feel welcome in their island
home, or perhaps they represent a family pursuing a personal
vendetta against a particular Dark Elf leader. Whatever the
case, bands of Shadow Warriors may occasionally be seen
roving the lands of the Old World to exploring the steamy
jungles of Lustria.
Due to their wandering nature, it’s not uncommon to see
Shadow Warriors travelling the lands of the Empire, so they
should fit right in your normal games of Hammerheim.
However, the Empire is not the only land these tireless

warriors travel to in their quest to rid the world of Dark
Elves. As more settings are introduced for the game, you will
be able to take your Shadow Warriors to other lands, such as
the jungles of Lustria as introduced in Lustria Cities of Gold.
You should not feel constrained to keep the Shadow Warriors
in one city, it is their nature to wander.
##### Special Rules

Hate Dark Elves: All warriors in a Shadow Warrior
Warband (excluding any Hired Swords) have an unyielding
Hatred for Dark Elves.
Distaste for Poison: The use of poisons and various drugs is
a Dark Elf specialty. As such, it is frowned upon by Shadow
Warriors, even more so than by other High Elves. Warriors in
a Shadow Warrior Warband may not use poisons of any type.
Unforgiving: In addition to their hatred of their corrupt kin,
the folk of Nagarythe have a long history of struggle against
the forces of Chaos. In multiplayer games, a Shadow Warrior
warband may never forge an alliance with any Warband of a
Chaotic nature (Possessed, Skaven, Beastmen, Dark Elves,
etc.).
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Elves of Nagarythe have learned to stifle their distaste for
‘lesser races’, and have even been known to work alongside
them from time to time. A Shadow Warrior Warband may
hire any Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so
no Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.

##### Heroes

1 Shadow Master
70 Gold Crowns to hire
Shadow Master is a very honourable title among the warriors of the
Shadow Elves... it is given to one who has fought in the shadow war
for so long that he rules the darkness that he fights from. Often a
member of the former Nagarythe nobility, the captain of a Shadow
Warrior Warband is known by the honourable title ‘Shadow
Master’. These proud and strong-willed warriors often gather a
small band of their followers and seek a life away from the hesitant
charity and distasteful stares of Ulthuan.

use his Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.
0-3 Shadow Walker
45 Gold Crowns to hire
One step down from the title of Shadow Master is Shadow Walker. A
walker in the shadows is considered to have made friends with the
darkness, and while he does not command it, it gives him aid when
asked. Shadow Walkers are seasoned veterans in the war against
the Dark Elves. They are skilled trackers and hunters, and the most
trusted lieutenants of the Warband’s captain, the Shadow Master.

0-1 Shadow Weaver
55 Gold Crowns to hire
All High Elves have some aptitude for magic, and those with the
greatest aptitude are taught how to bend the Winds of Magic to their
will. Shadow Weavers are the mages of Nagarythe. Due to the
nature of their unending war against the Dark Elves, the mages of
Nagarythe tend to specialise in magics that use shadows to conceal
their presence and confound their enemies. In fact the title Shadow
Weaver comes from the nature of their magic... like a talented
tailor, the Shadow Weaver takes the threads of shadow and fashions
them into shapes and forms of his choosing.

the Shadow Weaver may choose from the Shadow Warrior
Special Skill list.

Magic User: The Shadow Weaver has the ability to use
magic and casts spells like any other magicians, and the
Shadow Weaver starts with one spells generated at random
from the Shadow Magic list. See the Magic section for
details. In addition the Shadow Weaver may learn a new
Spell instead on a new skill.


##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Shadow Warriors
35 Gold Crowns to hire
Most of the warriors in the Shadow Warrior Warband are veterans
of at least one battle, and all have lost loved ones to the depravity of
the Dark Elves.

Shadow Warrior Novices
25 Gold Crowns to hire
These are untested Shadow Elves, newly inducted into the warband.
Often these warriors are younger cousins who are setting out from
Ulthuan for the first time. Due to their hard existence, it is often a
quick progression from Novice to full Warrior, however.
