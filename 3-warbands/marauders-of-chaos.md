# Marauders of Chaos
</div>

Norsca is a frigid, barren, icy place that breeds a violent and mystical raider culture, and to its north the tundras give way to the apocalyptic hellscape of the Chaos Wastes. The Norscans that live in closest proximity to this border are the ones most affected by its seeping and ebbing corrupion, their traditions over time changing to closer reflect the designs of the Chaos Gods. 

These are the Norscans who are considered to be Marauders of Chaos. While southeners may not recognise (or more likely, simply don't care about) the difference between one group of raiders and another, it is one that frequently brings the two groups to blows. 

Worship of the Chaos Gods leads to often incredible power in the form of marks that magically sear themselves into the flesh of their worshippers. These marks vary depending on the god worshipped, but can imbue superhuman strength or magical aptitude. Eager to further their rewards, Marauders seek to extend the reach of Chaos further south to the yet-untainted Norscan tribes. Tribes that convert are swiftly assimilated, and Chieftains can quickly build vast hordes by dominating smaller clans in this way.

Failure is similarly punished. Should a Chieftain fail in their worship or otherwise disappoint their patron gods they may suffer all manner of horrible outcomes, worst of all being the transformation into a Spawn.

Marauders of Chaos live in the harshest conditions of the Old World, and their lives are daily battles for survival against starvation, predation, and icy attrition. Their only sources of food are from hunting the gigantic Mammoth beasts of the tundra, and their only sources of material wealth are what they can raid from each other or southeners - the barren Chaos Wastes do not even offer metals to mine. 

The Marauders that consequentially survive long enough to get any marauding done are hardened warriors clad in little more than pelts and tattoos, and they endlessly strive to win the attention of their patron gods by proving themselves in battle. Some of the more ambitious chieftains lead their warbands south to the Cathayan Borderlands, leaving burned villages and bloody trails in their wake, seeking greater and greater challenges all for the glory of their dark gods.

### Special Rules

**Eye of The Gods:** After each battle roll a 2D6 and consult the below:

> ##### If you won the battle:
Add +1 to the total on your dice roll for every model the leader put Out of Action during the game. If the result is now 12 or higher you may choose a Mark of The Dark Gods for your leader!   
As soon as the leader receives a Mark of the Dark Gods through the _Eye of the Gods_ special rule this test is no longer taken. If the warband ever gains a new leader for whatever reason, the new leader automatically gains the _Eye of the Gods_ special rule as they attempt to earn their own mark.

> ##### If you lost the battle:
Add +1 to the total on your dice roll for each of your Heroes that was taken Out of Action during the battle. If the result is now 12 or higher your leader is punished for their failure and is transformed into a mindless Spawn! Remove the Hero and all their equipment as if they had died. Add a new Chaos Spawn to your roster. Spawns generated in this way do not contribute to your maximum number of Spawns.


**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

### Heroes

#### **1 Chieftain**
85 gold crowns to hire. 
_The Chieftain is the brutish head of the warband. They lead their tribe in their constant warfare and bloodshed in an attempt to win the approval of their fickle gods._   

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

**Skills:** The Chieftain may choose from Combat, Strength, and Speed skills.
___
##### Special Rules 
**Leader:** Any warrior within 6" of the Chieftain may use their Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.    
**Aspiring Champion:** If the Chieftain reaches the final row of experience they earn a free suit of Chaos Armour as a gift from their patron god. Chaos Armour grants a 4+ armour save, does not slow the wearer when combined with a shield, and may never be removed once it is put on. The wearer may cast spells while wearing it if they are a wizard.





#### **0-1 Seer**
45 gold crowns to hire  
_A Seer is the Chieftain’s advisor as their god tells them his will through the Seer's visions and dreams. The other tribesmen see the Seer's attunement to their gods as a great gift that is to be equally respected and feared._

##### Special Rules

**Mark of The Dark Gods:** When hired the Seer immediately gains a Mark of the Dark Gods. They may choose either; the Mark of the Serpent, the Mark of the Crow, the Mark of the Eagle, the Mark of the Hound, or the Mark of Darkness.



```
```






#### 0-1 Condemned
55 gold crowns to hire  
_A servant of a dark god who was foolish enough to turn away from his patron is forever condemned. If the traitor turns to another god for aid then they are often spared death, but suffer a fate many times worse. The servant suffers constant mutations at the hands of their old god but maintains vestiges of his humanity as his new god compensates for the mutations by restoring or altering the form of the servant. It is all in vain, as the unwitting servant eventually becomes a plaything of both gods who use the servant's body and soul as a contest of wills between themselves, completely uncaring of the condemned servant's fate._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | D6 | 3 | D6 | D6 | 1 | 4 | D3 | 5 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Condemned may not use weapons or armour, but suffers  no penalty for doing so.  
**Skills:** Condemned may choose from Combat, Strength, and Speed skills.

##### Special Rules
**Fear:** As an ever-changing abomination of nature, Condemned cause _Fear_.    
**Inconsistency:** The body of the Condemned is mutating permanently. The variable attributes WS, S, T and A are determined whenever they are needed for a dice roll.       
**Experience:** Whenever the Condemned would increase one of its variable attributes on level-up, the player rolls an appropriate die instead. If the player is satisfied with the result, they may set the attribute on that number (e.g. the player rolls a strength advance upon levelling up. Roll a D6 instead of increasing Strength, on a roll of 4 the player may choose to give the model S4). If the player does not like this result they instead gain a random mutation. Mutations that would alter a variable that has not yet been fixed have no effect - the Condemned's violent contortions simply reshape themselves to acommodate their new form.     
**Fate:** Once all variable attributes are set the Condemned may use weapons, armour and miscellaneous equipment as usual. However, if they have reached maximum experience and still have unfixed attributes, then their patron could not save them from their former god's wrath and their soul and body are lost. They turn into a terrifying Spawn of Chaos.


#### 0-3 Champions
45 gold crowns to hire  
_Champions are the strongest and most battle hardened warriors in the tribe. They fight constantly waiting for the day when they can finally be judged by their god as being worthy of his service._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** Champions may choose equipment from the Champions Equipment List.   
**Skills:** Champions may choose from Combat, Strength, and Speed skills.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Henchmen


#### 0-1 Spawn of Chaos
180 gold crowns to hire 
_Spawns of Chaos are former Chaos Champions who have been too heavily gifted by their gods and become terrifying mindless monstrosities._

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2D6 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 | D6+1 | 10 |
___
**Weapons/Armour:** None! Spawns of Chaos fight with claws, tentacles and other extremities. 

##### Special Rules
**Special Attacks:** Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.    
**Fear:** Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against nature and cause fear. 
**Random Movement:** The Spawn moves 2D6" straight ahead in each of its Compulsory Movement phases. Before it does so it’s player may turn it to give the direction. It does not double its movement for charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat. As with all random movement, it may never be intercepted or reacted to with skills or items (such as Flash Powder or Berserkergang) - its movements are just too unpredictable. 
**Unrelenting:** Chaos Spawns are impossible to deter, relentlessly attacking until they have reduced their targets to pulp or they themselves stop twitching. It is not unheard of for severed parts of a Chaos Spawn to wriggle about violently on the ground in an effort to attack everything around it for some time after the Spawn has died. The Chaos Spawn is Unbreakable and is also _Immune to Psychology_.  
**No Brain:** Spawns of Chaos are crazed unthinking masses of chaotically writhing flesh and therefore gain no experience.  
**Large:** Spawns of Chaos are _Large_ sized.

## Marks of The Dark Gods

The Eye of the Gods special rule may let the warband’s leader choose a Mark of the Dark Gods. With the exception of the Mark of Chaos Undivided there may never be two models in the warband with different Marks. Upon being hired Seers choose their Mark when in correspondence with the tribe, granting an audience with their god. A Seer who becomes leader at the same time has to choose the Mark for their associated patron when being rewarded through the Eye of the Gods. 

Heroes may take Marks of Chaos in addition to their Marks of The Dark Gods when gaining a skill up - though they must choose a Mark of Chaos that matches their Mark of The Dark Gods. These are known as Exalted Marks. A Mark of Tchar the Eagle could be combined with a Mark of Tzeentch for example to become an Exalted Mark of Tzeentch - benefitting from both skills in the process.

### Mark of Darkness.

_A Hero with this mark believes in Chaos in its purest blackest form instead of the division into four Chaos Gods, Chaos Undivided, or the four Colours of Chaos._ 

**Leader:** All warband members within the leader's leadership radius (6" normally) may re-roll all failed Leadership tests.

**Seer:** With the Seer of Darkness as the tribe's spiritual leader the warband is able to draw in a much wider array of Marauders to their banner, who will often compete with one another to join. As long as the Seer with the Mark of Darkness remains in your warband Marauder henchmen from this section cost 10 GC less.

A Seer of Darkness uses the spells from Chaos Rituals.

### Mark of Tchar the Eagle

_Tchar the Great Eagle is the Changer of the Ways, the Norscan interpretation of Tzeentch. He is the Master of the ever-mutating energy known as magic and his followers are skilful practitioners of the arcane arts._

**Leader:** The Hero is capable of casting spells and immediately learns one random spell from the Tchar Rituals. However, they suffer –1 on all rolls to cast unless they were a wizard before.

**Seer:** A Seer of Tchar has command of powerful sorcery. The sorcerer starts with two spells from the Tchar Rituals. The first can be chosen freely, the second is randomly determined. 
```
```
### Mark of the Hound

_Arkhar the Hound is the God of War, the Norscan interpretation of Khorne. He is worshipped on the battlefield by his warriors who shed blood in his name, charging their enemies with the battle-cry “Blood for the Blood God!”_

**Leader:** The Hero is subject to frenzy from now on. In addition, the Hero gains a 5+ Ward Save against Direct Damage and Magic Missile spells. (If the Mark of Khorne is later taken for the Exalted Mark of Khorne the combined effect is: Frenzy, +1 Attack, 3+ Ward Save against Direct Damage and Magic Missile spells).

**Seer:** A Seer with the mark of Arkhar counts as a Bloodfather. A Bloodfather is a war-priest and cannot cast spells. Instead he communes with daemons and his almighty deity through visions. Take a Leadership test each time a Bloodfather takes an enemy out of action in hand-to-hand combat. If the test is passed add +1 to the Weapons Skill, Strength, Toughness or Initiative of the war-priest until the end of the battle. Each characteristic can be increased only once in this way.

A Bloodfather may take Strength skills in addition to
those normally available to a Seer. 

### Mark of Onogal the Crow

_Onogal the Crow is the Lord of Decay who unleashes pestilence upon the world, the Norscan interpretation of Nurgle. Therefore his followers are almost completely immune to diseases and serious wounds._

**Leader:** The Hero gets +1 Toughness and may re-roll any Serious Injuries. 

**Seer:** The Seer uses the Nurgle Rituals, and is immune to poison.

### Mark of Shornaal the Serpent

_Shornaal the Serpent is the Dark Prince of Chaos, the Norscan interpretation of Slaanesh. The Lord of Pleasure is the patron of all things beautiful, sadistic, and seductive._

**Leader:** Enemy models that are not immune to psychology cannot attack the Hero in close combat unless they pass a Ld test with 3D6, discarding the lowest D6 result. If the roll is failed, these models are hit automatically in close combat. Once they pass, they do not have to test again for the duration of the battle. Note that the Lizardman’s Cold Blooded special rule cannot be applied to this effect.

**Seer:** A Seer of Shornaal uses the Shornaal Rituals. If the Seer wasn't taken out of action during the battle, instead of searching for rare items they may indulge their warband in a sickening communal ritual. All warband members in the following battle become _Immune to Psychology_, be it through eagerness for the next ritual or due to nothing fazing them after participating in such a harrowing ordeal.
