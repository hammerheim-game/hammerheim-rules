#### Marauders of Chaos

Norsca is a frigid, barren, icy place that breeds a violent and mystical raider culture, and to its north the tundras give way to the burning and apocalyptic hellscape of the Chaos Wastes. The Norscans that live in closest proximity to this border are the ones most affected by its seeping and ebbing corrupion, their traditions over time changing to closer reflect the designs of the Chaos Gods. These are the Norscans who are considered to be Marauders of Chaos. While southeners may not recognise (or more likely, simply don't care) the difference between the Marauders and the Norscans, it is one that frequently brings the two groups to blows. While both factions agree that raiding the Empire is in their best interests (and indeed this shared interest is likely the only thing holding them back from all-out war) the Norscans resent the Marauders' percieved abandonment of their ancestors' ways and are loathe to accept the Chaotic 'gifts' that so erratically are awarded and taken away. Furthermore the Norscans have always been keen explorers of the world, setting up cultures of their own in places like Nordland (and even in places like Lustria, such as the famous town of Skeggi) and many of them are alarmed to see this aspect gradually disappear, for Marauders seem to have little interest in anything beyond pillage and glory.

Marauders of Chaos live in the harshest conditions of the Old World, and their lives are daily battles for survival against starvation, predation, and attrition. Their only sources of food are from hunting the gigantic Mammoth beasts of the tundra, and their only sources of material wealth are what they can raid from eachother or southeners - the barren Chaos Wastes do not even offer metals to mine. The Marauders that consequentially survive long enough to get any marauding done are hardened warriors clad in little more than pelts and tattoos, and they endlessly strive to win the attention of their patron gods by proving themselves in battle. Some of the more ambitious chieftains lead their warbands south to the Cathayan Borderlands, leaving burned villages and bloody trails in their wake, seeking greater and greater challenges all for the glory of their dark gods.
 


##### Special Rules

#### Eye of the Gods

An aspiring chaos follower is always watched by the vigilant eyes of the dark gods, who reward the successful generously but punish failures harshly. Roll 2D6 after every battle.


Spawn of Chaos: If you lost the preceding battle add +1 to the roll for each of your Heroes that was taken out of action during the battle. On a total of 12 or more the warband’s leader turns into a Chaos spawn (see rules below). His experience, skills, injuries and equipment are lost.

Mark of the Dark Gods: If you won the battle add +1 for every enemy model the leader took out of action. On a total of 12 or more you may choose a Mark of the Dark Gods for the winning leader (see Marks of the Dark Gods below).

As soon as the leader receives a Mark of the Dark Gods through the _Eye of the Gods_ special rule this test is no longer taken. If the warband ever gains a new leader for whatever reason, the new leader automatically gains the _Eye of the Gods_ special rule as they attempt to earn their own mark.

While the Spawn of Chaos entry below says 0-1 that only effects purchased Chaos Spawn. Chaos Spawns generated through failed warband leaders do not count towards this maximum, though their stat lines and behaviours are identical.

The Eye of the Gods rule is not in effect if the warband leader did not take part in the previous battle.


Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the following: Chaotic/Neutral, Chaotic.

A Marauders warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns available to spend. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 15.

## Great Axe
The great axe is the iconic weapon of the Marauders, as adept as tools come for destruction. It functions in the same way as a double-handed weapon, except it also gains the additional _Cutting Edge_ special rule that Axes posess.

## Barbed Whip
The Barbed Whip is a cruel weapon designed to inflict as much suffering as possible over the longest period of time. Beasts whose masters that use these weapons train quickly, for those that do not suffer agonizing and heartless deaths. As long as the wielder is unengaged all allied Warhounds of Chaos within 4" gain +1 attack. This effect does not stack if there are multiple whips within range of the same Warhound. It can only be so motivated! 

##### Heroes

1 Marauder Chieftain
95 gold crowns to hire
The Chieftain is the brutish head of the warband. They leads their tribe in their constant warfare and bloodshed in an attempt to win the approval of their fickle gods. 

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 8 |

Weapons/Armour: A Marauder Chieftain may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Hero Equipment list.

Skills: The Chieftain may learn Combat, Strength, and Speed skills when they gain a new skill.

Special Rules

Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Captain may use their Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership test.

Aspiring Champion: If the Chieftain reaches the final row of experience they earn gain a free suit of Chaos Armour as a gift from their patron gods. Chaos Armour grants a 4+ armour save, does not slow the wearer when combined with a shield, and may never be removed once it is put on.

0-1 Seer
45 gold crowns to hire
A Seer is the Chieftain’s advisor as their god tells them his will through the Seer's visions and dreams. The other tribesmen see the Seer's attunement to their gods as a great gift that is to be equally respected and feared. 

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 8 |

Weapons/Armour: A Seer may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Hero Equipment list.

Skills: The Seer may choose from Combat & Academic when they gain a new skill.

Special rules

Wizard: A Seer is a Wizard and may use magic as determined below. As with all Wizards, upon gaining a new skill they may instead learn a new spell.

Mark of the Dark Gods: When hired the Seer immediately gains a Mark of the Dark Gods. They can have the Mark of the Serpent, the Mark of the Crow, the Mark of the Eagle, the Mark of the Hound, or the Mark of Chaos Undivided.


0-2 Champions
45 gold crowns to hire
Champions are the strongest and most battle hardened warriors in the tribe. They fight constantly waiting for the day when they can finally be judged by their god as being worthy of his service.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |

Weapons/Armour: Champions may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Hero Equipment list. 

Skills: Champions may choose from Combat, Strength, & Speed when they gain a new skill.



0-1 Condemned
55 gold crowns to hire
A servant of a dark god who was foolish enough to turn away from his patron is forever condemned. If the traitor turns to another god for aid then they are often spared death, but suffer a fate many times worse. The servant suffers constant mutations at the hands of their old god but maintains vestiges of his humanity as his new god compensates for the mutations by restoring or altering the form of the servant. It is all in vain, as the unwitting servant eventually becomes a plaything of both gods who use the servant's body and soul as a contest of wills between themselves, completely uncaring of the condemned servant's fate. 


| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4 | D6 | 3 | D6 | D6 | 1 | 4 | D3 | 7 |

Weapons/Armour: The Condemned uses no equipment (see Fate special rule below) but fights without penalties.

Skills: The Condemned may choose from Combat, Strength & Speed when it gains a new skill.

SPECIAL RULES

Inconsistency: The body of the Condemned is mutating permanently. The variable attributes WS, S, T and A are determined whenever needed.

Fear: The Condemned’s unnatural appearance makes him cause fear in his enemies.

Experience: Whenever the Condemned would increase one of its variable attributes the player rolls an appropriate die instead. If the player is satisfied with the result, they may set the attribute on that number (e.g. roll a D6 instead of increasing Strength, on a roll of 4 the player may choose to give the model S 4). Otherwise the Condemned gains a random mutation. Mutations that would alter a stat that has not yet been fixed have no effect - the Condemned's violent contortions simply reshape themselves to acommodate the new shape.

Fate: Once all variable attributes are set the Condemned may use weapons, armour and miscellaneous equipment as usual. However, if they have reached maximum experience and still have unfixed attributes, then their patron could not save them from their former god's wrath and their soul and body are lost. They turns into a terrifying Spawn of Chaos.


##### Henchman

Chaos Marauders
35 gold crowns to hire
Marauders are wild uncivilized barbarians who seek battles and bloodshed. They form the majority of the chieftain’s retinue.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |

Weapons/Armour: Marauders may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Henchmen Equipment list.

0-5 Warhounds of Chaos
15 gold crowns to hire
Warhounds of Chaos are titanic, mastiff-like creatures
which are insanely dangerous in combat. 

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 7 | 4 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 |

Weapons/Armour: None! Apart from their fangs and nasty tempers the Warhounds don’t have weapons and can fight without any penalties. 

Special rules

Animals: Warhounds are animals and never gain experience.





0-1 Chaos Spawn
180 gold crowns to hire
Spawns of Chaos are former Chaos Champions who have been too heavily gifted by their gods and become terrifying mindless monstrosities.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2D6 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 | D6+1 | 10 |

Weapons/Armour: None! Spawns of Chaos fight with claws, tentacles and other extremities. 

Special Rules
Special Attacks: Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.

Fear: Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against nature and cause fear.

Special Movement: The Spawn moves 2D6" straight ahead in each of its Movement phases. Before it does so it’s player may turn it to give the direction. It does not double its movement for charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat.

Unrelenting: Chaos Spawns are impossible to deter, relentlessly attacking until they have reduced their targets to pulp or they themselves stop twitching. It is not unheard of for severed parts of a Chaos Spawn to wriggle about violently on the ground in an effort to attack everything around it for some time after the Spawn has died. The Chaos Spawn is Unbreakable and is also _Immune to Psychology_.

No Brain: Spawns of Chaos are crazed unthinking masses of chaotically writhing flesh and therefore gain no experience.

Large: Spawns of Chaos are Large. 




# Marks of The Dark Gods

The Eye of the Gods special rule may let the warband’s leader choose a Mark of the Dark Gods. With exception to the Mark of Chaos Undivided there may never be two models in the warband with different Marks. Upon being hired Seers choose their Mark when in correspondence with the tribe, granting an audience with their god. A Seer who becomes leader at the same time has to choose the Mark for his associated patron when being rewarded through the Eye of the Gods. 

Heroes may take Marks of Chaos in addition to their Marks of The Dark Gods - though must choose a Mark of Chaos that matches their Mark of The Dark Gods. These are known as Exalted Marks. A Mark of Tchar the Eagle could be combined with a Mark of Tzeentch for example to become an Exalted Mark of Tzeentch - benefitting from both skills in the process.

#### Mark of Darkness.

A Hero with this mark believes in Chaos in its purest blackest form instead of the division into four Chaos Gods, or the four colours of Chaos. 

Leader: All warband members within the leader's leadership radius (6" normally) may re-roll all failed Leadership tests.

Seer: With the Seer of Darkness as the tribe's spiritual leader the warband is able to draw in a much wider array of Marauders to their banner, who will often compete with one another to join. As long as the Seer with the Mark of Darkness remains in your warband Marauder henchmen from this section cost 10 GC less.

A Seer of Darkness uses the spells from Chaos Rituals.

#### Mark of Tchar the Eagle

Tchar the Great Eagle is the Changer of the Ways. He is the Master of the ever-mutating energy known as magic and his followers are skilful practitioners of the arcane arts.

Leader: The Hero is capable of casting spells and immediately learns one random spell from the Tchar Rituals. However, they suffer –1 on all rolls to cast unless they were a wizard before.

Seer: A Seer of Tchar has command of powerful sorcery. The sorcerer starts with two spells from the Tchar Rituals. The first can be chosen freely, the second is randomly determined. 

#### Mark of the Hound

Arkhar the Hound is the God of War. He is worshipped on the battlefield by his warriors who shed blood in his name, charging their enemies with the battle-cry “Blood for the Blood God!”

Leader: The Hero is subject to frenzy from now on. In addition, the Hero gains a 5+ Ward Save against Direct Damage and Magic Missile spells. (If the Mark of Khorne is later taken for the Exalted Mark of Khorne the combined effect is: Frenzy, +1 Attack, 3+ Ward Save against Direct Damage and Magic Missile spells).

Seer: A Seer with the mark of Arkhar counts as a Bloodfather. A Bloodfather is a war-priest and cannot cast spells. Instead he communes with daemons and his almighty deity through visions. Take a Leadership test each time a Bloodfather takes an enemy out of action in hand-to-hand combat. If the test is passed add +1 to the Weapons Skill, Strength, Toughness or Initiative of the war-priest until the end of the battle. Each characteristic can be increased only once in this way.

A Bloodfather may take Strength skills in addition to
those normally available to a Seer. 

#### Mark of Onogal the Crow

Onogal the Crow is the Lord of Decay who unleashes pestilence upon the world. Therefore his followers are almost completely immune to diseases and serious wounds.

Leader: The Hero gets +1 Toughness and may re-roll any Serious Injuries. 

Seer: The Seer uses the Nurgle Rituals, and is immune to poison.

#### Mark of Shornaal the Serpent

Shornaal the Serpent is the Dark Prince of Chaos. The Lord of Pleasure is the patron of all things beautiful and seductive.

Leader: Enemy models that are not immune to psychology cannot attack the Hero in close combat unless they pass a Ld test with 3D6, discarding the lowest D6 result. If the roll is failed, these models are hit automatically in close combat. Once they pass, they do not have to test again for the duration of the battle. Note that the Lizardman’s Cold Blooded special rule cannot be applied to this effect.

Seer: A Seer of Shornaal uses the Shornaal Rituals. If the Seer wasn't taken out of action during the battle, instead of searching for rare items he may indulge their warband in a sickening communal ritual. All warband members in the following battle become _Immune to Psychology_, be it through eagerness for the following ritual or due to nothing phasing them after such a harrowing ordeal.




#### Rituals of Tchar

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Thief's speed | 7 | Augment. | Until the start of the caster's next magic phase their Movement value is increased by 3. |
| 2 | Fool's Gold | 7 | Hex. | With a brief mutter a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it. Nominate a spot within 12" of the caster. All unengaged enemy warband members within 6" of the target area must take a Leadership test. If failed then in their movement phase they will walk D6" towards the target, ending their movement (though they may still shoot as normal). This has no effect on Warriors who are Immune to Psychology, or on animals. |
| 3 | Lucky Guess | 7 | Hex. | The Priest calls out a potentially scathing made-up insult at any enemy whose detection range (usually twice their initiative value) the Priest would be within. The target will gain the Frenzy special rule and Hates the Priest until the end of the battle. | 
| 4 | Whoops! | 4 | Hex.| Whoops! targets a single enemy warrior within 24". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target treats all terrain as Dangerous Terrain. What horrible luck that they should happen to step on that one loose ladder rung, put their foot through that one rotted plank, or that a falling roofslate would happen to land exactly on their head. |
| 5 | What Fortune! | 11 | Augment. | Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers, Priests that ask for direct wealth rarely meet with fortune. Or perhaps knowing that makes this all the riskier? If successfully cast the Priest immediately comes into posession of a Wyrdstone Shard. |
| 6 | Black Cat | 6 | Direct Damage. | The caster may cast Black Cat on every enemy in base contact. As if from nowhere a small feral cat the caster just happened to have befriended earlier leaps from behind the Priest and directly onto the face of their assailants in a flurry of angry claws and fur, inflicting D6 S3 automatic hits on each enemy. Once resolved, the caster may disengage freely from combat D6" in any direction. If the spell fails to cast the cat does still appear, but simply watches in disinterest. |

### Shornaal Rituals

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Delicious Suffering | 7 | Direct Damage. | All models (friend and foe, except for the Seer) within 4"  must pass a Leadership test or are _knocked down_. Has no effect against models that are _Immune to Psychology_. |
| 2 | Dance of the Serpent | 8 | Augment. | Enemy models that are not _Immune to Psychology_ suffer -1 to hit with all attacks at the Seer and any ally within 4" of them. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 3 | Endless Torment | 9 | Direct Damage. | Choose one enemy model within 8”. From now on the model takes a wound in each of its recovery phases on a 4+. For the duration of the Torment the Seer can do nothing else but end the spell at the beginning of their subsequent casting phases, and if the caster is hit the spell will immediately end.  | 
| 4 | Mystify | 7 | Hex.| Target enemy model within 8" will have their Initiative value reduced to 1 and will always strike last in close combat, even if they charge an opponent or are armed with a spear or pike and are charged themselves. This spell lasts until the target passes a Leadership test during their recovery phase.  |
| 5 | Thousand Voices | 8 | Hex | Choose one enemy model within 12”. For the duration of the spell the model reduces it’s Leadership by D3+1 (to a minimum of 2). This spell has no effect on models that are _Immune to Psychology_. At the start of each of their recovery phases the target may attempt a Leadership test. If passed the Hex is removed. Thousand Voices can only be active on one model at a time. |
| 6 | Shornaal's Temptation | 7 | Hex | Choose one enemy model within 8” that is not immune to psychology. The model must then take a Leadership test. If the model fails, then the Seer gains control over the model. The player may attempt to regain control during their Recovery phase by taking another Leadership test. Shornaal's Temptation can only enchant one model at a time. If the Seer is hit whether by a missile or in close combat they must take an immediate Leadership test. If failed, the Hex ends.  |
