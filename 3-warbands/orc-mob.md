#### Orc Mob

Orcs enjoy fighting and looting more than anything else. Because of this, an Orc’s life is spent in constant battle – either
with his fellow Orcs or some other enemy. With its wealth of opponents and loot ready for the taking, Mordheim offers
the perfect opportunity for an aspiring Orc Warboss to prove himself. What follows are complete rules, written by
Mark Havener, for Orc & Goblin warbands.
Among the races of the Warhammer world, none enjoy the
prospect of a good looting more than Orcs and Goblins. For
this reason many Orc warbands have been drawn to the city
of Mordheim and the wyrdstone that lies hidden there. Of
course, Orcs would much rather ambush other warbands and
take their wyrdstone than collect it themselves, but their goals
are the same as any other warband – collect as much treasure
as possible! These traits are reflected in the following special
rules:

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In
any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.

2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Heroes

1 Orc Boss
80 gold crowns to hire
An Orc Boss is a tough and brutal warrior, who will throw his lads
into any fight that he thinks he can profit from. He is the strongest,
toughest and most barbaric member of the warband and if any of his
Boyz think otherwise, the band may soon find itself with one less
member!

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 4 4 4 4 1 3 1 8
Weapons/Armor: An Orc Boss may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Orc equipment list.
Skills: The Orc Boss may choose from Combat, Shooting,
Strength & Speed when he gains a new skill. In addition, the
Orc Boss may choose from the Orc Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Orc Boss may use his
Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.
0-1 Orc Shaman
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc Shamans are outcasts from Orc society. They are gifted by the
Orc gods Gork and Mork with powers they can neither understand
nor completely control. Many join roaming Orc warbands where
they are no longer shunned for their abilities, but respected for
them.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: An Orc Shaman may be armed with
weapons chosen from the Orc equipment list. An Orc
Shaman may never wear armor.
Skills: The Orc Shaman may choose from Strength when he
gains a new skill. In addition, the Orc Shaman may choose
from the Orc Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Magic User: The Orc Shaman has the ability to use magic
and casts spells like any other magicians, and the Orc
Shaman starts with one spells generated at random from the
Waaagh! Magic list. See the Magic section for details. In
addition the Orc Shaman may learn a new Spell instead on a
new skill.

0-3 Orc Big ‘Uns
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc society is a savage hierarchy where only the toughest survive
and rise through the ranks (often atop the bodies of other
challengers). Big ’Uns are such rising stars, and they carry out the
orders of the Orc Boss. If the Boss ever falls, it is up to the Big ’Uns
to decide on a new leader (usually through personal combat).

Weapons/Armor: Big ’Uns may be equipped with
weapons and armor chosen from the Orc equipment list.
Skills: The Orc Big ‘Uns may choose from Combat,
Shooting & Strength when he gains a new skill. In addition,
the Orc Big ‘Uns may choose from the Orc Special Skill list.


##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Goblin Warriors
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins are often used as cannon fodder (as well as a food source in
lean times!) by their larger Orc cousins. They are usually not as
well equipped as Orc Boyz, having to make do with whatever the
Orcs do not want or cannot use.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 2 3 3 3 1 3 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Goblins may be armed with weapons
and armor chosen from Goblin equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Goblin Warriors are subject to the rules for
Animosity (see Special Rules for details). Note: A Goblin
Warrior who fails his Animosity test and rolls a 1 for the
result will never charge an Orc Henchman, though he will
still use any missile weapons to attack as normal. Goblins are
far too afraid of Orcs to challenge them individually.
Not Orcs: Orcs don’t expect much from non-Orcs, and are
therefore not unsettled if Goblins or Cave Squigs break or get
cut down in battle. In fact, they expect as much from these
weaklings! Therefore, when testing to see if an Orc Warband
needs to take a Rout test, each Goblin Warrior or Cave Squig
taken out of action only counts as half a model. Therefore, a
band of 5 Orcs and 10 Goblins (15 models) would only have
to take a test if 4 models fell (4 Orcs or 8 Goblins, or some
combination thereof).
Runts: Goblins may gain experience but if they happen to
roll ‘That Lad’s got talent’ they are immediately killed by
their Orc overlords for becoming too ‘mouthy’ (remove the
Gobbo from the roster).

0-5 Cave Squigs
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins raise the deadly Cave Squigs. These creatures are a curious
blend of animal and fungus, and are composed mostly of teeth,
horns, and a nasty temperament.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Big gob and brutality! Cave Squigs
never use or need weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
a Goblin Warrior, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without a Goblin within 6" at the start of its
Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point on, move
the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each of its
Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact with
another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model in
hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of the
Orc & Goblin player’s control until the end of the game.

Not Orcs: See Goblin Warriors entry for rules.
Animals: Cave Squigs are animals of a sort and so do not
gain experience.
 
Orc Boyz
25 gold crowns to hire
Orc Boyz are savage and tough. They fear nothing that they can get
their bare hands on, though they are even more ignorant and
superstitious than most other beings in the Warhammer world. They
form the core of any Orc warband.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 4 1 2 1 7
Weapons/Armor: Boyz may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Orc equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Orc Boyz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).
 
0-1 Troll
200 gold crowns to hire
Trolls are not intelligent enough to recognize the value of gold, but
large amounts of food can often instill a certain loyalty in them.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armor: Trolls do not require weapons to fight
but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If the warband lacks the gold to pay
the upkeep, the Boss has the option of sacrificing two Goblin
Warriors or Cave Squigs to the Troll in lieu of buying food
(Trolls eat nearly anything). If this fee is not paid (either in
gold or in warband members) the Troll gets hungry and
wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armor saves.
