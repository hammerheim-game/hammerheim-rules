#### Forest-Walker Warbands

Once elves were a common sight in the Old World. After the War of The Beard they decided to leave the Old World and travel
back to Ulthuan but some elves stayed back and settled in the big forests of Bretonnia. Most famous is the wood elf kingdom
of Athel Loren ruled by Orion and Ariel. But the wood elves do not only live in Athel Loren and there are small communities
in most of the large forests of the Empire. On the rare occasions that the Wood Elves willingly enter into discourse with other
races while in search of extremely rare herbs or to check the integrity of magical seals designed to keep intruders from finding
secrets best kept from the prying eyes of the lesser races. But, ever since the appearance event known among men as the
Hammer of Sigmar, (the twin-tailed comet) there have been an increasing number of disturbing rumours that there is a group of
Shadow Dryads in the blasphemous city of Mordheim. Are they the work of Cyanathair, do they belong to the fallen kin of
Coethil or is there a more sinister truth behind these rumours?

##### Forest of Athel Loren

The forest of Athel Loren is typically isolationists, they are
ruled by the demi-gods Orion and Ariel, the King and Queen
of the Woods. Ariel has great sorcerous power and wisdom
beyond mortal ken. With the falling of the comet known
among men as the Hammer of Sigmar, she felt the approach
of a great and evil power; a fallen Chaos lord cast out of the
dark Realms by the other Gods whom it had tried and failed
to destroy. Known to man as Malal, this evil power was now
incarnate on the physical plane and not subject to the
instability that keeps other powers of Chaos somewhat in
check. Ariel saw in her wisdom that the coming of the Lord
of Shadows to the Old World would be a harbinger of dark
times and the beginning of a blight upon the land. It was clear
to her that Malal must be destroyed early or he would grow in
power and spread his poison across the lands. By the time the
Shadowlord turned his eye to Athel Loren he would be too
powerful to stop. Therefore a call went out and the bravest
Wood Elves of the glades of Athel Loren volunteered to
make the dangerous journey across the lands of the men of
the Empire and search out the evil that is Malal and destroy
it.
Special rules
Recruitment: Wood Elves are fewer in number than most of
the other groups staking their claims in Mordheim. To
represent this, it is harder for them to recruit replacements
than other warbands. When a Wood Elven warband wishes to
employ new members, the gold coin cost is paid for all
reinforcements is paid, but the warriors don’t show up
immediately; the new recruits must make the journey from
Athel Loren to Mordheim. Therefore the entire group of
reinforcements will arrive after 1d3 games have passed.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from forest of
Athel Loren receive a bonus of +6 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Forest of Shadows

Before the twin-tailed comet devastated Mordheim the Forest
of Shadows was the home of a magnificent elven settlement
but with the fall of Mordheim horrible beasts and horrors
began to pour out of the city and infiltrate the forest
corrupting the sacred glades. The rumor of the magical
abilities of the Starstone (or wyrdstone as men named it)
spread and the wood elf mages believed that with this power
they could once more restore the balance of the forest and
save the sacred glades that had been corrupted. Thus it was
decided by the elders to send small bands of warriors to
Mordheim to retrieve shards of Starstone.
Special rules
Beast-Hunters: All the Forest-Walker warbands from the
Forest of Shadows Hate Beastmen.
Wardancers: Forest of Shadows warbands may not purchase
Waywatchers, but may instead take two Wardancers.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Forest of
Shadows receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Chaotic / Neutral
##### The Great Forest

It is Said that hidden deep inside the Great Forest of the
Empire, high amount the trees you might find the hidden
village of Wood Elves, they have been hiding ever sines the
War of The Beard. It is also said that some are from an
ancient city which was destroyed by the Dwarves. From the
ruins of this city, the now City of Mordheim stands. It is not
known why, but the Wood Elves of the Great Forest are on
the move. Maybe there is an ancient treasure hidden in the
old Elven Ruins or maybe something even Darker hidden
away down there!
Special rules
Waywatchers: Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest may have an addition Waywatcher, but would lose the
Wardancer.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the

##### Wood Elves Special Rules

Dark Enemies: Forest-Walker warbands may never ally with
Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (see the ‘Multiplayer
Rules for more details on warband alliances). If ally with any
Dwarven warbands (not Hired swords) then both parties will
count as having distrusted alliance even if both Parties have
the same alliance type.
Forest Folks: The Wood Elves spend their entire lives in the
confines of their forest, to represent this all Wood Elves have
the following:
* Wood Elves gain a +1 to Leadership bonus, while in
woodland terrain. (This bonus will not take the
Leadership characteristic above 10)
* Wood Elves can move through woodland terrain without
penalty
* Wood Elves that deploy behind a tree or shrub (or similar
cover) may declare to be hidden from the start of the
battle.
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Wood Elves have learned to stifle their distaste for ‘lesser
races’, and have even been known to work alongside them
from time to time. A Forest-Walker Warband may hire any
Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so no
Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins) or Black power weapons. Also
Forest-Walker Warband will not hire any Dwarven Hired
Swords.
Wood Elf Archery: When using normal Longbows, an extra
6" range and an additional -1 Armour save. Therefore a
standard Longbow has a 36" range and-1 armour saves vs.
normal armour.

with the Forest Spirit special rule:
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Psychology.
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Poison.
