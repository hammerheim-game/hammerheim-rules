# Norse Warbands
</div>

The land of Norsca lies to the far north of the Empire across the stormy Sea of Claws. This is a harsh land of snow and ice with mountains of Frost and Dusk that reach unto the heavens themselves and march right down to the sea.

The lands of Norsca offer very little to their inhabitants, and those that dwell there subsist almost wholly upon the bounties of raiding expeditions to the south. As a result a Warrior-culture of brigandage has universal sway among the Norse, their men and women typically fair-haired with powerful builds. They have a rich history and revere the actions of their ancestors, for it is only by their guidance that they are able to eke out an existance in the frigid glaciers, though very little of their history is recorded - instead told and retold through folklore. Many a time their dreaded longships have brought terror and destruction to the lands of men and the other races, with tales of heroism on the high seas inspiring future generations of raiders. 

The Norse people live in marauding tribes or clans much like the Unberogens who were, centuries earlier, the founders of the Empire. It is for this reason that the Norse are seen as a very primitive and uncivilised race by others, though their homeland has allowed them scant resources to develop a nation. All Norse warriors are trained in the art of war at a very young age and become skilled in the use of sword, axe and shield for theirs is a brutal society where only the strongest survive.

Probably because of their well founded and fearsome reputation the Norse have few allegiances apart from to their clan and their ancestors, and so make excellent mercenaries. While they lack the efficiency of strategy and the advancement of arms of a regimented Empire Mercenary warband they make up for it in ferocity and affordability. Despite their brutish behaviour the Norse make superb natural sailors rivalling even the High Elves and it was indeed the Norse who were the first humans to discover Lustria and the South Lands, settling there to form the city of Skeggi.

It is unusual to see Norse venture further inland, for their specialties lie in coastal raiding and naval combat above all else. Warriors from the continent of Norsca that make the trip are typically the Dark God-worshippers from the Chaos Wastes, and these countrymen are held in bitter emnity by the other Norscans. Their culture is in a constant state of erosion as more and more clans embrace Chaos' corrupting influences, and Empire settlements have on occasion found themselves saved from Marauder invasions by reinforcing Norse warbands only to have their saviors extort and raid vast fortunes from them.

### Special Rules
**Countercharge:** While many races do not shy away from combat most at least have the common sense to brace for impact when foes bear down upon them, widening their guard and raising their shields. Norse have a slightly different approach however, often surprising their foes by charging straight into their attackers for a concussive head-on collision. Unengaged humans in a Norse warband may take a Leadership test whenever a charge is declared against them. If failed nothing happens and the charge is resolved as normal.

If passed then the Norscan is moved 4+D6" towards their attacker using the Random Movement rules, stopping 1" away if that move would take them into combat. The attacker then resolves their charge as normal, and in that combat phase both warriors count as having charged (so they will both benefit from weapons and skills that give bonuses during a charge, and will both strike first - most likely meaning combat will be resolved in Initiative order.) 
**Seafarers:** Humans in the Norse warband are as at home in water as they are on land. They do not consider water to be Difficult Terrain. 
**Resents Chaos:** While the warband may choose to be Neutral/Chaotic they may never choose to gain a Mark of Chaos upon gaining a skill advance.   
**Alignment:** The Warband's Alignment may be either Neutral, or Neutral/Chaotic.

### Heroes

#### **1  Jarl**
80 gold crowns to hire. 
_The Jarl of a Norse Warband is the most battle hardened veteran of their group and often a lesser clan chieftain of their tribe. They have seen many battles and are used to the bloodshed. While some Jarls choose to command their forces with strategy, most just run into the fray with the rest of the warriors. However the Jarl decides to run their Warband, all of the other warriors respect them and look up to them._
