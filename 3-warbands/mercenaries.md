# Mercenaries
</div>


This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For warriors-for-hire these are good times! Since the discovery of wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for aspirational Mercenary warbands from all over the Empire. 

The Empire is fairly unique in the way it views mercenaries. For most races in The Old World the prospect of selling your sword to the highest bidder varies from unthinkable, in the case of cultures with a reverence for honourable combat, to bizarre and unnecessary in the case of the darker factions of the world where the rewards are from claiming spoils of battle rather than the promise of participation. In the Empire however being a Mercenary is a pivotal and well-respected line of work, often viewed less as cut-throat sellswording and more as professional soldiery.

Mercenaries take great pride in their work, and it is extremely uncommon (as well as bad business) for a Mercenary warband to turn on its employer. They maintain their own arms and armour, and learn a great deal as they journey the land - discovering cultures and tactics as they go. As a result Mercenaries are often the most worldly among humans, and while ill-educated they are far less prone to the superstitions of those who have spent all their lives within one nation. Indeed many nations have come to depend upon the loyalty of Mercenaries more than their standing armies - for armies are at the whims of their local Nobles, who often have their own ambitions.

With the annihilation of Mordheim times have never been so good for a budding entourage of Mercenaries. Nobles, merchants, and even the Temple of Sigmar itself all offer rich rewards for the Wyrdstone within the ruins. Foremost among the patrons of Mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders for the Emperor's throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg - favourite of the merchant guilds. 

Each of them has offered tremendous rewards for Wyrdstone retrieved, and even bounties on the heads of particularly successful leaders of warbands working for rival factions.

### Mercenary Special Rules
**Background:** When drawing up your roster for your Mercenaries warband you may pick from one of the three following factions. This represents the origin of your Mercenary warband, and will confer various bonuses accordingly in addition to the ones listed in this section.   







## Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (or so Siegfried, the ruler of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric. 

Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and practical wargear, with the exception that their officers will  usually wear resplentently plumed wide-brimmed hats and bear the most charismatic and oversized moustaches to ensure their soldiers can identify them (and perhaps more importantly, know when they are being watched). In battle they often wear coloured ribbons as marks of identification or authority. 

They are justly proud of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.

##### Special Rules
**Professionals:** Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty between officers and men. To represent this, all Reikland heroes gain +1 Leadership. 
**Lead by Example:** Officers among Reikland warbands are well aware of 
the influence their decisions have upon their soldiers. All Reikland Heroes gain the _Leader_ special rule and access to Academic skills. It is still worth clarifying who the actual leader is though for the purposes of post-battle experience.  
**Clerics:** Reikland Clerics may be dedicated either to Shallya (Prayers of Shallya), or Sigmar (Prayers of Sigmar).   
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful/Neutral or Neutral.

## Middenheim
Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as the City of the White Wolf in reference to Ulric, the old god of wolves and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the city. 

The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and  Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers and the Temple of Sigmar.

Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies howling their brutal battle-cries.

##### Special Rules
**Powerful Build:** Middenheimers are famous for their physical prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the Champions, Clerics, and Captains of a Middenheim warband start with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.   
**Clerics:** Middenheim Clerics may be dedicated either to Ulric (Prayers of Ulric), or Taal (Prayers of Taal). 
**Alignment:** the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful, Lawful/Neutral, or Neutral.

## Marienburg

Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the east. 

The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit. Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in Marienburg, most important of all being the secretive High Order of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of men feel themselves shackled by the old order of The Empire and are eager to seize increasing power for themselves.

Their champion for the Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire, all the minor Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown her that denied Marienburg the throne, driving a wedge between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar. 

Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has earned them grudging respect. Many old Nordland laws, such as the settling of disputes by duels, have continued in Marienburg after its independence - though it has drastically evolved since then. While Nordlander duels are fought by the aggrieved parties, often with days of showboating and rabblerousing in advance to build spectator support, Marienburg duels are often private affairs conducted between two nominated champions.

The market for induviduals skilled in one-to-one combat is substantial, and as duels are conducted with either pistol or sword, those who ply their trade as champions-for-hire become extremely comfortable with both. While in far away Tilea this has become a romanticised ideal that has shaped their entire culture, the reality in Marienburg is that duellists' patrons are unscrupulous merchants who are more than willing to tip the scales in their favour using clandestine means. Nobody is keen to explain quite why the market for poisons and performance-enhancing potions is as burgeoning as it is in Marienburg.

##### Special Rules
**Duellists:** Marienburg humans do not suffer the usual Weapon Skill penalty of using two weapons when using any combination of Pistols, Duelling Pistols, or Swords.  
**Clerics:** Marienburg Clerics may be dedicated to either Ranald (Prayers of Ranald), Shallya (Prayers of Shallya), or Morr (Funerary Rites).  
**Financial Backing:** Marienburg warbands start with 600 gold crowns to spend, rather than the usual 500.  
**Alignment:** Marienburg has an infamous reputation among the
Empire for their fluid and merchantile whims, and their ethical 
flexibility is unrivaled by their more scrupulous
neighbours. As a result Marienburg may change their alignment during
any post-game phase, and may choose any alignment they wish.
