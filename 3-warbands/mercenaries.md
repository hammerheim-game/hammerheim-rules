#### Mercenaries

This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For
warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of
wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men
from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple
of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders
for the Emperor’s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the
Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three
contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are fighting for.
Warbands from different places will vary in many respects,
offering different benefits as well as having a unique
appearance and character.

##### Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is
Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the
Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of
Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the
Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler
of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the
throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed
to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional
warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders
disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and
practical wargear, with the exception that their officers will 
usually wear resplentently plumed wide-brim hats to ensure their
soldiers can identify them (and perhaps more importantly, know when they
are being watched). In battle they often wear coloured ribbons
as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud
of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and
contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they
sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.
Special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of
military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty
between officers and men. To represent this, Reikland warbands'
_Leader_ ability is increased by 6", stacking with other skills
or effects.
Furthermore officers among Reikland warbands are well aware of 
the influence their decisions have upon their soldiers. All
human heroes in Reikland warbands gain the _Stubborn_ rule.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Middenheim

Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by
dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as
the City of the White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves
and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the
city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and

Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of
Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief
contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has
always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers
and the Temple of Sigmar.
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a
well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts
which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain
a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are
famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into
battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons
of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look
especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies
howling their brutal battle-cries.
Special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the
Champions and Captains of a Middenheim warband start
with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Marienburg

Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in
the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which alone
conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling
cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array
of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven
kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the
east. The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to
man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg
there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit.
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High Order
of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst
mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of
men feel themselves shackled by the old order and are eager
to seize power for themselves. Their champion for the
Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen
influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s
claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown
her that denied Marienburg the throne driving a wedge
between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and
armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish
and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has
earned them grudging respect. Their chief skills lie in
duelling and in the use of poisons and other clandestine
fighting methods. Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and
wear jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather coats,
bandanas and short swords that are easy to conceal.
Special rules

To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start off with
an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when fighting in a
campaign.
Furthermore the culture of duelling to settle disputes has
inculcated all Marienburgers with an extreme comfort with 
pistols and swords. Marienburg humans do not suffer the usual
penalty for using two weapons when using any combination of
Pistols, Duelling Pistols, or Swords. However they have also
learned not to fight fair! Marienburg warbands treat all items
from the Miscellaneous Equipment section as Common.

Alignment: Marienburg has an infamous reputation among the
Empire for their fluid and merchantile whims, their ethical 
flexibility unrivaled by their more hard-line 'us and them'
neighbours. As a result Marienburg may change their alignment during
any post-game phase, and may choose any alignment they wish.

##### Heroes

1 Mercenary Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
A Mercenary Captain is a tough professional warrior, a man who
will fight for anyone or against anything so long as the price is
right. Mordheim offers such a man the chance to become rich
beyond his dreams, though at great risk. But as ruthlessness and
lack of mercy and pity are the hallmarks of a successful Mercenary
Captain, it is no wonder that they flock to Mordheim.

Champions (or berserkers, first swordsmen and various other

and, after the Captain, they get the pick of any equipment and loot.

varying from the belligerent Warrior-Priests of Ulric to the mischevous
and magpie-like Priests of Ranald, to the devout healers of Shallaya.
