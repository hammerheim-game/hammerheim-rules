#### Lahmian Warband

Long ago, the nobles of Lahmia stole the secret of the elixir of eternal life from the Great Necromancer, Nagash, during the
war in which he was expelled from the land of Nehekhara. Over time, corrupted by the secret they had stolen, they became the
first true vampires and were themselves driven out. Banished from their ancestral home, the Lahmians became mistresses of
seduction and cunning, indulging their hedonistic appetites through manipulation of lesser wills. Of all the great vampire
bloodlines, the Lahmians above all have become most adept at exploiting that great weakness of humanity, the desire for love,
power and an escape from death. Their poor, deluded followers do their bidding by night and protect them by day. Their
interest in humanity (if interest is the right word to use of what are, after all, merely instruments and playthings) has made
them strong. Now, centuries after they were dispossessed, Nehekhara is once again a land of the dead, and the Lahmian
vampires have returned from the Northlands to reclaim their own. In the North, they have learned how to bend humans to their
will. In their ancestral home they have older, more faithful servants who, dormant through the centuries, have awaited their
return.

##### Special Rules

Blood Successor: Unlike the Vampire warband, Lahmia
warbands may not recruit a new vampire if the warband
contains a Blood Sister. Instead, if the Lahmia is slain then
the Blood Sister may transform into a Vampire during the
post-battle experience phase. Until that happens the surviving
human henchmen with highest leadership (or, in the case of a
tie, the most experience) will assume leadership of the
warband until the Blood Sister transforms. If the warband
does not contain a Blood Sister then leadership is allocated as
above and a new vampire may be recruited after the next
battle. If during the post-battle phase the warband contains
neither a vampire nor a necromancer either because they have
been killed or never recruited, then any skeletons and wight
henchmen in the warband are lost as the magic which
sustains them is dispelled.
Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Mistresses
and their undead minions. The human members of an Lahmia
warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in
their own warband, i.e: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc.
Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

You have 500gc to recruit and equip your initial warband.

##### Heroes

1 Lahmia Vampire
110 gold crowns to hire
Beautiful yet deadly, these seductive mistresses of undeath stalk the
halls of their long-lost homes, searching for who knows what?
Perhaps some far-off recollection of their long-vanished years
walking in the sunlight and the joy of life...
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: Lahmia Vampire may be armed with
weapons and armor chosen from the Lahmia Equipment list.
Skills: The Lahmia Vampire may choose from Combat,
Academic, Strength & Speed when she gains a new skill. In
addition, the Lahmia Vampire may choose from the Lahmia
Special Skill list.
Special Rules
Leader: Any models in the warband within 6" of the Lahmia
Vampire may use his Leadership instead of their own.
Cause Fear: Vampires are terrifying Undead creatures and
therefore cause fear.
Immune to Psychology: Vampires are not affected by
psychology (such as fear) and never leave combat.
Immune to Poison: Vampires are not affected by any
poison.
No Pain: Vampires treat a ‘stunned’ result on the Injury chart
as ‘knocked down’.
Local Knowledge: The Lahmias have long memories of their
ancestral homeland, Khemrian. While is Khemri setting the
Lahmia vampire of a Lahmia warband may reroll one dice in
the exploration phase.

0-1 Necromancer
35 gold crowns to hire
These peddlers of undeath are not greatly liked by the hedonistic
Lahmians - they are ugly and morbid - but they have their uses...

from the Necromantic Magic list. See the Magic section for
details. In addition the Necromancers may learn a new Spell
instead on a new skill.

0-3 Thrall
20 gold crowns to hire
Lahmian vampires are nobility, and all nobility require servants.
Fanatically loyal, these humans are blindly in love with their dark
mistress...
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: Dregs may be armed with weapons and
armor chosen from the Lahmia Equipment list.
Skills: The Dreg may choose from Combat, Strength &
Speed when he gains a new skill.
Special Rules
Devoted: The Thralls is completely enraptured by the
Lahmia. If she is knocked down in close combat (i.e: rolls a
stunned or knocked down result on the injuries chart) the
Thralls will become frenzied and immediately take the most
direct route to her aid, attacking any model within 2" either
side of a direct line to the Lahmia. If the vampire is taken out
of action, the Beloved will immediately hate the model who
did the damage and attempt to kill them at the earliest
opportunity. The beloved will remain frenzied until the hated
enemy is slain.
Favoured: If the Lahmia's Beloved is killed, she may choose
one of her Thralls to replace him by granting him the Blood
Kiss at his next advance. If this option is taken the Thralls'
leadership is increased to 8 if not already so and he takes the
place of the Beloved in the warband's roster. The Thrall's
elevation to Beloved counts instead of any advance he may
be entitled to. A new Thrall may be recruited after the
warband's next battle.


0-1 Blood Sister
40 gold crowns to hire
Lahmian vampires are solitary creatures, but the preservation of the
bloodline is a priority for them. Young maidens are carefully
selected by Lahmians to receive the gift of eternal youth and trained
in the ways of the Lahmia, ready to take their mistress' place if she
should be destroyed. These girls stand on the boundary of life and
death. Not fully undead, but no longer wholly human...

Weapons/Armor: Blood Sisters may be armed with
weapons and armor chosen from the Lahmia Equipment list.
Skills: The Blood Sisters may choose from Combat,
Academic, Strength & Speed when she gains a new skill. In
addition, the Blood Sisters may choose from the Lahmia
Special Skill list.
Special Rules:
Hardened: Blood Sisters are accustomed to the ways of
undead. Hence they are immune to fear and never test for
being all alone.
Demi-Vampires: If the warband's Lahmia is killed, the
Blood Sister may take her place. At her next advance she will
become a vampire on a roll of 4+ on a d6. This counts instead
of the advance. The blood Sister retains her existing skills
and experience but the usual rules for undead apply
immediately and her maximum stats become those of a
vampire. If the Blood Sister fails to transform, roll again at
her next and all subsequent advances. Once a Blood Sister
has become a vampire a new Blood Sister may be recruited
into the warband after the next game.

0-1 Beloved
Lahmians are attracted to mortals of strong will and strong body.
Their seduction gives the vampires a special pleasure, and their
martial skills are evermore devoted to the will of their dark mistress.
Until, that is, she grows tired of them or finds a more interesting
lover...
Beloved: The Beloved maybe chosen from any hero in a
human warband other then Middenheim, Witch Hunters,
Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed, Carnival of Chaos and any hero
that uses prays. The Beloved will keep the same cost, profile,
skill list, special rules and starting Experience. Weapons &
Armor will be chosen from his Wargear list and the skill
leader is lost, as if hired by his normal warband.
Special Rules:
Devoted: the beloved is completely enraptured by the
Lahmia. If she is knocked down in close combat (i.e: rolls a
stunned or knocked down result on the injuries chart) the
Beloved will become frenzied and immediately take the most
direct route to her aid, attacking any model within 2" either
side of a direct line to the Lahmia. If the vampire is taken out
of action, the Beloved will immediately hate the model who
did the damage and attempt to kill them at the earliest
opportunity. The beloved will remain frenzied until the hated
enemy is slain.
