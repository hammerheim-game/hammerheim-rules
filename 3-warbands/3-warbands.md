### Starting a Warband

Before you begin to play you must recruit a warband to take part in the battle for Mordheim. In this section of the book we take a detailed look at each of the warbands and provide the information you need to recruit a warband of that type.

Use the lists that follow to recruit and equip your warband (an example warband has been included at the back of the book.) You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model and their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount of money. As you make your choices, subtract the money you have “spent” from your total until you have bought all you can. Any unspent gold crowns are put into the warband’s treasury and can be used later or hoarded to buy something more expensive. 

To start with you must recruit at least three warriors including a leader. The weapons, armor and mutations you choose for your warriors must be represented on the models themselves. The exceptions are knives and daggers, which you may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing if not represented on the model.

#### Skill tables and starting experience

The warband lists also include information about the starting experience of the warriors and which skills they can choose as they progress in the game. Some warbands also include separate skill lists unique to the warband. 

The rules about experience and skills will be fully explained in the Campaign section, so don’t worry about them for now.

#### Heroes and henchmen

For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.

##### Heroes

These are exceptional individuals who have the potential to
become legends. Heroes can be armed and equipped
individually and may carry any special equipment they might
pick up during the campaign.

###### Leader

Every warband must have a leader. He represents you, the
player. He makes the decisions and leads your warriors
through the dark streets of Mordheim.

###### Other heroes

Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to five
other Heroes, who form the core of your warband. A warband
may never include more Heroes of any specific type than the
number given in the Warband list. This means that some
warbands can only get the maximum of six Heroes by
gaining experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).

##### Henchmen

Henchmen typically fall into two groups: those that gain experience, and those that don't. 

Most henchman, such as the Brethren of the Possessed, Skaven Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen, do gain experience. These Henchmen gain experience from battle and random events, and become better as time goes by.

The other type of Henchmen are those such as War hounds and Zombies. These are too dim or too primitive to gain experience.

Henchmen may never use any special equipment you acquire during their adventures (unless otherwise noted); only Heroes may do so. Henchmen can include potentially powerful warriors, but Heroes always have an edge over them with their potential to gain extra experience.

All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group, which usually consists of between one and five individuals. Henchmen groups gain experience collectively and gain advances together.

#### Weapons and armor

Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two close combat weapons (or one two-handed weapon), a single missile weapon, and any armor chosen from the appropriate list. For these purposes, a brace of pistols counts as a single missile weapon. Warriors may be restricted in regard to which types of weapons they can use. The warband’s equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and armor when starting a warband, as indicated by the list in the warband’s entry, but after playing the first game the only way to get further rare weapons and armor is to roll to see if you can locate them (see the Trading section).

You may buy additional equipment between battles, but your warriors can only use the weapons and armor listed in their warband entry. As they accumulate experience and gain skills, Heroes may learn to use weapons other than those initially available to them.

Every model in each Henchman group must be armed and armored in the same way. This means that if your Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy them swords, you must buy four swords.

#### Warband roster

You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of
your warband. Blank roster sheets can be found printed at the
back of this book, one for Heroes and one for Henchman
groups. We suggest that you photocopy or copy as many
sheets as you need, so that you can keep a neat and accurate
record of your warband as it changes from game to game.
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and
write down the details of each Hero and Henchman group in
the appropriate places. You’ll notice that Heroes and
Henchmen have slightly different spaces provided to reflect
the different ways in which they gain experience and use
weapons, armor and equipment.
It is a good idea to work out the warband on a piece of scrap
paper first, as you will have to juggle the weapons and
fighters to get as close to the maximum permitted value of the
warband as possible. If you have any cash left after choosing
your warband write this down in the space marked as
‘Treasury’. 

The warband roster is a record of your 'brave' group of
warriors and is useful to keep beside you as you play. During
a battle you may wish to make notes on the sheet itself, to
record details such as extra experience, equipment used, etc.
You will need to give your warband a name, and also name
all your Heroes and each Henchman group. It’s up to you to
invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of
inspiration throughout this book.


#### Ready for battle

The warband is now ready to start its fighting career!


### Warbands

#### Mercenaries

This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For
warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of
wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men
from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple
of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders
for the Emperor’s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the
Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three
contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are fighting for.
Warbands from different places will vary in many respects,
offering different benefits as well as having a unique
appearance and character.

##### Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is
Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the
Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of
Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the
Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler
of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the
throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed
to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional
warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders
disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and
practical wargear, with the exception that their officers will 
usually wear resplentently plumed wide-brim hats to ensure their
soldiers can identify them (and perhaps more importantly, know when they
are being watched). In battle they often wear coloured ribbons
as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud
of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and
contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they
sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.
Special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of
military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty
between officers and men. To represent this, Reikland warbands'
_Leader_ ability is increased by 6", stacking with other skills
or effects.
Furthermore officers among Reikland warbands are well aware of 
the influence their decisions have upon their soldiers. All
human heroes in Reikland warbands gain the _Stubborn_ rule.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Middenheim

Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by
dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as
the City of the White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves
and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the
city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and

Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of
Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief
contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has
always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers
and the Temple of Sigmar.
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a
well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts
which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain
a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are
famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into
battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons
of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look
especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies
howling their brutal battle-cries.
Special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the
Champions and Captains of a Middenheim warband start
with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
