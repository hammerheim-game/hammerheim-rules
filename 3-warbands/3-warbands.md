## Starting a Warband

In this section of the book we take a detailed look at each of
the warbands and provide the information you need to recruit
a warband of that type.

Use the lists that follow to recruit and equip your warband. You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model and
their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount
of money. As you make your choices, subtract the money you
have “spent” from your total until you have bought all you
can. Any unspent gold crowns are put into the warband’s
treasury and can be used later or hoarded to buy something
more expensive.

To start with you must recruit at least three warriors
including a leader. The weapons, armour and mutations you
choose for your warriors must be represented on the models
themselves. The exceptions are knives and daggers, which
you may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing
if not represented on the model.


### Skill tables and starting experience
The warband lists also include information about the starting
experience of the warriors and which skills they can choose
as they progress in the game. Some warbands also include
separate skill lists unique to the warband.

The rules about experience and skills will be fully explained
in the Campaign section, so don’t worry about them for now.

### Heroes and Henchmen
For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.
Heroes
These are exceptional individuals who have the potential to
become legends. Heroes can be armed and equipped
individually and may carry any special equipment they might
pick up during the campaign.

### Leader
Every warband must have a leader. These characters might be nobles recruiting a gang of mercenaries, or powerful vampires with their throng of servants. They are often highly charismatic or powerful induviduals.

### Other heroes
Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to five
other Heroes, who form the core of your warband. A warband
may never include more Heroes of any specific type than the
number given in the Warband list. This means that some
warbands can only get the maximum of six Heroes by
gaining experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).

### Henchmen
Henchmen typically fall into two groups. There are
Henchmen such as the Brethren of the Possessed, Skaven
Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen. These Henchmen
gain experience and become better as time goes by. They are
bought in groups of one to nine models. 

The other type of Henchmen are those such as War hounds
and Zombies. These are too dim or too primitive to gain
experience.
Henchmen may never use any special equipment you acquire
during their adventures (unless otherwise noted); only Heroes
may do so. Henchmen can include potentially powerful
warriors, but Heroes always have an edge over them with
their potential to gain extra experience.

All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group, which usually
consists of between one and five individuals. Henchmen
groups gain experience collectively and gain advances
together. 

### Weapons and armour
Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two close
combat weapons (or a single two-handed weapon) as well as their starting dagger, a single missile weapon and any armour chosen from the
appropriate list. For these purposes, a brace of pistols counts
as a single missile weapon. Warriors may be restricted in
regard to which types of weapons they can use. The
warband’s equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is
available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and armour
when starting a warband, as indicated by the list in the
warband’s entry, but after playing the first game the only way
to get further rare weapons and armour is to roll to see if you
can locate them (see the Trading section).

You may buy additional equipment between battles, but your
warriors can only use the weapons and armour listed in their
warband entry. As they accumulate experience and gain
skills, Heroes may learn to use weapons other than those
initially available to them.

Every model in each Henchman group must be armed and
armoured in the same way. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.

### Warband roster
You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of
your warband. 
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and
write down the details of each Hero and Henchman group in
the appropriate places. You’ll notice that Heroes and
Henchmen have slightly different spaces provided to reflect
the different ways in which they gain experience and use
weapons, armour and equipment.
