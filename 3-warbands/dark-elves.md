#### Dark Elf Warband

Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High
Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are
better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure
have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave
destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly
feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted
forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark
Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for
this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves.
The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in
their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark
God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the
Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting
pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.
Despite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled
as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It
is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that
bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in
their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark
Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to
the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands
don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.

##### Special Rules

Kindred Hatred: The Dark Elves have been fighting the
High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two
races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves
Hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf Hired Swords.

Excellent Sight: There are numerous legends detailing the
excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin.
Elves can spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away than
normal warriors. (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches)

powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and
unreliable.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Heroes

Dark Elf Leaders are typically drawn from the Dark Elf nobility and

bring home to Naggaroth. They are cold and ruthless killers and
they command the respect of their troops through assassination and
terror. They have attained their position of leadership by
eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their
remarkable cunning, they are dangerous foes who embody the
merciless traits of the Druchii race.

Griffons and other noble creatures their malevolent kin have
infamous Beastmasters, Dark Elves of particularly cruel renown

the Dark Elf race are female. It is rumoured that any males who do

immediately put to death to fulfil some dark prophecy. Dark Elf
Sorceresses are mysterious, raven haired beauties who are

services are high in demand.

of the Corsairs – the Black Ark Raiders. They are skilled with sword
and axe, as well as the repeater crossbow, the distinct missile
weapon of the Dark Elves. Whenever a Black Ark explores the coast
of Lustria the Corsairs are the first to launch raiding parties.

are not heroes.

0-5 Shades
30 Gold Crowns to hire
The stealthy Dark Elf Scouts rely on their repeater crossbows to
harass and snipe at the enemy, rather than engaging them head on
as ambush is the preferred style of fighting. Shades are young and
inexperienced scouts that see the expeditions to Lustria as a
valuable training opportunity.

Weapons/Armor: Shades may be armed with weapons and
armor chosen from the Shades Equipment list.

is the art of moving without being seen or heard. If a Dark Elf
is Hiding, enemy models suffer -1 to their Initiative value for
determining if they can detect him.

0-2 Cold One Beasthounds
30 Gold Crowns to hire
The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. One such animal was
discovered in Lustria. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beasthound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beasthounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beasthound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 0 4 4 1 1 1 4
Weapons/Armor: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and
do not need any weapons save their claws and massive jaws.
Special Rules
Animals: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and all animal
rules apply to them, they never gain experience.
Beastmaster: Cold One Beasthounds are nasty viscous
brutes that are barely kept under control. If the Beastmaster
dies the beasts will immediately escape from the warband and
they are removed from the warband roster. If the Beastmaster
is unable to participate in a battle, then neither will the beasts.
Stupidity: Cold One Beasthounds may use the basic
Leadership of the Beastmaster if they are within 6" of him.
They may never use the Leadership of the warband leader,
nor may they benefit from the Beastmaster’s increased
Leadership if he is within 6" of the leader.
Scaly Skin: Cold One Beasthounds have tough scaly skin,
and are considered to have a 6+ armor save. This save
cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.
Fear: Cold One Beasthounds cause Fear.
