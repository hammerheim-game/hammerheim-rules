# High Elf Loremasters
</div>

Far from the western coast of the Empire lies the Elven kingdom of Ulthuan, very possibly the most important place in the world - a fact its denziens are well aware of. It is the home of the Great Vortex, an almost unimaginably vast conjuration that drains the magic from the world - thus preventing it from oversaturating the planet and allowing an otherwise apocalyptic quantity of demons into existence.

The kingdom of Ulthuan is inhabited by the High Elves, known to themselves as Asur, the most proud and affluent of their kind. No other people have the same sense of paramountcy as the Elves; and while in Dark Elves it is manifested in the selfish belief that the world exists for their pleasures and vice, and in Wood Elves the world is so trivial as to not be worth leaving the forests for, the High Elves view the world's inhabitants as misbehaving children in need of protection. They believe themselves to be the sole guardians against the forces of Chaos, for only they are uncorruptable and above scrutiny.

While the High Elves consider themselves to be the defenders of the world, that calling doesn't necessarily extend to the protection of other races. Only a relative handful of High Elves see the lesser races as something worth protecting - and even they believe that these races must be saved from themselves. The rest, at their most generous, consider them an extra (and entirely sacrificial) wall of defence with which to preserve Ulthuan.

Ulthuan itself is the land that Bretonnia wishes it could be - wealthy beyond all reason (indeed, trade is conducted by the High Elves only as a means by which to plant agents around the world rather than out of any necessity). Its lands are verdant and green, with mountains inhabited by regal dragons and eagles, and the spires of their cities are so plentiful that they appear as glittering white forests on the horizon. The armouries of Ulthuan are said to store more magical weapons than there are Asur to wield them, and it was their absolute mastery of magic that saved the world.

Study of Magic is thus more widespread among Asur than any other culture, and their wizards are without rival. The greatest of these scholars become Loremasters, ancient Elves who breathe the Winds of Magic as unconsciously as they do air. They travel the world in the constant quest for knowledge, often accompanied by impeccably-equipped retinues of elite militia or glittering swordmasters.

Word of Mordheim's destruction and the magical properties of the Wyrdstone left behind reached Ulthuan even before much of the Empire, so effective is their network of spies. With such powerful corruptive energy so easily accessible, concern about just what the shortsighted humans might do with it spread quickly, and scholarly expeditions of Loremasters set out to assess the situation.









### Special Rules
**Kindred Hatred:** High Elves hate all Dark Elves. 
**Black Powder Weapons:** High Elves Elves may never use black powder weapons. They are too noxious and leave residue on their clothes that is too difficult to clean.  
**Eyes Everywhere:** The Asur have spies all across the world, so there is little that escapes their attention. So precious is their time that they rarely go on excursions without certainty of reward. When determining the contents of a chest (such as in the Raven Barracks scenario), High Elves may choose their reward instead of rolling. Additionally in scenarios with a table of rewards (such as the Wizard's Mansion), the difficulty in obtaining all rewards is decreased by 1. 
**Alignment:** the Warbandâ€™s Alignment is Lawful, or Lawful/Neutral.

> ### Hoeth Greatsword  
_The Hoeth Greatsword is a magnificently glimmering weapon nearly as long as an Elf is tall, yet so perfectly balanced that, to a warrior skilled in its use, it seems as light as a feather. So keen is the Greatsword's edge, and so enduring are the enchantments woven into its blade, that its sharpness is never dulled._ 
> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +2    
**Special Rules:** Parry, Armour Piercing, Requires Two Hands.

### Heroes

#### **1 Loremaster**
125 gold crowns to hire.    
_Even amongst the rarified ranks of the Asur, it is unusual to find an intellect capable of mastering an entire path, let alone show accomplishment in several. Such is the achievement that marks out a Loremaster from a mere scholar. To these towering intellects even the exacting disciplines of the Swordmasters are almost childishly easy to master, and they are invariably as gifted as warriors as they are as wizards._

#### **0-4 Swordmasters**
60 gold crowns to hire  
_Swordmasters are warriors that have studied warfare and personal combat for decades, or even centuries. The blur of combat is considered an art form to these masters, using their incredible Elven speed and hightened senses to regularly perform feats of fable._

#### 0-2 Scholars
55 gold crowns to hire  
_Scholars are students under the tutelage of the Loremaster, though are fearsome wizards in their own right. They are some way towards their goal of magical mastery, though lack the martial prowess of their leader._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 8 |

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Scholars may choose equipment from the Asur Equipment List.     
**Skills:** Scholars may choose from Academic, Speed, and High Elf Special Skills.

##### Special Rules

**Magic User:** Scholars use spells from High Magic.


### Henchmen


#### Militia
35 gold crowns to hire  
_Militia are typically thought of as a hastily-assembled rabble of commoners, thrust into warfare with little more training than an instruction to face forward and raise spears. The Asur however maintain strict laws to ensure all able-bodied Elves are capable fighters, with even the most 'humble' of citizens able to challenge hardened veterans in single combat. These militia are rarely levied unless necessary however, for the Asur are in decline and every Elven life lost is profoundly mourned._

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Militia may choose equipment from the Asur Equipment List.



#### 0-3 Agents
35 Gold Crowns  
_Agents come in all shapes and sizes, though often are humans lured by the prospect of Asur wealth. The High Elves are discreet employers with deep pockets, and only those capable of keeping their mouths shut will ever even be made aware of their employment opportunities._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |

___
**Weapons/Armour:** Agents may choose equipment from the Asur Equipment List.

##### Special Rules
**Infiltration:** Agents automatically have the _Infiltration_ skill. See Assassin skills.
