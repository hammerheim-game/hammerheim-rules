#### Ostermark

Ostermark is the Easternmost city of the Empire and home to Mordheim,
the city that was once its capitol. Of all the countries of the Empire
the Ostermarks were perhaps the best psychologically equipped to deal
with its calamatous loss, for death plays a large part in Ostermark
culture. Their coffins are lavish and colourful celebrations of life in
rebellion against their Sylvanian neighbours, and through constant
exposure to Chaos and Undeath the Ostermarks have developed a grim sense
of humour as bleak as the marshlands that dominate its landmass. While
all of the Empire gods recieve a degree of worship it is Morr that holds
most favour in Ostermark, and its people seem to revel competitively in
who can express the most theatrically over-the-top grimness. It is said
among the Empire that one should never ask an Ostermarker how their day
has been, for it is a guarantee of a depressing monologue.

As well as this Ostermark is also known for raising the boldest
warhorses in the Empire, and it is their steeds of the Veldt that are
often sold to the illustrious Reikland Knights. These origins can be
traced back to the Ungol raiders with their nomanic horse archery
generations ago, and while their knowledge of husbandry has been
retained their tactics have modernized: The people of Ostermark know
that the dead are not deterred by arrowfire, and due to their
less-than-friendly neighbours they have learned to adopt various
strategies and weapons to combat the Undead. As a result their Vampire
Hunters are revered, and Witch Hunters that seek to add Necromancers to
their lists will often travel to Ostermark to learn more. It was
Ostermark that pioneered the use of silver bullets and garlic to defend
themselves against Sylvania. Combining these traits it was inevitable
that a Knightly Order specialising in the combating of the Undead would
emerge. The Knights of Everlasting Light were the result; resplendent
knights in gleaming white, blue, and gold. Those who do not understand
Ostermark culture view it as brash borderline- Brettonian egomania, but
in actuality these colours in Ostermark have most in common with coffins, 
the novelty of riding to battle in a steel coffin being one the
Ostermark knights could not resist. These knights were for a time the
best in the Empire, above even the Blazing Sun, but after a disastrous
campaign in Araby their order was cursed to live in glory but die in
ignominy. Nobody took this seriously until Knights began drowning in
ankle-deep water, choking on fishbones while eating veal, and falling
down stairs. Now the Knights of Everlasting Light live in constant fear
of deaths that their peers could not celebrate, and as a result have
become suicidally determined to charge into overwhelming odds in hope of
overcoming their curse. Some of these Knights assemble warbands with
their savings and lead the charge into the Cursed City in the hope that
they, as so many others have, find fame and glory.

Special Rules: Nothing New: Ostermark warbands are so familiar with
Undeath that they are never effected by Fear effects caused by Undead
warbands. Dour: Nothing perks up an Ostermarker like having a good
reason to be miserable. If a Warband member is permanently killed the
entire warband gains +1 Leadership for the next battle. Alignment: the
Warband's Alignment must be Lawful/Neutral.

1 Knight of Everlasting Light 
180 gold crowns to hire
Profile WS BS S T W I A Ld 
4 4 3 4 4 1 4 2 8 
Weapons/Armour: A Knight of Everlasting Light
may be equipped with weapons and armour chosen from the Marshlander Equipment List
Skills: The Knight of Everlasting Light may choose from
Combat, Strength, Academic, and Speed when they gain a new skill.
Special Rules Leader: Any warrior within 6" of a Knight of Everlasting
Light may use their Leadership when taking Leadership tests. 
Curse of Ignominy: Knights of Everlasting Light will fail dangerous terrain tests
on a result of 1 or 2, rather than just 1. Additionally henchmen
infantry gain +1 to all injury rolls against the Knight of Everlasting
Light.
Veteran of Araby: These Knights are seasoned veterans of several
campaigns and many battles, to them the prospect of fighting out of the
saddle is inconcievable. As a result they will always own and ride a
free Barded Warhorse, even if they are robbed - they have a backup! They
also may never give away their horse.

when they gain a new skill.
Special Rules High Stakes: Vampire Hunters are all too aware of the inhuman speed
and strength of Vampires, and know that going toe-to-toe with one is dangerous work. As a result they
always carry a lucky stake "just in case". The stake counts as a dagger,
and if it hits a target then after resolving your 'to wound' roll it may
not be used for the rest of the battle, as it either breaks or gets
lodged somewhere irretrievable. Against Vampires the stake has the
Killing Blow special rule.
