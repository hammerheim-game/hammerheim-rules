#### Sisters of Sigmar

For centuries the nobility of the Empire has sent its wayward
or troublesome daughters to the Holy Convent of the Order of
Merciful Sisters of Sigmar in Mordheim to be initiated into
the only order of priestesses dedicated to the Empire’s patron
god. The Sisters of Sigmar, as they are commonly called,
have traditionally travelled the Empire administering to the
sick and poor, tending to the needs of orphans, curing the
diseased and mending broken bodies. As well as the healing
arts, which they practise with expert knowledge of herb-lore
and prayer, their advice is frequently sought by those about to
make an important decision, for the Sisters of Sigmar are
famed for their ability to predict the fickle course of fate.
Though once much loved by the common people, the Sisters
have seen their popularity wane in recent years. Rabble-
rousing Witch Hunters have denounced them as witches and
heretics, so that even in the countryside they are attacked and
driven away by the very peasants they seek to help. Many of
Sigmar’s priests wish to disband the order altogether,
claiming that women have no right to teach the holy word of
Sigmar. Even the Grand Theogonist, ostensibly the chief
authority over the order, has cooled towards the sisterhood,
denying the throne to Magritta of Marienburg who was
brought up by the Sisters and said to be sympathetic to their
cause. These days the Sisters of Sigmar have retreated to their
convent situated high on the craggy island of Sigmar’s Rock
in the river Stir in Mordheim.
Of all the inhabitants of Mordheim only the Sisters of Sigmar
were prepared for its destruction. Seeress Cassandora foretold
of the disaster and at their nightly vigil the Maidens of
Sigmar heard the voice of Sigmar speaking in their dreaming
minds. Thus they knew that they would be safe in their
fortress high above the city, raised as it is above the polluted
vapours, if only they were prepared to survive the fire of
Sigmar’s Fury.
While the rest of Mordheim fell under a spell of madness the
Sisters of Sigmar offered prayer after prayer, scourging
themselves to drive out all thoughts of sin, fervently
accepting a punishing penitential regime to harden their
minds against the wantonness running rampant outside their
walls. When the blow finally came the Sisters gathered
beneath the great temple dome of their convent which, well

built and fortified as it was by the prayers of the Sisters,
protected them from the fire and heat of their master’s ire.
The Sisters believe they have a holy mission, a task that they
have been set by Sigmar himself and to which they must
submit themselves body and soul. Their sacred duty is to
gather up the shards of wyrdstone and hide it deep beneath
Sigmar’s Rock in the vaults of their convent where, shielded
by a great depth of solid granite and guarded by the eternal
prayers of the sisterhood, it will cause no harm to Sigmar’s
people. It is a nigh hopeless task, for there are few Sisters and
countless shards of stone. Worse still, there are many who
want the stone for themselves, to take it from Mordheim and
spread its contagion amongst the cities of the Empire.
The warbands of the sisterhood are led by tough Matriarchs,
each accompanied by a body of warrior sisters. The training
and harsh discipline of the convent includes mastery of
martial as well as ecclesiastic skills, for mastery of the body
is but the first step towards the mastery of the soul. Their
favoured weapon is the warhammer, the instrument of
Sigmar, seen as his holy symbol, alongside the twin-tailed
comet.

Unlike the rest of the priestesses, they shave their heads, save for a
single long braid.

several years as Novices during which time their devotion will be
tested to the full. All are eager to prove themselves worthy to be the
handmaidens of Sigmar.
