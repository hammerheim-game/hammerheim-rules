# Core Rules

## Tabletop conflict

In Mordheim, the opposing factions – warbands – are represented by models, assembled and painted by you, each representing a single warrior. Your tabletop becomes part of the City of the Damned: the scene of the action, with ruined buildings, overhangs and walkways where the battles take place. 

The aim of the game is to outfight your opponent, which requires a mixture of skill and luck. You’ll soon learn how to arm and equip your warband effectively, and how to exploit the ruins and other terrain to your best advantage. 

You’ll probably want to expand your basic warband as you and they gain experience. This is easy as there are lots of models available for the warbands and new miniatures will be coming out all the time. With these you can expand your warband, equip your warriors with different weapons and armor, and hire mercenaries to join them.

## Building a warband

At first you will probably want to play individual games (see the Warbands section for more details) rather than a campaign. This will allow you to learn the rules, and also give you the opportunity to decide which type of warband is most suited to your particular style of play. 

If you are playing in a campaign, you will have the chance to expand and improve your warband after each game. By winning battles your warband will gain riches and wyrdstone, discover magical artefacts and may also have the opportunity to recruit mercenaries. 

In a campaign, every time your warband fights, its warriors gain in skill and experience. Raw recruits quickly progress to become fully fledged warriors, and your Heroes will learn new skills which will make them even better in combat. Each warband has its own objective and motivation for fighting in Mordheim: be it riches or political influence. Through countless battles and street skirmishes you can try to achieve your ambition and emerge victorious from the city!

#### New players

If you’re new to Games Workshop games you’ll be reassured to know that finding other players is not normally a problem - you’ll be surprised how many there are!

There may be a Games Workshop store near to you where you can buy models, paint and games supplements. However Games Workshop stores are not just shops, they are hobby centres, where the staff will happily help you to learn the rules, show you how to paint, and suggest ways to develop your warband. 

#### Warhammer players

If you already play Warhammer, the basic rules of Mordheim will be familiar to you. Remember though, Warhammer is designed for fighting battles between entire armies, whilst Mordheim represents individual action between a dozen or so warriors. 

As a result, some of the rules developed for mass combat in Warhammer do not apply to Mordheim, such as unit Break tests and rank bonuses. On the other hand, there are new rules for wounded warriors, climbing, parrying and other aspects of individual combat.

#### What you will need

As well as this book, you will need the following items to play Mordheim.

##### Citadel models

You will need enough miniatures of the appropriate race/type
to represent the warriors in your warband. It is a good idea to
work out your warband on paper first and then purchase the
miniatures that you require. Almost all possible weapon
variations can be added using the Mordheim equipment
spurs.
As you will see in the Warbands section, each warband fights
in a particular way – some are expert bowmen while others
are better in hand-to-hand combat. When choosing which
warband you want to lead you could choose one that reflects
your preferred playing style, or you could read the
background section and choose one that really captures your
imagination. A good way of picking a warband is simply to
pick the one with the models you like the best.

##### Playing surface

You will also need something to play your battles on. Any
firm, level surface is best, such as a tabletop or an area of
floor – most kitchen tables will do. It’s a good idea to use an
old sheet or blanket to protect the table from scratches. Some
players make a special gaming board from chipboard or other
similar material (divided into two or more pieces for ease of
storage) which they can use on top of a table to extend the
playing area. Whatever you use, you will find that a square
area approximately 4 x 4' is about right for most battles.

##### Terrain

The bitter struggles of a Mordheim battle take place in labyrinthine streets, ruined buildings and on derelict walkways. Pre-cut card and plastic scenery is available from Games Workshop, but many gamers enjoy making their own. 

As a rule, a table packed with scenery will lead to closer and more exciting games.

Throughout the book you will find photographs, drawings and descriptions of Mordheim. These should give you plenty of ideas for producing your own scenery. Games Workshop’s book _‘How to Make Wargames Terrain’_ is also a good source of ideas and practical hints. 

##### Counters

Counters can help you keep track of things on the tabletop.
You can always keep notes about who is hidden, carrying
treasure, etc, but counters are a convenient memory jogger
and speed the game up.
 
##### Hidden Counter Wyrdstone Counter
Above are some examples of counters you could photocopy and stick onto thin card if you wish.

##### Dice

All dice rolls use a standard six-sided dice (usually shortened to D6). Sometimes you will be asked to modify the result of the dice roll. This is noted as D6 plus or minus a number, such as D6+1 or D6-2. Roll the dice and add or subtract the number indicated to get the final result. You may have to roll a number of dice in one go. For example, 2D6 means roll two dice and add the scores together. You may also come across the term D3. As there is no such thing as a three-sided dice, use the following method for determining a score between 1 and 3. Roll a D6 and halve the score, rounding up: 1 or 2 equals 1, 3 or 4 equals 2 and 5 or 6 equals 3. If you are given the opportunity to re-roll a dice roll, you must accept the second score, even if it’s worse than the original. Artillery Dice: The Artillery Dice is one of the more Specialise dice used in Games Workshop Games; the dice is a standard six-sided dice but numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10, and the final side is marked with misfire. A standard six-sided dice can be used in places of an Artillery Dice, just double the face value of the dice, and a Six would count as the Misfire. Scatter Dice: this is another more Specialise dice used in Games Workshop Games; this is a standard six-sided dice that has no numbers but has Arrows and a hit marker. A standard six-sided dice can be used in places of a Scatter Dice, clockwise, the top of the Dice = 1, right side = 2, Bottom = 3, left side = 4 and a 5 or 6 means that the shot was on target and did not move. 

##### Tape measure

For measuring ranges you will need a tape measure marked in inches, or a couple of plastic range rulers.

##### Other equipment

You will also need pens and paper to record details of your warriors’ weapons and other details. You can use roster sheets for this, and blank ones are included at the back of this book. We recommend you photocopy them rather than use the originals. 

### Characteristics

In Mordheim the warriors each have different abilities, some
being better at certain actions, for example, fighting, shooting
or climbing, than they are at others. This variety in each
warrior is represented in the form of characteristics and
skills. Right now don’t worry about skills – these come later
with practice and battle experience. For now we just need to
consider a warrior’s characteristics.
Each model is defined by a set of characteristics: Movement,
Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds,
Initiative, Attacks and Leadership. Each characteristic is
assigned a value of (usually) between 1 and 10. The higher
the value your model has for any characteristic the better –
for example, a model with a Strength of 6 is stronger than a
model that has a Strength of 2.
MOVEMENT (M): A model’s Movement rate shows how
far the model can move in a turn, under normal conditions.
For example, a typical Human has a move of 4", while a
fleet-footed nimble Skaven has a move of 5".
WEAPON SKILL (WS): Weapon Skill is a measure of
close combat ability (i.e., how good the warrior is at hand-to-
hand fighting). A deadly swordsman or a crazed berserker
would have a high value compared to a lowly acolyte, for
example. The higher the WS, the more likely your warrior is
to hit his opponent.
BALLISTIC SKILL (BS): This shows how good a shot the
individual is. When you shoot a bow or fire a pistol, the
chance of hitting a target depends upon your model’s
Ballistic Skill. A normal Human has a BS of 3, though an
experienced marksman might have a BS of 4, 5 or even
higher.
STRENGTH (S): Strength indicates how strong a warrior is!
It is especially important for hand-to-hand combat, because
the stronger you are the harder you can hit. A Strength value
of 3 is about average.
TOUGHNESS (T): This is a measure of how easily an
individual can withstand a hit from a weapon or a blow from
a club or fist. The tougher you are, the harder you are to
wound or kill. An average Toughness value is 3, though a
gnarled old warrior might have a Toughness of 4!
WOUNDS (W): A model’s Wounds value shows how many
times the model can be wounded before it collapses, is killed
or incapacitated. Most individuals have only 1 Wound but
veteran warriors or large creatures such as Ogres might have
more.
INITIATIVE (I): The Initiative value indicates how fast and
nimble the warrior is. It determines the attacking order in
hand-to-hand combat, and is particularly important when the
model is climbing and moving amidst the ruins of Mordheim.
ATTACKS (A): The Attacks value indicates how many
blows the model can make in hand-to-hand combat. Most
warriors have an Attacks value of 1, but powerful fighters
may have more. The more Attacks you have, the greater the

chance you’ve got of beating your opponents into an
unrecognisable pulp!
LEADERSHIP (Ld): Leadership represents raw courage,
self control and charisma. The higher the model’s Leadership
value, the more likely he is to remain steadfast in combat
while others run off or are slain. For example, a cowardly
Skaven may have a Leadership of 5, while a cool, calm Elf
could have a Leadership of 8 or higher.
#### Zero level characteristics

Some creatures in Mordheim have been given a ‘0’ for
certain characteristics which means that they have no ability
in that field whatsoever. This usually applies to creatures
unable to use missile weapons (who would have a BS of 0)
but it might equally apply to other characteristics as well.
If a model has a WS of 0 then it cannot defend itself in hand-
to-hand combat, and any blows struck against it will
automatically hit.
#### Characteristic profiles

A model’s characteristic values are written in the form of a
chart called a characteristics profile (or just profile).
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Dieter Stahl 4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
The example above is a typical profile for a Human warrior.
As you fight in more games against other players, your
warriors will get better and their characteristics may increase.
All these details are recorded using the Warband roster sheets
provided at the back of this book. This is explained properly
later on. For now it is enough to know what each
characteristic is for and how their values vary.
#### Characteristic tests

Often in the game a model will be required to take a test on
one of his own characteristics. In order to pass this test, the
model has to roll a D6 and obtain a result equal to or lower
than the value of the characteristic involved. Note that if you
roll a 6, you automatically fail the test regardless of the
model’s characteristic value.
For example: Dieter Stahl is jumping down from a wall that
is 3" high and has to take an Initiative test. He has an
Initiative value of 3 on his characteristic profile and therefore
will be successful if he rolls a 1, 2 or 3 on a D6. If he rolls a
4, 5 or 6 he will fail the test and fall down, suffering all the
painful consequences!
#### Leadership tests

Tests against the Leadership characteristic are done in a
slightly different way. In the case of a Leadership test, you
should roll two dice and add the two scores together. If the
result is equal to or less than the model’s Leadership
characteristic, the test has been passed.
For example: Dieter’s Leadership is 7, so to pass a
Leadership test he must roll 7 or less on 2D6.


### The Turn

In Mordheim you are in a charge of a warband and your
opponent is in charge of another.
The warriors and scenery in the game are set up on the
tabletop in a way that is appropriate for the encounter you are
fighting. Do not worry about this for now as these things will
be explained in full in the Scenarios section.
To play, one side takes a turn, then the other side, then the
original side and so on, much like in a game of draughts or
chess. When it is your turn, you may move all your models,
shoot with any warriors able to do so, and fight in hand-to-
hand combat. Once your turn is complete, it is your
opponent’s turn to move, shoot and fight.

#### Phases

To keep track of who is doing what and when, each turn is
split into four phases. This is called the Turn sequence.

Turn sequence
1 Recovery: During the recovery phase you may attempt to
rally individuals who have lost their nerve and recover
models that are knocked down or stunned.
2 Movement: During the movement phase you may move the
warriors of your warband according to the rules given in the
Movement section.

3 Shooting: In the shooting phase you may shoot with any
appropriate weapons as described in the rules for shooting.
4 Hand-to-hand combat: During the hand-to-hand combat
phase all models in hand-to-hand combat may fight. Note that
both sides fight in the hand-to-hand combat phase, regardless
of whose turn it is.
#### Recovery phase

During the recovery phase you may attempt to rally any of
your models who have lost their nerve (see the Recovery
Phase rules). To take a Rally test, roll 2D6. If the score is
equal to or less than the model’s Leadership value the model
stops fleeing and has rallied; turn it to face in any direction
you wish. The model cannot move or shoot for the rest of the
turn, but models able to do so can cast spells. If the test is
failed, the model will continue to flee towards the closest
table edge.
Note that a model cannot rally if the closest model to him is
an enemy model (fleeing, stunned, knocked down and hidden
models are not taken into consideration for this).
During the recovery phase, warriors in your warband who
have been stunned become knocked down instead and
warriors who have been knocked down may stand up (see the
Injuries section).


### Movement

During the movement phase models are moved in the
following order:

1. Charge!: If you want a model in your warband to charge
at an enemy model and attack it in hand-to-hand combat then
you must do this at the start of the movement phase before
moving any of your other models. When you charge a model,
declare to your opponent that you are doing so and indicate
which of his models it is attacking.
2. Compulsory Moves: Sometimes a model is forced to
move in a certain way and this is called a compulsory move.
For example, a fighter whose nerve breaks must run away
from his enemies and take cover.
Make all of your models’ compulsory moves before finishing
any remaining movement.
3. Remaining Moves: Once you have moved your chargers
and made any compulsory moves, you may move the rest of
your warriors as you see fit.

#### Moving

During their movement phase, models can move up to
movement rate their in any direction. They may move
(including running and charging) up and down ladders and
stairs, and over low obstacles such as barrels, boxes, etc.
In normal circumstances models don’t have to move their full
distance, or at all if you do not want them to. All exceptions
are explained later and invariably involve either charging or
compulsory moves.

#### Running

The normal Movement value of models represents a warrior
moving at a fairly rapid rate, but allows time for him to aim
and shoot a weapon and generally observe what is going on
around him. If you wish, a model may move much quicker
than this – he can run! A running warrior can move at double
speed (for example, 8" rather than 4"). Note that running is
not the same as charging as it does not allow your model to
engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat.
A model can only run if there are no enemy models within 8"
of it at the start of the turn (fleeing, stunned, knocked down
and hidden models do not count). Check this distance after
any charges have been declared. If there are any enemies
within 8" at the start of the turn, the model will prepare to
fight instead and so is unable to run. The running model can
move closer than 8" to an enemy as it moves.
Any model that runs loses its chance to shoot during that
turn. He is concentrating on running and is not prepared to
fight, having sheathed or shouldered his weapons. You
should declare that models are running as they move, as this
will remind both players that the model is unable to shoot
that turn. Running models can cast spells as normal.

#### Charge!

If you want a model to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand
combat then you must make a special move called a charge.
Without measuring the distance, declare that your model is
charging and indicate which enemy model he is going to
attack. You can charge any opposing model if you can draw
an unobstructed line from your model to the target. If your
warrior wants to charge an enemy model within 4" that he

can’t see (e.g., because it is behind a corner) but has not been
declared as hidden, he must pass an Initiative test to detect it.
If he fails the roll, your model may not charge this turn, but
may move his normal distance, shoot and cast spells.
A charge is like a running move, performed at double the
Movement rate, but ends with the attacker moving by the
most direct route into base-to-base contact with the enemy
model. Once their bases are touching they are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat. Models are also considered to be in
hand-to-hand combat even when separated by a low wall or
obstacle, where it is impossible for the bases to touch
physically because the obstacle is in the way.
 
If an unengaged (i.e., not in hand-to-hand combat) enemy
model lies within 2" of the charge route, that model may
choose to intercept the charger if he wishes. This
‘interception area’ is shown in the diagram above. Only one
enemy model may attempt to intercept each charger. If the
intercepting warrior would normally require a Fear test to
engage the charger then he must pass one in order to be
allowed to intercept. Failure means he will not move. If the
intercepting warrior causes fear then move the models into
contact and then take a Fear test for the original charger
(assuming he would normally do so) as if he was the one
being charged. Regardless of the results of this test it is still
the original charger who counts as charging in the subsequent
round of combat, not the intercepting warrior.
Sometimes a charging warrior may not reach the enemy
because you have miscalculated the distance. If this happens
move your warrior his normal move distance towards the
enemy. This is called a failed charge. The model cannot shoot
in the same turn in which he failed a charge, but he can cast
spells as normal.
Models cannot be moved into hand-to-hand combat except by
charging – any move that brings a warrior into hand-to-hand


combat is a charge by definition. A model that charges will
‘strike first’ in the first round of the ensuing combat.

#### Charging more than one opponent

If you can move your warrior into base contact with more
than one enemy model with its charge move, it can charge
them both. This might be inadvisable as it’ll then be fighting
two enemies at once!

#### Hiding

The Hiding rule represents warriors concealing themselves in
a way that our unmoving and dramatically posed models
cannot. A hiding warrior keeps as still as possible, just
peeking out of cover.
A model can hide if he ends his move behind a low wall, a
column or in a similar position where he could reasonably
conceal himself. The player must declare that the warrior is
hiding and place a Hidden counter beside the model for it to
count as being hidden.
A model that runs, flees, is stunned or charges cannot hide
that turn. His sudden burst of speed does not give him time to
hide.
A model may stay hidden over several turns, so long as he
stays behind a wall or similar feature. He may even move
around so long as he stays hidden while doing so. If an
enemy moves so that he can see the hidden warrior, the
model is no longer hidden and the counter is removed. When
hidden, a warrior cannot be seen, shot at or charged.
While hiding, a model cannot shoot or cast spells without
giving away its position. If a hidden model shoots, or moves
so that he can be seen, he is no longer hidden and can be shot
at as normal.
A model may not hide if he is too close to an enemy model –
he will be seen or heard no matter how well concealed.
Enemy warriors will always see, hear or otherwise detect
hidden foes within their Initiative value in inches. So a
warrior whose Initiative value is 3 will automatically spot all
hidden enemies within 3".

#### Terrain

The ruined city of Mordheim is a dark and dangerous place,
where tumbled down towers and blasted houses form a vast
maze of streets and alleyways.
OPEN GROUND: The tabletop surface, floors of buildings,
connecting overhangs, ladders and ropes are all considered to
be open ground and will not affect movement even if the
model is charging. It can also go through doors and hatches
without slowing down.
DIFFICULT GROUND: Difficult ground includes steep or
treacherous slopes, bushes and the angled roofs of buildings.
Models move at half speed over difficult terrain.
VERY DIFFICULT GROUND: This is really dangerous
terrain, such as narrow crawl holes through the rubble.
Models may move at a quarter rate, so if the model moves 4"
over open ground it can only move 1" over very difficult
ground.
WALLS AND BARRIERS: Walls, hedges and other low
obstacles form barriers that you can either go around or leap
over. A model can leap over a barrier that is less than 1" high.
This does not affect its movement in any way.

#### Climbing

Often the ruined buildings of Mordheim do not have stairs or
ladders, so your warriors will have to climb to reach the
upper floors of buildings.
Any model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences,
walls, etc. He must be touching what he wants to climb at the
start of his movement phase. He may climb up to his total
Movement in a single movement phase (but cannot run while
he is climbing). Any remaining movement can be used as
normal. If the height is more than the model’s normal move,
he cannot climb the wall.
To climb, a model must take an Initiative test. If he fails it
whilst climbing up, he cannot move that turn. If he fails it
while climbing down, he falls from where he started his
descent (see the Falling section).
#### Jumping down

Your warrior may jump down from high places (up to a
maximum height of 6") such as walkways and balconies at
any time during his movement phase. Take an Initiative test
for every full 2" he jumps down. If he fails any of the tests,
the model falls from the point where he jumped, takes
damage (see Falling) and may not move any more during the
movement phase. If successful, the model can continue his
movement as normal (jumping down does not use up any of
the model’s Movement allowance).
#### Diving charge

You may charge any enemy troops that are below a balcony
or overhang, etc, that your model is on. If an enemy model is
within 2" of the place where your warrior lands, he may make
a diving charge against it. Take an Initiative test for each full
2" of height your model jumped down from, up to a
maximum of 6", like a normal jump. If he fails any of them,
your model has fallen and suffers damage, may not move any
more during the movement phase and cannot charge the
enemy. If he succeeds, the model gains a +1 Strength bonus
and +1 to hit bonus but only during the following hand-to-
hand combat phase.
#### Jumping over gaps

Models may jump over gaps (up to a maximum of 3") and
streets, (e.g., from the roof of a building to another). Deduct
the distance jumped from the model’s movement but
remember that you cannot measure the distance before
jumping. If your model does not have enough movement to
jump the distance, he automatically falls. If your model is
able to cover the distance, he must pass an Initiative test or
fall. A model may jump over a gap and still fire a missile
weapon if it is not running. It may also jump as part of its
charge or running move.



#### Warriors knocked down or stunned

If a warrior is knocked down or stunned (see the Shooting
section for details) within 1" of the edge of a roof or building,
there is a chance that it will slip and fall off. Take an
Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model falls over the
edge to the ground and takes damage as detailed below.

#### Falling

A model that falls takes D3 hits at a Strength equal to the
height in inches that it fell (e.g., if the model fell 4", it would
take D3 hits at Strength 4). No armor saves apply. Falling
will not cause critical hits (see the Hand-to-Hand Combat
section for the Critical Hits rules). A model that falls may not
move any further or hide during that turn, even if it is not
hurt.

#### Swimming

Players should establish which way the river is flowing at the
start of the game. To represent how models interact with
water these basic rules apply:
1. All rivers count as difficult (or worse) terrain for all
	models except those considered as aquatic.
2. Models swimming with the current will double their
	base move.
3. Models swimming against the current of a slow
	moving river may only move a quarter of their base
	move, but you may not swim against the current of a
	fast moving river.
4. Aquatic models suffer no reduction of their base move
	when swimming against the current of a slow moving
	river but may not swim against the current of a fast
	moving river.
5. Models wearing armor may not attempt to move
	through any water deeper than shallow. Shields and
	bucklers do not count for this as they are assumed to
	be strapped on the backs.
Aquatic models in water, either swamp, streams or rivers can
elect to be Hidden at the discretion of the player. Models
cannot move upstream in fast moving rivers without floating
transportation, such as a boat or canoe.


### Shooting

Warriors that fight in the ruins of Mordheim are usually
armed to the teeth! Individual warriors often have several
different weapons such as swords, knives, bows and even
blackpowder weapons.
During your warband’s shooting phase each of your warriors
may shoot once with one of his weapons. This means that he
can fire a bow, shoot with a crossbow, or hurl a throwing
knife, for example.
Work through the models one at a time. Pick which fighter is
going to shoot, nominate his target, work out whether he hits
the enemy and, if he does, any wounds or injuries that are
caused. Then continue with the next shooter. You can take
shots in any order you wish. Be sure to remember or note
down which models have already shot.

#### Who can shoot

Each model can shoot once in the shooting phase, so long as
he can see a target and assuming he has a suitable weapon.
He may not fire in the following circumstances: if he is
engaged in hand-to-hand combat, has run or failed a charge in
the movement phase, has rallied this turn or is stunned or
knocked down.
To shoot at a target, a model must be able to see it, and the
only way to check this is to stoop over the tabletop for a
model’s eye view. Models can see all around themselves (i.e.,
360°), and they may be turned freely to face in any direction
before firing. Note that turning on the spot does not count as
moving.

#### Closest target

You must shoot at the closest enemy, as he represents the
most immediate threat and therefore the most obvious target.
However, you may shoot at a more distant target if it is easier
to hit or if closer models are stunned or knocked down (see
diagram on next page). For example, a closer target may be
hard to hit because it is in cover, whilst a more distant target
might be in the open and therefore an easier shot. You may
always choose to shoot at a Large Target if you can see it,
whether it is in cover or not and even if it is not the closest
target.
You can shoot at models that are fleeing, knocked down or
stunned, but you can choose to ignore them, because they do
not represent an immediate threat. It is better to shoot the
closest standing enemy model instead.
Note that you may not shoot at models that are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat, as the risk of hitting your comrades is
too great.

#### Cover

The many walls, ruined buildings and other masonry in
Mordheim offer plenty of cover. If any portion of the target is
hidden by a piece of scenery or another model, the shooting
model will suffer a penalty as explained below.

Sometimes it will be obvious whether a target can be seen; at
other times it will be more difficult, as buildings and other
scenery are in the way. If the shooter can see only part of the
target’s body, the target is in cover and the shooter suffers a -
1 penalty on his To Hit roll.
If a shot misses its target by 1, and that target claimed the -
modifier for cover, then the shot strikes the cover instead.
Normally this doesn’t matter, but in the case where a model
is concealed behind another warrior, or when the cover is a
powder keg, it might be extremely important!


#### Shooting from an elevated position

A model situated in an elevated position (i.e., anything that is
more than 2" above the table surface, such as an upper floor
of a building), may freely pick any target he can see and
shoot at it. The exception to this rule is that if there are
enemies in the same building and in line of sight of the
shooter, he must shoot at these, as they present a more
immediate threat.
#### Range

Once you have decided to shoot and have chosen a target you
must measure to see whether the shot is within range. Each
type of missile weapon has a maximum range, as described in
the Weapons & Armor section of the book.
Assuming that your target is within range your warrior can
proceed with the shot. If the target is out of range then he has
automatically missed this turn.
#### Hitting the target

To determine whether a shot hits its target, roll a D6. The
dice score needed will depend upon how good a shot the
shooter is (as indicated by his Ballistic Skill). The chart
below shows the minimum D6 roll needed to score a hit.
BS of shooter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
D6 roll needed 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -
#### Hit modifiers

It is easier to hit a target that is in the open compared to a
target behind cover. Usually it is also easier to hit a target if it
is close compared to one further away. These situations are
represented by the following modifiers:
HIT MODIFIERS
-1 Cover: If any part of the model is obscured by scenery or
other models then it counts as being in cover.
-1 Long range: If you are shooting at a target that is more
than half of your weapon’s maximum range away.
-1 Moving: If your model has moved at all shooting (other
than standing up, or turning to face your target) during this
turn.

+1 Large Target: If either the target model has the Large
Target special rule (such as an Ogre), or whose main ‘body’
is over 2" tall or wide (such as most buildings).
#### Roll to Wound

Once you have hit a target test to see if a wound is inflicted.
A shot may fail to cause a wound because it hits part of the
target’s equipment, just scratches the skin or causes some
very minor injury which the warrior bravely (or stupidly)
ignores. If you fail to cause a wound, the target is unharmed.
To determine whether your shot has caused a wound,
compare the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of
the target. You will find a complete description of the various


weapons together with their Strength values and special rules
in the Weapons & Armor section.
The chart above shows the D6 score required to turn a hit into
a wound Note that a dash (–) means that there is no chance of
wounding the target.
Deploying your archers in the upper floors of buildings is a
good idea. They will be in cover and can freely pick their
targets.

#### Critical Hits

If you roll a 6 when rolling to wound (for hand-to-hand combat and shooting only) you will cause a critical hit. Roll a D6 and consult the Critical Hit chart below to determine the damage caused by the critical hit. You should also roll to see whether the target makes its armor save or suffers damage as normal. 

In addition, if the attacker normally needs 6s to wound his target, he cannot cause a critical hit. His opponent is simply too tough to suffer a serious injury at the hands of such a puny creature! 

Each warrior may only cause one critical hit in each hand-to- hand combat phase (see the Close Combat section), so if he has several attacks, the first 6 you roll to wound will cause a critical hit. 

Depending on what weapon your warrior is using, you may roll on one of the following Critical Hit charts. For example, if your warrior is using a sword, roll on the Bladed Weapons chart. All the rules governing critical hits given in the main rules also apply to these tables.

##### Missile weapons

_(Bows, crossbows, blackpowder weapons, throwing knives etc.)_

| | | |
| :-: | | |
| 1-2 | Hits a Weak Spot | The missile penetrates its target’s armor. Ignore all armor saves. |
| 3-4 | Ricochet | If there are any other models within 6", the closest enemy model is also hit. Roll to wound and take any saves as normal for both targets. |
| 5-6 | Master Shot | The missile hits an eye, the throat, or some other vulnerable part. The target suffers 2 wounds instead of 1. There is no armor save. |

##### Bludgeoning weapons

_(Clubs, maces, hammers, flails, double-handed hammers etc.)_

| | | |
| :-: | | |
| 1-2 | Hammered | The target is knocked off balance. Your opponent may not fight this turn if he hasn’t already fought. |
| 3-4 | Clubbed | The hit ignores armor saves and saves from helmets.
| 5 | Wild Sweep | Your opponent’s weapon is knocked from his hand. If he is carrying two weapons, roll to see which one he loses. He must fight with whatever back-up weapon he has in his equipment for the rest of this combat (or fight unarmed if he has no other weapons). Roll to wound and take armor saves as normal. |
| 6 | Bludgeoned | The victim automatically goes out of action if he fails his armor save. Even if he has several wounds remaining, he will be taken out of action by this attack. |

##### Bladed weapons

_(Swords, axes, double-handed swords etc.)_

| | | |
| :-: | | |
| 1-2 | Flesh Wound | This attack hits an unprotected area, so there is no armor save. |
| 3-4 | Bladestorm | The warrior unleashes a virtual hail of blows. The attack causes 2 wounds instead of 1. Take armor saves separately for each wound. Remember that, as with other critical hits, if an attack causes multiple wounds for other reasons as well, you choose the highest number of wounds. |
| 5-6 | Sliced! | The strike ignores armor saves, causes 2 wounds, and your warrior gains +2 to any Injury rolls. |

##### Unarmed combat

_(War dogs, warhorses, Zombies, Possessed, animals etc.)_

| | | |
| :-: | | |
| 1-2 | Body Blow | Your opponent staggers, allowing you to seize the initiative and make an additional attack. Immediately roll to hit and to wound. Any saves are taken as normal. |
| 3-4 | Crushing Blow | The blow lands with tremendous force. You gain +1 to the Injury roll if your opponent fails his save. |
| 5-6 | Mighty Blow | With a mighty punch or flying kick, you send your opponent sprawling to the ground. The attack ignores armor saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. |

##### Thrusting weapons

_(Spears, halberds, lances etc.)_

| | | |
| :-: | | |
| 1-2 | Stab | With a quick strike, you penetrate your opponent’s defences. You gain +1 to any Injury rolls. Armor saves are taken as normal. |
| 3-4 | Thrust | The thrust lands with great force and the target is knocked down. Take armor saves as normal and see whether the model suffers a wound. |
| 5-6 | Kebab! | The thrust knocks the target back with titanic force, ripping apart armor and puncturing flesh. The attack ignores armor saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. The victim is knocked backwards D6" and the attacker follows, staying in base contact. Any other models involved in the combat are separated and only the model which struck the blow and his target are still considered to be in combat. If the target collides with another model, the other model is hit once at S3. |

#### Armor

Steel breastplates, chainmail, leather tunics, shields... all these and more are readily available in the forges of the villages surrounding Mordheim. That is if you are prepared to pay the price, since armor is very expensive. 

 f a warrior wearing armor suffers a wound roll a D6. If the dice roll is sufficiently high the wounding hit has bounced off the armor and has not hurt the wearer at all. The dice score required varies according to the type of armor. 

 he table below summarises the most common armor types and the D6 rolls required to make a save. Note that carrying a shield increases the save by +1. For example, a warrior in light armor with a shield will save on a roll of a 5 or 6. A warrior who has a shield but no armor will save on a roll of a 6. 
 
Minimum D6 score Armor required to save

| Light armor | 6 |
| Heavy armor | 5 |
| Gromril armor | 4 |

Shield adds +1 to the armor save

#### Armor save modifiers

Some weapons are better at penetrating armor than others. A
shot from a short bow can be deflected relatively easily, but a
shot from a crossbow penetrates armor much more
effectively.

The higher a weapon’s Strength, the more easily it can pierce
armor. The chart below shows the reduction to the enemy’s
armor saving throw for different Strength weapons.

| Strength | Save modifier |
| 1- 3 | None |
| 4 | - |
| 5 | - |
| 6 | - |
| 7 | - |
| 8 | - |
| 9+ | - |

Some weapons are better at penetrating armor than their Strength value suggests (Elven bows, for example). This is covered in the entry for each particular weapon (see the Weapons & Armor section). 

_Example: Dieter wears heavy armor and carries a shield. His armor save is 4+. He is hit by a crossbow (Strength 4) and therefore he will save on a D6 roll of 5+ (i.e., 4+ 1 = 5+). _

#### Injuries

Most warriors have a Wounds characteristic of 1, but some have a value of 2 or more. If the target has more than 1 wound then deduct 1 from his total each time he suffers a wound. Make a note on the roster sheet. So long as the model has at least 1 wound remaining he may continue to fight. As soon as a fighter’s Wounds are reduced to zero, roll to determine the extent of his injuries. The player who inflicted the wound rolls a D6 for the wound that reduced the model to zero wounds and for every wound the model receives after that. If a model suffers several wounds in one turn, roll once for each of them and apply the highest result. 

| 1-2 | Knocked down | The force of the blow knocks the warrior down. Place the model face up to show that he has been knocked down. |
| 3-4 | Stunned | The target falls to the ground where he lies wounded and barely conscious. Turn the model face down to show that he has been stunned. |
| 5-6 | Out of action | The target has been badly hurt and falls to the ground unconscious. He takes no further part in the game and is immediately removed from the battle. |

#### Knocked down

A fighter who has been knocked down falls to the ground
either because of a jarring blow he has sustained, because he
has slipped, or because he has thrown himself to the ground
to avoid injury. Turn the model face up to show that he has
been knocked down. Knocked down models may crawl 2"
during the movement phase, but may not fight in hand-to-
hand combat, shoot or cast spells. If he is in base-to-base
contact with an enemy, a knocked down model can crawl 2"
away only if the enemy is engaged in hand-to-hand combat
with another opponent, otherwise he has to stay where he is.
In combat he cannot strike back and the enemy will have a
good chance of putting him out of action (see the Warriors
Knocked Down section of the Close Combat rules on page
13).
A warrior who has been knocked down may stand up at the
start of his next turn. In that turn he may move at half rate,
shoot and cast spells, he cannot charge or run. If he is
engaged in hand-to-hand combat, he may not move away and



will automatically strike last, irrespective of weapons or
Initiative. After this turn the fighter moves and fights
normally, even though he has zero wounds left. If the model
takes any further wounds, then roll for injury once more,
exactly as if the model had just sustained its last wound.

#### Stunned

When a warrior is stunned, he is either badly injured or
temporarily knocked out. Turn the model face down to show
that he has been stunned. A fighter who is stunned may do
nothing at all. A player may turn the model face up in the

next recovery phase, and the warrior is then treated as
knocked down.
#### Out of action

A warrior who is out of action is also out of the game.
Remove the model from the tabletop. It’s impossible to tell at
this point whether the warrior is alive or dead, but for game
purposes it makes no difference at this stage. After the battle
you can test to see whether he survives and if he sustains any
serious lasting injuries as a result of his wounds (see page
170 for details).
### Close Combat

#### Who can fight

Models whose bases are touching are engaged in hand-to-
hand combat. This can only happen once a warrior has
charged his enemy, as models are otherwise not allowed to
move into contact.
All close quarter fighting is worked out in the hand-to-hand
combat phase. Regardless of whose turn it is, all models in
hand-to-hand combat will fight. A warrior can fight against
enemies to his side, front, or rear. In reality the fighters are
constantly moving, dodging, and weaving as they struggle to
kill their adversaries.
Models fighting in hand-to-hand combat do not shoot in the
shooting phase. They are far too busy fighting for their lives.
Any very close range shots they are able to make using
pistols are treated like close combat weapon attacks (see the
Weapons & Armor section).

#### Who strikes first

Normally, models fight in order of descending Initiative with
the highest striking first. If their Initiatives are equal, roll a
dice to see who strikes first. If a model stood up in the
Recovery phase of that turn, then he will strike last
irrespective of any other circumstances.
Sometimes a model will be allowed to ‘strike first’ for some
reason. Most commonly this is because they charged in that
turn, but some equipment, skills and spells produce the same
effect. If only one model ‘strikes first’ then it does so and the
remainder of the combatants strike in Initiative order as
described above.

If there are several models who are each entitled to ‘strike
first’, then they determine the order of combat between
themselves by Initiative, as described above. Once all those
that were eligible to ‘strike first’ have fought, any other
combatants fight in Initiative order.

##### Which models fight

A model can fight if its base is touching the base of an enemy
model. Even models attacked from the side or rear can fight.
If a warrior is touching more than one enemy, he can choose
which to attack. If he has more than 1 Attack, he can divide
them in any way the player wishes, so long as he makes this
clear before rolling to hit.

#### Hitting the enemy

To determine whether hits are scored, roll a D6 for each
model fighting. If a model has more than 1 Attack roll a D
for each attack.

The dice roll needed to score a hit on your enemy depends
upon the Weapon Skills of the attacker and the foe. Compare
the Weapon Skill of the attacker with that of his opponent
and consult the To Hit chart below to find the minimum D
score needed to hit.

##### Fighting with two weapons

Some maniac warriors carry two weapons, one in each hand,
so they can rain a flurry of blows on their enemies. A warrior
armed with two one-handed weapons may make 1 extra
Attack with the additional weapon. Note that this is added to
the total of the warrior’s attacks after other modifiers, such as
frenzy, have been applied. If he is armed with two different
weapons (sword and dagger, for example), he will make a
single attack with whichever weapon he chooses, and all
others with the remaining weapon. Roll to hit and wound for
each weapon separately.

#### Weapon modifiers

Unlike hits from shooting, the Strength of the attacker is used
to determine wounds, rather than that of the weapon itself.
However, some weapons confer a bonus on the attacker’s
Strength (see the Weapons & Armor section for full details).

#### Roll to wound

Once your model has hit a target you must test to see whether
a wound is inflicted. Sometimes a strike may fail to wound
simply because it causes an insignificant injury or glances off
the enemy’s equipment.

To determine whether the blow has caused a wound compare
the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of the target.
You will find a complete description of the various weapons
together with their Strength values and special rules in the
Weapons & Armor section.

Follow the same procedure for wounding and causing critical
hits as in the Shooting section. Note that a dash (–) means
that there is no chance of wounding the target.

#### Armor

Combatants that are wounded have the chance to avoid
damage if they are wearing armor or carrying shields. This
is exactly the same as described for shooting, and the same
rules apply.
For each wound suffered the player rolls a D6. If he rolls
greater than or equal to the armor save of his fighter then
that wound has been absorbed or deflected by the armor.

#### Armor save modifiers

Some models are so powerful that armor provides less
protection against them.

The higher a creature’s Strength the more easily it can pierce armor. The following chart shows the reduction in the enemy’s armor saving throw caused by the attacker’s Strength.

| Strength | Save modifier |
| 1-3 | None |
| 4 | - |
| 5 | - |
| 6 | - |
| 7 | - |
| 8 | - |
| 9+ | - |

Some weapons also confer a bonus to the user’s Strength,
making it more likely that any hits will pierce the opponent’s
armor. These bonuses are given in the Weapons & Armor
section.

#### Parry

Bucklers are small shields which offer no increase to the
armor saving throw, but allow you to parry attacks. Swords
are also used to parry enemy attacks.

When an opponent scores a hit, warriors equipped with
bucklers or swords may try to parry the blow.

Roll a D6. If the score is higher than the number your
opponent rolled to hit, the buckler or sword has parried the
strike. Note that it is therefore impossible to parry a blow
which scored a 6 on the roll to hit.

A buckler or sword may only parry one blow per hand-to-
hand combat phase. A parried blow is ignored and has no
effect. If your opponent scored several hits, you will have to
try to beat the highest score (if the highest score is a 6, you
automatically lose the chance of parrying that opponent’s
attacks). If a model is fighting against several opponents, it
may only parry the strike from the enemy who makes the first
hit(s) (i.e., the attacking model with the highest Initiative). In
the case of equal Initiative characteristics roll a dice to decide
who strikes first.

If your model is armed with a buckler and a sword, you may
re-roll any failed parries once. A model armed with two
swords can still only roll once, but may add +1 to the results.
A model may not parry attacks made with twice (or more) his
own basic Strength – they are simply too powerful to be
stopped.

#### Warriors knocked down

If an enemy is fighting a warrior who is knocked down, he
may attack him to put him out of his misery. All attacks
against a warrior who is knocked down hit automatically. If
any of the attacks wound the knocked down model and he
fails his armor save, he is automatically taken out of action
as explained previously. A knocked down model may not
parry.

#### Warriors stunned

A stunned warrior is at the mercy of his enemies. A stunned
model is automatically taken out of action if an enemy can
attack him in hand-to-hand combat.
#### Attacking stunned and knocked down

#### warriors

Note that a model with multiple attacks may not stun / knock
down and then automatically take a warrior out of action
during the same hand-to-hand combat phase. The only way
you can achieve this is to have more than one of your models
attacking the same enemy. So, if the enemy is stunned /
knocked down by the first warrior, he can be hit and put out of
action by the next warrior to attack.

If your model is engaged in close combat with an enemy who
is still standing, he cannot attack any other models that are
stunned or knocked down, since in reality they will not pose
an immediate threat to him and their companions will try to
protect them.

#### Moving from combat

Once models are engaged in hand-to-hand combat they cannot move away during their movement phase. They must fight until they are either taken out of action, until they take out their enemies, or until one or the other breaks and runs. The exception to this rule is that if all a model’s close combat opponents are knocked down or stunned, he may move away from the combat if you wish, and even charge other enemies within range. 

#### Breaking from combat

A warrior who panics whilst fighting in hand-to-hand combat
will break off and make a run for it as described in the
Leadership & Psychology section.
When a fighter breaks from combat he simply turns and runs
off. His opponents automatically hit the warrior as he breaks,
each inflicting 1 hit which is worked out immediately.
Note that warriors cannot choose to leave a fight voluntarily.


### Leadership & psychology

#### The rout test

A player must make a Rout test at the start of his turn if a
quarter (25%) or more of his warband is out of action. For
example, in a warband that has twelve warriors a test is
needed if three or more are out of action. Even warbands who
are normally immune to psychology (such as Undead) must
make Rout tests.
If the Rout test is failed, the warband automatically loses the
fight. The game ends immediately and surviving warriors
retreat from the area. A failed Rout test is the most common
way in which a fight ends.
To take a Rout test roll 2D6. If the score is equal to or less
than the warband leader’s Leadership, the player has passed
the test and may continue to fight.
If the warband’s leader is out of action or stunned, then the
player may not use his Leadership to take the test. Instead,
use the highest Leadership characteristic amongst any
remaining fighters who are not stunned or out of action.

#### Voluntary rout

A player may choose to voluntarily Rout at the start of any of
his own turns if he wishes, but only if he was already
required to take a Rout test or if a quarter (25%) or more of
his warband are out of action.

#### Leaders

A warrior within 6" of his leader may use his leader’s
Leadership value when taking Leadership tests. This
represents the leader’s ability to encourage his warriors and
push them beyond normal limits.
A leader cannot confer this bonus if he is knocked down,
stunned or fleeing himself. The sight of your leader running
for cover is obviously far from encouraging!

#### All alone

Being outnumbered and alone is a nerve-racking situation for
any warrior.
If your warrior is fighting alone against two or more
opponents, and there are no friendly models within 6"
(knocked down, stunned or fleeing friends do not count), he
must make a test at the end of his combat phase. The test is
taken against the model’s Leadership on 2D6. If the warrior
scores equal to or under his Leadership his nerve holds. If the
score is greater than his Leadership, the warrior breaks from
combat and runs. Each one of his opponents may make one
automatic hit against him as he turns to run. If the model
survives, he runs 2D6" directly away from his enemies.
At the start of each of his turns, the warrior must take another
Leadership test. If he passes, he stops but can do nothing else
during his own turn except cast spells. If he fails or is
charged, he runs 2D6" towards the nearest table edge,
avoiding any enemy models. If he reaches the table edge
before he has managed to recover his nerves, he is removed
from combat.
If a warrior is charged while he is fleeing, the charger is
moved into base contact as normal, but the fleeing warrior
will then run a further 2D6" towards the table edge, before
any blows can be struck.

#### Fear

Fear is a natural reaction to huge or unnerving creatures. A
model must take a Fear test (i.e., test against his Leadership)
in the following situations. Note that creatures that cause fear
can ignore these tests.
a) If the model is charged by a warrior or a creature
which causes fear.
If a warrior is charged by an enemy that he fears then he must
take a test to overcome that fear. Test when the charge is
declared and is determined to be within range. If the test is
passed the model may fight as normal. If it is failed, the
model must roll 6s to score hits in that round of combat.
b) If the model wishes to charge a fear causing enemy.
If a warrior wishes to charge an enemy that it fears then it
must take a test to overcome this. If it fails the model may not
charge and must remain stationary for the turn. Treat this as a
failed charge.

#### Frenzy

Some warriors can work themselves into a berserk state of
fury, a whirlwind of destruction in which all concern for their
own personal safety is ignored in favour of mindless
violence. These warriors are described as being frenzied.
Frenzied models must always charge if there are any enemy
models within charge range (check after charges have been
declared). The player has no choice in this matter – the
warrior will automatically declare a charge.
Frenzied warriors fight with double their Attacks
characteristic in hand-to-hand combat. Warriors with 1
Attack therefore have 2 Attacks, warriors with 2 Attacks have
4, etc. If a warrior is carrying a weapon in each hand, he
receives +1 Attack for this as normal. This extra Attack is not
doubled.
Once they are within charge range, frenzied warriors are
immune to all other psychology, such as fear and don’t have
to take these tests as long as they remain within charge range.
If a frenzied model is knocked down or stunned, he is no
longer frenzied. He continues to fight as normal for the rest of
the battle.

#### Hatred

Hatred is a very powerful emotion, and during this era of
strife and war, bitter rivalry is commonplace.
Warriors who fight enemies they hate in hand-to-hand
combat may re-roll any misses when they attack in the first
turn of each hand-to-hand combat. This bonus applies only in
the first turn of each combat and represents the warrior
venting his pent-up hatred on his foe. After the initial round
of hand-to-hand combat he loses some impetus and
subsequently fights as normal for the rest of the combat.


#### Stupidity

Many large and powerful creatures, as well as some of the
more unhinged individuals in Mordheim, are unfortunately
rather stupid.
Models that are stupid test at the start of their turn to see if
they overcome their stupidity. Make a test for each model
affected by stupidity. If you pass the test by rolling their
Leadership value or less on 2D6 then all is well – the
creatures behave reasonably intelligently and the player may
move and fight with them as normal.
If the test is failed all is not well. Until the start of his next
turn (when it takes a new Stupidity test) the model will not
cast spells or fight in hand-to-hand combat (though his
opponent will still have to roll to hit him as normal).

If a model who fails a Stupidity test is not in hand-to-hand
combat, roll a D6.
1-3 The warrior moves directly forward at half speed in a
shambling manner. He will not charge an enemy (stop his
movement 1" away from any enemy he would have come
into contact with). He can fall down from the edge of a sheer
drop (see the Falling rules) or hit an obstacle, in which case
he stops. The model will not shoot this turn.
4-6 The warrior stands inactive and drools a bit during this
turn. He may do nothing else, as drooling is so demanding.
Regardless of whether the test is passed or failed, the result
applies until the start of the model’s following turn (when it
takes a new Stupidity test).
### Alignment

With so many warbands roaming in Mordheim and its
surrounding landscape and many of them having different
alignment, some warbands are Lawful while others are
Chaotic and then you have those that are Neutral. The
Alignment of a warband will help in many ways, like which
Hired Swords you can hire, the cost of hiring and upkeep of
Hired Swords, the maximum size of your Warband and other
bonuses. The Player must choose an alignment when they are
building a warband. Some warbands can only have one
alignment choice (i.e. all Witch Hunters warbands are always
Lawful).

#### Multi-player Games

In some Campaigns and Scenarios warbands may ally
themselves with other warbands, by doing this trust becomes
a problem, like Lawful warbands will not work alongside
Chaotic warbands, but both will work alongside a Neutral
warbands, this would be a distrusted alliance,

##### Distrusted Alliance

A Distrusted Alliance may form in many ways; the first is by
a Neutral warband allied with a Lawful or Chaotic warband,
the second is between races of the Dwarves and Elves, and
the third is between warbands that hate each other for some
reason.
If two distrusted alliance model are within 6” of each other
then both models have a -1 leadership penalty. They also stop
each other from running.

#### Bonuses

##### Lawful

The warbands that are Lawful aligned with other Lawful
warbands as well as Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands.
Hate all chaotic warbands. Lawful warbands get D3 rerolls
per battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if
not used in battle. All Neutral / Chaotic warbands will count
as being Chaotic in the eyes of Lawful warbands.

##### Lawful / Neutral

The warbands that are Lawful / Neutral aligned with other
Lawful / Neutral warbands as well as Lawful and Neutral
warbands. Lawful / Neutral warbands get 1 reroll per battle;
the reroll can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in
battle.

##### Neutral

The warbands that are Neutral aligned with any other
warbands including Lawful and Chaotic warbands.

##### Neutral / Chaotic

The warbands that are Neutral / Chaotic aligned with other
Neutral / Chaotic warbands as well as Neutral and Chaotic
warbands. Any member of a Neutral / Chaotic warband
which is afflicted by a mutation may still stay on the roster
even if normally he would have to leave. Neutral / Chaotic
warbands get 1 reroll per battle; the reroll can be uses in the
Exploration Phase if not used in battle.

##### Chaotic

The warbands that are Chaotic aligned with other Chaotic
warbands as well as Neutral and Neutral / Chaotic warbands.
Any member of a chaotic warband which is afflicted by a
mutation may still stay on the roster even if normally he
would have to leave. Chaotic warbands get D3 rerolls per
battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not
used in battle. All Lawful / Neutral warbands will count as
being Lawful in the eyes of chaotic warbands
