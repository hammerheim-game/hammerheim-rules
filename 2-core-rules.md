# Core Rules

## Tabletop conflict

In Mordheim, the opposing factions – warbands – are represented by models, assembled and painted by you, each representing a single warrior. Your tabletop becomes part of the City of the Damned: the scene of the action, with ruined buildings, overhangs and walkways where the battles take place. 

The aim of the game is to outfight your opponent, which requires a mixture of skill and luck. You'll soon learn how to arm and equip your warband effectively, and how to exploit the ruins and other terrain to your best advantage. 

You'll probably want to expand your basic warband as you and they gain experience. This is easy as there are lots of models available for the warbands and new miniatures will be coming out all the time. With these you can expand your warband, equip your warriors with different weapons and armor, and hire mercenaries to join them. 

## Building a warband

At first you will probably want to play individual games (see the Warbands section for more details) rather than a campaign. This will allow you to learn the rules, and also give you the opportunity to decide which type of warband is most suited to your particular style of play. 

If you are playing in a campaign, you will have the chance to expand and improve your warband after each game. By winning battles your warband will gain riches and wyrdstone, discover magical artefacts and may also have the opportunity to recruit mercenaries. 

In a campaign, every time your warband fights, its warriors gain in skill and experience. Raw recruits quickly progress to become fully fledged warriors, and your Heroes will learn new skills which will make them even better in combat. Each warband has its own objective and motivation for fighting in Mordheim: be it riches or political influence. Through countless battles and street skirmishes you can try to achieve your ambition and emerge victorious from the city! 

## New players

If you're new to Games Workshop games you'll be reassured to know that finding other players is not normally a problem - you'll be surprised how many there are!

There may be a Games Workshop store near to you where you can buy models, paint and games supplements. However Games Workshop stores are not just shops, they are hobby centres, where the staff will happily help you to learn the rules, show you how to paint, and suggest ways to develop your warband. 

## Warhammer players

If you already play Warhammer, the basic rules of Mordheim will be familiar to you. Remember though, Warhammer is designed for fighting battles between entire armies, whilst Mordheim represents individual action between a dozen or so warriors. 

As a result, some of the rules developed for mass combat in Warhammer do not apply to Mordheim, such as unit Break tests and rank bonuses. On the other hand, there are new rules for wounded warriors, climbing, parrying and other aspects of individual combat. 

## What you will need

As well as this book, you will need the following items to play Mordheim.

### Citadel models

You will need enough miniatures of the appropriate race/type to represent the warriors in your warband. It is a good idea to work out your warband on paper first and then purchase the miniatures that you require. Almost all possible weapon variations can be added using the Mordheim equipment spurs. 

 s you will see in the Warbands section, each warband fights in a particular way – some are expert bowmen while others are better in hand-to-hand combat. When choosing which warband you want to lead you could choose one that reflects your preferred playing style, or you could read the background section and choose one that really captures your imagination. A good way of picking a warband is simply to pick the one with the models you like the best. 

### Playing surface

You will also need something to play your battles on. Any firm, level surface is best, such as a tabletop or an area of floor – most kitchen tables will do. It's a good idea to use an old sheet or blanket to protect the table from scratches. Some players make a special gaming board from chipboard or other similar material (divided into two or more pieces for ease of storage) which they can use on top of a table to extend the playing area. Whatever you use, you will find that a square area approximately 4 x 4' is about right for most battles. 

### Terrain

The bitter struggles of a Mordheim battle take place in labyrinthine streets, ruined buildings and on derelict walkways. Pre-cut card and plastic scenery is available from Games Workshop, but many gamers enjoy making their own. 

As a rule, a table packed with scenery will lead to closer and more exciting games.

Throughout the book you will find photographs, drawings and descriptions of Mordheim. These should give you plenty of ideas for producing your own scenery. Games Workshop's book _'How to Make Wargames Terrain'_ is also a good source of ideas and practical hints. 

### Counters

Counters can help you keep track of things on the tabletop. You can always keep notes about who is hidden, carrying treasure, etc, but counters are a convenient memory jogger and speed the game up.  

\page

### Hidden Counter Wyrdstone Counter
Above are some examples of counters you could photocopy and stick onto thin card if you wish.

### Dice

All dice rolls use a standard six-sided dice (usually shortened to D6). Sometimes you will be asked to modify the result of the dice roll. This is noted as D6 plus or minus a number, such as D6 + 1 or D6 - 2. 

Roll the dice and add or subtract the number indicated to get the final result. You may have to roll a number of dice in one go. For example, 2D6 means roll two dice and add the scores together.

If you are given the opportunity to re-roll a dice roll, you must accept the second score, even if it's worse than the original. 

#### D3

You may come across the term D3. As there is no such thing as a three-sided dice, use the following method for determining a score between 1 and 3. Roll a D6 and halve the score, rounding up: 

| Roll | Result|
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 - 2  | 1 |
| 3 - 4  | 2 |
| 5 - 6  | 3 |

#### Artillery Dice

The Artillery Dice is one of the more specialised dice used in Games Workshop Games. The dice is a standard six-sided dice but featuring the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, with the final side is marked with misfire. A standard six-sided dice can be used in place of an Artillery Dice, just double the face value of the dice, and a Six would count as the Misfire. 

#### Scatter Dice

This is another more Specialise dice used in Games Workshop Games; this is a standard six-sided dice that has no numbers but has Arrows and a hit marker. A standard six-sided dice can be used in places of a Scatter Dice:

| Roll | Direction |
| : - : | : - : | 
| 1 | Top side |
| 2 | Right side |
| 3 | Bottom |
| 4  | Left side |
| 5 - 6 | Direct hit | 

### Tape measure

For measuring ranges you will need a tape measure marked in inches, or a couple of plastic range rulers.

### Other equipment

You will also need pens and paper to record details of your warriors' weapons and other details. You can use roster sheets for this, and blank ones are included at the back of this book. We recommend you photocopy them rather than use the originals. 

## Characteristics

In Mordheim the warriors each have different abilities, some being better at certain actions, for example, fighting, shooting or climbing, than they are at others. This variety in each warrior is represented in the form of characteristics and skills. Right now don't worry about skills – these come later with practice and battle experience. For now we just need to consider a warrior's characteristics. 

Each model is defined by a set of characteristics: Movement, Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, Initiative, Attacks and Leadership. Each characteristic is assigned a value of (usually) between 1 and 10. The higher the value your model has for any characteristic the better – for example, a model with a Strength of 6 is stronger than a model that has a Strength of 2. 

#### Movement (M)

A model's Movement rate shows how far the model can move in a turn, under normal conditions. For example, a typical Human has a move of 4", while a fleet-footed nimble Skaven has a move of 5". 

#### Weapon Skill (WS)

Weapon Skill is a measure of close combat ability (i.e., how good the warrior is at hand-to- hand fighting). A deadly swordsman or a crazed berserker would have a high value compared to a lowly acolyte, for example. The higher the WS, the more likely your warrior is to hit his opponent. 

#### Ballistic Skill (BS)

This shows how good a shot the individual is. When you shoot a bow or fire a pistol, the chance of hitting a target depends upon your model's Ballistic Skill. A normal Human has a BS of 3, though an experienced marksman might have a BS of 4, 5 or even higher. 

#### Strength (S)

Strength indicates how strong a warrior is! It is especially important for hand-to-hand combat, because the stronger you are the harder you can hit. A Strength value of 3 is about average. 

#### Toughness (T)

This is a measure of how easily an individual can withstand a hit from a weapon or a blow from a club or fist. The tougher you are, the harder you are to wound or kill. An average Toughness value is 3, though a gnarled old warrior might have a Toughness of 4! 

#### Wounds (W)

A model's Wounds value shows how many times the model can be wounded before it collapses, is killed or incapacitated. Most individuals have only 1 Wound but veteran warriors or large creatures such as Ogres might have more. 

\page

#### Initiative (I)

The Initiative value indicates how fast and nimble the warrior is. It determines the attacking order in hand-to-hand combat, and is particularly important when the model is climbing and moving amidst the ruins of Mordheim. 

#### Attacks (A)

The Attacks value indicates how many blows the model can make in hand-to-hand combat. Most warriors have an Attacks value of 1, but powerful fighters may have more. The more Attacks you have, the greater the chance you've got of beating your opponents into an unrecognisable pulp! 

#### Leadership (Ld)

Leadership represents raw courage, self control and charisma. The higher the model's Leadership value, the more likely he is to remain steadfast in combat while others run off or are slain. For example, a cowardly Skaven may have a Leadership of 5, while a cool, calm Elf could have a Leadership of 8 or higher. 

#### Zero level characteristics

Some creatures in Mordheim have been given a '0' for certain characteristics which means that they have no ability in that field whatsoever. This usually applies to creatures unable to use missile weapons (who would have a BS of 0) but it might equally apply to other characteristics as well. If a model has a WS of 0 then it cannot defend itself in hand- to-hand combat, and any blows struck against it will automatically hit. 

#### Characteristic profiles

A model's characteristic values are written in the form of a chart called a characteristics profile (or just profile).

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | 
| Dieter Stahl | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 7 |

The example above is a typical profile for a Human warrior. As you fight in more games against other players, your warriors will get better and their characteristics may increase. All these details are recorded using the Warband roster sheets provided at the back of this book. This is explained properly later on. For now it is enough to know what each characteristic is for and how their values vary. 

#### Characteristic tests

Often in the game a model will be required to take a test on one of his own characteristics. In order to pass this test, the model has to roll a D6 and obtain a result equal to or lower than the value of the characteristic involved. Note that if you roll a 6, you automatically fail the test regardless of the model's characteristic value. 

For example: Dieter Stahl is jumping down from a wall that is 3" high and has to take an Initiative test. He has an Initiative value of 3 on his characteristic profile and therefore will be successful if he rolls a 1, 2 or 3 on a D6. If he rolls a 4, 5 or 6 he will fail the test and fall down, suffering all the painful consequences! 

#### Leadership tests

Tests against the Leadership characteristic are done in a slightly different way. In the case of a Leadership test, you should roll two dice and add the two scores together. If the result is equal to or less than the model's Leadership characteristic, the test has been passed. 

For example: Dieter's Leadership is 7, so to pass a Leadership test he must roll 7 or less on 2D6.

#### Unit Size

| Unit type | Size |
| :-: | :-: |
| Infantry/war beasts/swarms | Small |
| Cavalry | Medium |
| Monstrous infantry | Large |
| Monstrous cavalry | Huge |
| Monsters | Gigantic |
| Ridden monsters | ...Wow |

### The Turn

In Mordheim you are in a charge of a warband and your opponent is in charge of another.

The warriors and scenery in the game are set up on the tabletop in a way that is appropriate for the encounter you are fighting. Do not worry about this for now as these things will be explained in full in the Scenarios section. 

To play, one side takes a turn, then the other side, then the original side and so on, much like in a game of draughts or chess. When it is your turn, you may move all your models, shoot with any warriors able to do so, and fight in hand-to- hand combat. Once your turn is complete, it is your opponent's turn to move, shoot and fight. 

#### Phases

To keep track of who is doing what and when, each turn is split into four phases. This is the _turn sequence_:

__1. Recovery:__ During this phase you deal with _incapacitated_ warriors, recovering models that are _knocked down_ or _stunned_, and attempting to rally _fleeing_ individuals.

__2. Movement:__ During this phase you may move the warriors of your warband according to the rules given in the Movement section.

__3. Shooting:__ In this phase you may shoot with any appropriate weapons as described in the rules for shooting.

__4. Hand-to-hand combat:__ During this phase all models in hand-to-hand combat may fight. Both sides fight in the hand-to-hand combat phase, regardless of whose turn it is.

#### Recovery phase

During the recovery phase, warriors in your warband who have been _stunned_ become _knocked down_ instead and warriors who have been _knocked down_ may stand up. For more details, see the _Injuries_ section.

\page

_Fleeing_ models must take a _leadership test_. If the test is passed, the model is no longer _fleeing_, but can do nothing this turn except cast spells. If the test is failed, the model will continue to _flee_ towards the closest table edge in the _compulsory move_ phase. For more details, see the rules for _fleeing_ in the _Leadership & psychology_ section.

### Movement

During the movement phase models are moved in the following order:

1. Charge!: If you want a model in your warband to charge at an enemy model and attack it in hand-to-hand combat then you must do this at the start of the movement phase before moving any of your other models. When you charge a model, declare to your opponent that you are doing so and indicate which of his models it is attacking.

2. Compulsory Moves: Sometimes a model is forced to move in a certain way and this is called a compulsory move. For example, a fighter whose nerve breaks must _flee_.

Make all of your models' compulsory moves before finishingany remaining movement.

3. Remaining Moves: Once you have moved your chargers and made any compulsory moves, you may move the rest of your warriors as you see fit.

#### Moving

During their movement phase, models can move up to movement rate their in any direction. They may move (including running and charging) up and down ladders and stairs, and over low obstacles such as barrels, boxes, etc. In normal circumstances models don't have to move their full distance, or at all if you do not want them to. All exceptions are explained later and invariably involve either charging or compulsory moves. 

#### Running

The normal Movement value of models represents a warrior moving at a fairly rapid rate, but allows time for him to aim and shoot a weapon and generally observe what is going on around him. If you wish, a model may move much quicker than this – he can run! A running warrior can move at double speed (for example, 8" rather than 4"). Note that running is not the same as charging as it does not allow your model to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. 

A model can only run if there are no enemy models within 8" of it at the start of the turn (_incapacitated_ and _hidden_ models do not count). Check this distance after any charges have been declared. If there are any enemies within 8" at the start of the turn, the model will prepare to fight instead and so is unable to run. The running model can move closer than 8" to an enemy as it moves. 

Any model that runs loses its chance to shoot during that turn. He is concentrating on running and is not prepared to fight, having sheathed or shouldered his weapons. You should declare that models are running as they move, as this will remind both players that the model is unable to shoot that turn. Running models can cast spells as normal. 

#### Charge!

If you want a model to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand
combat then you must make a special move called a charge.
Without measuring the distance, declare that your model is
charging and indicate which enemy model he is going to
attack. You can charge any opposing model if you can draw
an unobstructed line from your model to the target. If your
warrior wants to charge an enemy model within 4" that he

can't see (e.g., because it is behind a corner) but has not been
declared as hidden, he must pass an Initiative test to detect it.
If he fails the roll, your model may not charge this turn, but
may move his normal distance, shoot and cast spells.
A charge is like a running move, performed at double the
Movement rate, but ends with the attacker moving by the
most direct route into base-to-base contact with the enemy
model. Once their bases are touching they are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat. Models are also considered to be in
hand-to-hand combat even when separated by a low wall or
obstacle, where it is impossible for the bases to touch
physically because the obstacle is in the way.
 
If an unengaged (i.e., not in hand-to-hand combat) enemy
model lies within 2" of the charge route, that model may
choose to intercept the charger if he wishes. This
'interception area' is shown in the diagram above. Only one
enemy model may attempt to intercept each charger. If the
intercepting warrior would normally require a Fear test to
engage the charger then he must pass one in order to be
allowed to intercept. Failure means he will not move. If the
intercepting warrior causes fear then move the models into
contact and then take a Fear test for the original charger
(assuming he would normally do so) as if he was the one
being charged. Regardless of the results of this test it is still
the original charger who counts as charging in the subsequent
round of combat, not the intercepting warrior.

Sometimes a charging warrior may not reach the enemy
because you have miscalculated the distance. If this happens
move your warrior his normal move distance towards the
enemy. This is called a failed charge. The model cannot shoot
in the same turn in which he failed a charge, but he can cast
spells as normal.

Models cannot be moved into hand-to-hand combat except by charging – any move that brings a warrior into hand-to-hand combat is a charge by definition. A model that charges will 'strike first' in the first round of the ensuing combat.

#### Charging more than one opponent

If you can move your warrior into base contact with more than one enemy model with its charge move, it can charge them both. This might be inadvisable as it'll then be fighting two enemies at once!

#### Hiding

The Hiding rule represents warriors concealing themselves in a way that our unmoving and dramatically posed models cannot. A hiding warrior keeps as still as possible, just peeking out of cover. 

A model can hide if he ends his move behind a low wall, a column or in a similar position where he could reasonably conceal himself. The player must declare that the warrior is hiding and place a Hidden counter beside the model for it to count as being hidden. 

\page

A model that runs, flees, is _stunned_ or charges cannot hide that turn. His sudden burst of speed does not give him time to hide.

A model may stay hidden over several turns, so long as he
stays behind a wall or similar feature. He may even move
around so long as he stays hidden while doing so. If an
enemy moves so that he can see the hidden warrior, the
model is no longer hidden and the counter is removed. When
hidden, a warrior cannot be seen, shot at or charged.

While hiding, a model cannot shoot or cast spells without
giving away its position. If a hidden model shoots, or moves
so that he can be seen, he is no longer hidden and can be shot
at as normal.

A model may not hide if he is too close to an enemy model –
he will be seen or heard no matter how well concealed.
Enemy warriors will always see, hear or otherwise detect
hidden foes within their Initiative value in inches. So a
warrior whose Initiative value is 3 will automatically spot all
hidden enemies within 3".

#### Terrain

The ruined city of Mordheim is a dark and dangerous place,
where tumbled down towers and blasted houses form a vast
maze of streets and alleyways.

OPEN GROUND: The tabletop surface, floors of buildings,
connecting overhangs, ladders and ropes are all considered to
be open ground and will not affect movement even if the
model is charging. It can also go through doors and hatches
without slowing down.

DIFFICULT GROUND: Difficult ground includes steep or
treacherous slopes, bushes and the angled roofs of buildings.
Models move at half speed over difficult terrain.

VERY DIFFICULT GROUND: This is really dangerous
terrain, such as narrow crawl holes through the rubble.
Models may move at a quarter rate, so if the model moves 4"
over open ground it can only move 1" over very difficult
ground.

WALLS AND BARRIERS: Walls, hedges and other low
obstacles form barriers that you can either go around or leap
over. A model can leap over a barrier that is less than 1" high.
This does not affect its movement in any way.

#### Climbing

Often the ruined buildings of Mordheim do not have stairs or
ladders, so your warriors will have to climb to reach the
upper floors of buildings.

Any model (except animals!) can climb up or down fences,
walls, etc. He must be touching what he wants to climb at the
start of his movement phase. He may climb up to his total
Movement in a single movement phase (but cannot run while
he is climbing). Any remaining movement can be used as
normal. If the height is more than the model's normal move,
he cannot climb the wall.

To climb, a model must take an Initiative test. If he fails it
whilst climbing up, he cannot move that turn. If he fails it
while climbing down, he falls from where he started his
descent (see the Falling section).

#### Jumping down

Your warrior may jump down from high places (up to a maximum height of 6") such as walkways and balconies at any time during his movement phase. 

Take an Initiative test for every full 2" he jumps down. If he fails any of the tests, the model falls from the point where he jumped, takes damage (see Falling) and may not move any more during the movement phase. If successful, the model can continue his movement as normal (jumping down does not use up any of the model's Movement allowance). 

#### Diving charge

You may charge any enemy troops that are below a balcony or overhang, etc, that your model is on. If an enemy model is within 2" of the place where your warrior lands, he may make a diving charge against it. Take an Initiative test for each full 2" of height your model jumped down from, up to a maximum of 6", like a normal jump. If he fails any of them, your model has fallen and suffers damage, may not move any more during the movement phase and cannot charge the enemy. If he succeeds, the model gains a +1 Strength bonus and +1 to hit bonus but only during the following hand-to- hand combat phase. 

#### Jumping over gaps

Models may traverse gaps of up to 3" wide substituted from their base movement as if they were climbing. Jumps may only be horizontal or downwards (with falls of more than 1" requiring an initiative test upon landing). A model may jump over a gap and still fire a missile weapon if it is not running. It may also jump as part of its
charge or running move.

#### Warriors knocked down or stunned

If a warrior is _knocked down_ or _stunned_ (see the Shooting section for details) within 1" of the edge of a roof or building, there is a chance that it will slip and fall off. Take an Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model falls over the edge to the ground and takes damage as detailed below. 

#### Falling

A model that falls takes D3 hits at a Strength equal to the
height in inches that it fell (e.g., if the model fell 4", it would
take D3 hits at Strength 4). No armor saves apply. Falling
will not cause critical hits (see the Hand-to-Hand Combat
section for the Critical Hits rules). A model that falls may not
move any further or hide during that turn, even if it is not
hurt.

#### Swimming

Players should establish which way the river is flowing at the
start of the game. To represent how models interact with
water these basic rules apply:

1. All rivers count as difficult (or worse) terrain for all
    models except those considered as aquatic.
2. Models swimming with the current will double their
    base move.
3. Models swimming against the current of a slow
    moving river may only move a quarter of their base
    move, but you may not swim against the current of a
    fast moving river.
4. Aquatic models suffer no reduction of their base move
    when swimming against the current of a slow moving
    river but may not swim against the current of a fast
    moving river.
5. Models wearing armor may not attempt to move
    through any water deeper than shallow. Shields and
    bucklers do not count for this as they are assumed to
    be strapped on the backs.

\page

Aquatic models in water, either swamp, streams or rivers can elect to be Hidden at the discretion of the player. Models cannot move upstream in fast moving rivers without floating transportation, such as a boat or canoe. 

### Shooting

Warriors that fight in the ruins of Mordheim are usually armed to the teeth! Individual warriors often have several different weapons such as swords, knives, bows and even blackpowder weapons. 

During your warband's shooting phase each of your warriors may shoot once with one of his weapons. This means that he can fire a bow, shoot with a crossbow, or hurl a throwing knife, for example. 

Work through the models one at a time. Pick which fighter is going to shoot, nominate his target, work out whether he hits the enemy and, if he does, any wounds or injuries that are caused. Then continue with the next shooter. You can take shots in any order you wish. Be sure to remember or note down which models have already shot. 

#### Who can shoot

Each model can shoot once in the shooting phase, so long as he can see a target and assuming he has a suitable weapon. He may not fire in the following circumstances: if he is engaged in hand-to-hand combat, has run or failed a charge in the movement phase, has rallied this turn or is _stunned_ or _knocked down_. 

To shoot at a target, a model must be able to see it, and the only way to check this is to stoop over the tabletop for a model's eye view. Models can see all around themselves (i.e., 360°), and they may be turned freely to face in any direction before firing. Note that turning on the spot does not count as moving. 

#### Closest target

You must shoot at the closest standing enemy, as he represents the most immediate threat and therefore the most obvious target. However, you may shoot at a more distant target if it is easier to hit or if closer models are _stunned_ or _knocked down_ (see diagram on next page). For example, a closer target may be hard to hit because it is in cover, whilst a more distant target might be in the open and therefore an easier shot. You may always choose to shoot at a Large Target if you can see it, whether it is in cover or not and even if it is not the closest target. 

You can shoot at models that are _incapacitated_, but you can choose to ignore them, because they do not represent an immediate threat. It is better to shoot the closest standing enemy model instead.

You may not shoot at models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat, as the risk of hitting your comrades is too great.

#### Cover

The many walls, ruined buildings and other masonry in Mordheim offer plenty of cover. If any portion of the target is hidden by a piece of scenery or another model, the shooting model will suffer a penalty as explained below. 

Sometimes it will be obvious whether a target can be seen; at other times it will be more difficult, as buildings and other scenery are in the way. If the shooter can see only part of the target's body, the target is in cover and the shooter suffers a - 1 penalty on his To Hit roll. 

If a shot misses its target by 1, and that target claimed the - modifier for cover, then the shot strikes the cover instead. Normally this doesn't matter, but in the case where a model is concealed behind another warrior, or when the cover is a powder keg, it might be extremely important! 

#### Shooting from an elevated position

A model situated in an elevated position (i.e., anything that is more than 2" above the table surface, such as an upper floor of a building), may freely pick any target he can see and shoot at it. The exception to this rule is that if there are enemies in the same building and in line of sight of the shooter, he must shoot at these, as they present a more immediate threat. 

#### Range

Once you have decided to shoot and have chosen a target you must measure to see whether the shot is within range. Each type of missile weapon has a maximum range, as described in the Weapons & Armor section of the book.

Assuming that your target is within range your warrior can proceed with the shot. If the target is out of range then he has automatically missed this turn.

#### Hitting the target

To determine whether a shot hits its target, roll a D6. The
dice score needed will depend upon how good a shot the
shooter is (as indicated by his Ballistic Skill). The chart
below shows the minimum D6 roll needed to score a hit.


| BS of shooter | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | 
| D6 roll needed | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | -1 | -2 | - |

#### Hit modifiers

It is easier to hit a target that is in the open compared to a
target behind cover. Usually it is also easier to hit a target if it
is close compared to one further away. These situations are
represented by the following modifiers:

\page

| Condition | Description | Modifier |
| : - : | : - : | : - : | 
| Cover | If any part of the model is obscured by scenery or other models then it counts as being in cover | -1 |
| Long range | If you are shooting at a target that is more than half of your weapon's maximum range away | -1 |
| Moving | If your model has moved at all shooting (other than standing up, or turning to face your target) during this turn | -1 |
| Large Target | If either the target model has the Large Target special rule (such as an Ogre), or whose main 'body' is over 2" tall or wide (such as most buildings) | -1 |

#### Roll to Wound

Once you have hit a target test to see if a wound is inflicted. A shot may fail to cause a wound because it hits part of the target's equipment, just scratches the skin or causes some very minor injury which the warrior bravely (or stupidly) ignores. If you fail to cause a wound, the target is unharmed. To determine whether your shot has caused a wound, compare the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of the target. You will find a complete description of the various  weapons together with their Strength values and special rules in the Weapons & Armor section.

The chart above shows the D6 score required to turn a hit into a wound Note that a dash (–) means that there is no chance of wounding the target. 

Deploying your archers in the upper floors of buildings is a good idea. They will be in cover and can freely pick their targets.

#### Critical Hits

If you roll a 6 when rolling to wound (for hand-to-hand combat and shooting only) you will cause a critical hit. Roll a D6 and consult the Critical Hit chart below to determine the damage caused by the critical hit. You should also roll to see whether the target makes its armor save or suffers damage as normal. 

In addition, if the attacker normally needs 6s to wound his target, he cannot cause a critical hit. His opponent is simply too tough to suffer a serious injury at the hands of such a puny creature! 

Each warrior may only cause one critical hit in each hand-to- hand combat phase (see the Close Combat section), so if he has several attacks, the first 6 you roll to wound will cause a critical hit. 

Depending on what weapon your warrior is using, you may roll on one of the following Critical Hit charts. For example, if your warrior is using a sword, roll on the Bladed Weapons chart. All the rules governing critical hits given in the main rules also apply to these tables.

<br/>

##### Missile weapons

_(Bows, crossbows, blackpowder weapons, throwing knives etc.)_

| Roll | Type | Description |
| :-: | : - : | : - : | 
| 1-2 | Hits a Weak Spot | The missile penetrates its target's armor. Ignore all armor saves. |
| 3-4 | Ricochet | If there are any other models within 6", the closest enemy model is also hit. Roll to wound and take any saves as normal for both targets. |
| 5-6 | Master Shot | The missile hits an eye, the throat, or some other vulnerable part. The target suffers 2 wounds instead of 1. There is no armor save. |

##### Bludgeoning weapons

_(Clubs, maces, hammers, flails, double-handed hammers etc.)_

| Roll | Type | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | Hammered | The target is knocked off balance. Your opponent may not fight this turn if he hasn't already fought. |
| 3-4 | Clubbed | The hit ignores armor saves and saves from helmets.
| 5 | Wild Sweep | Your opponent's weapon is knocked from his hand. If he is carrying two weapons, roll to see which one he loses. He must fight with whatever back-up weapon he has in his equipment for the rest of this combat (or fight unarmed if he has no other weapons). Roll to wound and take armor saves as normal. |
| 6 | Bludgeoned | The victim automatically goes out of action if he fails his armor save. Even if he has several wounds remaining, he will be taken out of action by this attack. |

##### Bladed weapons

_(Swords, axes, double-handed swords etc.)_

| Roll | Type | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | Flesh Wound | This attack hits an unprotected area, so there is no armor save. |
| 3-4 | Bladestorm | The warrior unleashes a virtual hail of blows. The attack causes 2 wounds instead of 1. Take armor saves separately for each wound. Remember that, as with other critical hits, if an attack causes multiple wounds for other reasons as well, you choose the highest number of wounds. |
| 5-6 | Sliced! | The strike ignores armor saves, causes 2 wounds, and your warrior gains +2 to any Injury rolls. |

\page

##### Unarmed combat

_(War dogs, warhorses, Zombies, Possessed, animals etc.)_

| Roll | Type | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | Body Blow | Your opponent staggers, allowing you to seize the initiative and make an additional attack. Immediately roll to hit and to wound. Any saves are taken as normal. |
| 3-4 | Crushing Blow | The blow lands with tremendous force. You gain +1 to the Injury roll if your opponent fails his save. |
| 5-6 | Mighty Blow | With a mighty punch or flying kick, you send your opponent sprawling to the ground. The attack ignores armor saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. |

##### Thrusting weapons

_(Spears, halberds, lances etc.)_

| Roll | Type | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | Stab | With a quick strike, you penetrate your opponent's defences. You gain +1 to any Injury rolls. Armor saves are taken as normal. |
| 3-4 | Thrust | The thrust lands with great force and the target is _knocked down_. Take armor saves as normal and see whether the model suffers a wound. |
| 5-6 | Kebab! | The thrust knocks the target back with titanic force, ripping apart armor and puncturing flesh. The attack ignores armor saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. The victim is knocked backwards D6" and the attacker follows, staying in base contact. Any other models involved in the combat are separated and only the model which struck the blow and his target are still considered to be in combat. If the target collides with another model, the other model is hit once at S3. |

#### Armor

Steel breastplates, chainmail, leather tunics, shields... all these and more are readily available in the forges of the villages surrounding Mordheim. That is if you are prepared to pay the price, since armor is very expensive. 

 f a warrior wearing armor suffers a wound roll a D6. If the dice roll is sufficiently high the wounding hit has bounced off the armor and has not hurt the wearer at all. The dice score required varies according to the type of armor. 

 he table below summarises the most common armor types and the D6 rolls required to make a save. Note that carrying a shield increases the save by +1. For example, a warrior in light armor with a shield will save on a roll of a 5 or 6. A warrior who has a shield but no armor will save on a roll of a 6. 
 
D6 score Armor required to save:

| Armor | Save |
| :-: | :-: |
| Light armor | 6+ |
| Heavy armor | 5+ |
| Gromril armor | 4+ |

Shield adds +1 to the armor save

#### Armor save modifiers

Some weapons are better at penetrating armor than others. A shot from a short bow can be deflected relatively easily, but a shot from a crossbow penetrates armor much more effectively.

The higher a weapon's Strength, the more easily it can pierce armor. The chart below shows the reduction to the enemy's armor saving throw for different Strength weapons.

| Strength | Save modifier |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1- 3 | None |
| 4 | - |
| 5 | - |
| 6 | - |
| 7 | - |
| 8 | - |
| 9+ | - |

Some weapons are better at penetrating armor than their Strength value suggests (Elven bows, for example). This is covered in the entry for each particular weapon (see the Weapons & Armor section). 

_Example: Dieter wears heavy armor and carries a shield. His armor save is 4+. He is hit by a crossbow (Strength 4) and therefore he will save on a D6 roll of 5+ (i.e., 4+ 1 = 5+). _

#### Injuries

Most warriors have a Wounds characteristic of 1, but some have a value of 2 or more. If the target has more than 1 wound then deduct 1 from his total each time he suffers a wound. Make a note on the roster sheet. So long as the model has at least 1 wound remaining he may continue to fight. As soon as a fighter's Wounds are reduced to zero, roll to determine the extent of his injuries. The player who inflicted the wound rolls a D6 for the wound that reduced the model to zero wounds and for every wound the model receives after that. If a model suffers several wounds in one turn, roll once for each of them and apply the highest result. 

| Roll | Result | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | Knocked down | The force of the blow knocks the warrior down. Place the model face up to show that he has been _knocked down_. |
| 3-4 | Stunned | The target falls to the ground where he lies wounded and barely conscious. Turn the model face down to show that he has been _stunned_. |
| 5-6 | Out of action | The target has been badly hurt and falls to the ground unconscious. He takes no further part in the game and is immediately removed from the battle. |

\page

#### Knocked down

A fighter who has been _knocked down_ falls to the ground either because of a jarring blow he has sustained, because he has slipped, or because he has thrown himself to the ground to avoid injury. Turn the model face up to show that he has been _knocked down_. Knocked down models may crawl 2" during the movement phase, but may not fight in hand-to- hand combat, shoot or cast spells. If he is in base-to-base contact with an enemy, a _knocked down_ model can crawl 2" away only if the enemy is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with another opponent, otherwise he has to stay where he is. In combat he cannot strike back and the enemy will have a good chance of putting him out of action (see the _Attacking knocked down warriors_ section of the Close Combat rules on page 13). 

A warrior who has been _knocked down_ may stand up at the start of his next turn. In that turn he may move at half rate, shoot and cast spells, he cannot charge or run. If he is engaged in hand-to-hand combat, he may not move away and will automatically strike last, irrespective of weapons or Initiative. After this turn the fighter moves and fights normally, even though he has zero wounds left. If the model takes any further wounds, then roll for injury once more, exactly as if the model had just sustained its last wound. 

#### Stunned

When a warrior is stunned, he is either badly injured or temporarily knocked out. Turn the model face down to show that he has been _stunned_. A fighter who is _stunned_ may do nothing at all. A player may turn the model face up in the next recovery phase, and the warrior is then treated as _knocked down_.

#### Out of action

A warrior who is out of action is also out of the game. Remove the model from the tabletop. It's impossible to tell at this point whether the warrior is alive or dead, but for game purposes it makes no difference at this stage. After the battle you can test to see whether he survives and if he sustains any serious lasting injuries as a result of his wounds (see page 170 for details). 

### Close Combat

#### Who can fight

Models whose bases are touching are engaged in hand-to-hand combat. This can only happen once a warrior has charged his enemy, as models are otherwise not allowed to move into contact.

All close quarter fighting is worked out in the hand-to-hand combat phase. Regardless of whose turn it is, all models in hand-to-hand combat will fight. A warrior can fight against enemies to his side, front, or rear. In reality the fighters are constantly moving, dodging, and weaving as they struggle to kill their adversaries. 

Models fighting in hand-to-hand combat do not shoot in the shooting phase. They are far too busy fighting for their lives. Any very close range shots they are able to make using pistols are treated like close combat weapon attacks (see the Weapons & Armor section). 

#### Incapacitated

A model that is _fleeing_, _knocked down_, or _Stunned_ counts as Incapacitated and cannot fight.

#### Who strikes first

Models fight in order of descending Initiative with the highest striking first. If their Initiatives are equal, roll a dice to see who strikes first. 

If a model stood up in the Recovery phase of that turn, then he will strike last irrespective of any other circumstances. 

Sometimes a model will be allowed to 'strike first' for some reason. Most commonly this is because they charged in that turn, but some equipment, skills and spells produce the same effect. If only one model 'strikes first' then it does so and the remainder of the combatants strike in Initiative order as described above. 

If there are several models who are each entitled to 'strike first', then they determine the order of combat between themselves by Initiative, as described above. Once all those that were eligible to 'strike first' have fought, any other combatants fight in Initiative order. 

##### Which models fight

A model can fight if its base is touching the base of an enemy model. Even models attacked from the side or rear can fight. If a warrior is touching more than one enemy, he can choose which to attack. If he has more than 1 Attack, he can divide them in any way the player wishes, so long as he makes this clear before rolling to hit. 

#### Hitting the enemy

To determine whether hits are scored, roll a D6 for each model fighting. If a model has more than 1 Attack roll a D for each attack.

The dice roll needed to score a hit on your enemy depends upon the Weapon Skills of the attacker and the foe. Compare the Weapon Skill of the attacker with that of his opponent and consult the To Hit chart below to find the minimum D score needed to hit. 

##### Fighting with two weapons

Some maniac warriors carry two weapons, one in each hand, so they can rain a flurry of blows on their enemies. A warrior armed with two one-handed weapons may make 1 extra Attack with the additional weapon though will suffer -1 WS to compensate for the difficulty in making precision blows while flailing wildly. Note that this is added to the total of the warrior's attacks after other modifiers, such as frenzy, have been applied. If he is armed with two different weapons (sword and dagger, for example), he will make a single attack with whichever weapon he chooses, and all others with the remaining weapon. Roll to hit and wound for each weapon separately. 

#### Weapon modifiers

Unlike hits from shooting, the Strength of the attacker is used to determine wounds, rather than that of the weapon itself. However, some weapons confer a bonus on the attacker's Strength (see the Weapons & Armor section for full details). 

#### Roll to wound

Once your model has hit a target you must test to see whether a wound is inflicted. Sometimes a strike may fail to wound simply because it causes an insignificant injury or glances off the enemy's equipment. 

\page

To determine whether the blow has caused a wound compare the Strength of the weapon with the Toughness of the target. You will find a complete description of the various weapons together with their Strength values and special rules in the Weapons & Armor section. 

Follow the same procedure for wounding and causing critical hits as in the Shooting section. Note that a dash (–) means that there is no chance of wounding the target.

#### Armor

Combatants that are wounded have the chance to avoid damage if they are wearing armor or carrying shields. This is exactly the same as described for shooting, and the same rules apply.

For each wound suffered the player rolls a D6. If he rolls greater than or equal to the armor save of his fighter then that wound has been absorbed or deflected by the armor.

#### Armor save modifiers

Some models are so powerful that armor provides less protection against them.

The higher a creature's Strength the more easily it can pierce armor. The following chart shows the reduction in the enemy's armor saving throw caused by the attacker's Strength.

| Strength | Save modifier |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1-3 | None |
| 4 | - |
| 5 | - |
| 6 | - |
| 7 | - |
| 8 | - |
| 9+ | - |

Some weapons also confer a bonus to the user's Strength, making it more likely that any hits will pierce the opponent's armor. These bonuses are given in the Weapons & Armor section.

#### Parry

Bucklers are small shields which offer no increase to the armor saving throw, but allow you to parry attacks. Swords are also used to parry enemy attacks.

When an opponent scores a hit, warriors equipped with bucklers or swords may try to parry the blow.

Roll a D6. If the score is higher than the number your opponent rolled to hit, the buckler or sword has parried the strike. Note that it is therefore impossible to parry a blow which scored a 6 on the roll to hit.

A buckler or sword may only parry one blow per hand-to- hand combat phase. A parried blow is ignored and has no effect. If your opponent scored several hits, you will have to try to beat the highest score (if the highest score is a 6, you automatically lose the chance of parrying that opponent's attacks). If a model is fighting against several opponents, it may only parry the strike from the enemy who makes the first hit(s) (i.e., the attacking model with the highest Initiative). In the case of equal Initiative characteristics roll a dice to decide who strikes first. 

If your model is armed with a buckler and a sword, you may re-roll any failed parries once. A model armed with two swords can still only roll once, but may add +1 to the results. A model may not parry attacks made with twice (or more) his own basic Strength – they are simply too powerful to be stopped. 

#### Attacking knocked down warriors

If an enemy is fighting a warrior who is _knocked down_, he may attack him to put him out of his misery. If any of the attacks wound the _knocked down_ model and he fails his armor save, he is automatically taken out of action as explained previously. A _knocked down_ model may not parry. 

#### Attacking stunned warriors

A _stunned_ warrior is at the mercy of his enemies. Attacks against _stunned_ warriors automatically hit, but otherwise follow the same rules for Knocked Down.

#### Attacking _stunned_ and _knocked down_ warriors

A model with multiple attacks may not stun/knock down and then automatically take a warrior out of action during the same hand-to-hand combat phase. The only way you can achieve this is to have more than one of your models attacking the same enemy. If the enemy is stunned/knocked down by the first warrior, he can be hit and put out of action by the _next_ warrior to attack. 

If your model is engaged in close combat with an enemy who is still standing, he cannot attack any other models that are _stunned_ or _knocked down_, since in reality they will not pose an immediate threat to him and their companions will try to protect them. 

#### Moving from combat

Once models are engaged in hand-to-hand combat they cannot move away during their movement phase. They must fight until they are either taken out of action, until they take out their enemies, or until one or the other breaks and runs. The exception to this rule is that if all a model's close combat opponents are _knocked down_ or stunned, he may move away from the combat if you wish, and even charge other enemies within range. 

#### Breaking from combat

A warrior who panics whilst fighting in hand-to-hand combat will break off and make a run for it as described in the Leadership & Psychology section.

When a fighter breaks from combat he simply turns and runs off. His opponents automatically hit the warrior as he breaks, each inflicting 1 hit which is worked out immediately.

_Note:_ warriors cannot choose to leave a fight voluntarily.

\page

### Leadership & psychology

#### The rout test

A player must make a Rout test at the start of his turn if a quarter (25%) or more of his warband is out of action. For example, in a warband that has twelve warriors a test is needed if three or more are out of action. Even warbands who are normally immune to psychology (such as Undead) must make Rout tests. 

If the Rout test is failed, the warband automatically loses the fight. The game ends immediately and surviving warriors retreat from the area. A failed Rout test is the most common way in which a fight ends. 

To take a Rout test roll 2D6. If the score is equal to or less than the warband leader's Leadership, the player has passed the test and may continue to fight. 

If the warband's leader is out of action or stunned, then the player may not use his Leadership to take the test. Instead, use the highest Leadership characteristic amongst any remaining fighters who are not _stunned_ or out of action. 

#### Voluntary rout

A player may choose to voluntarily Rout at the start of any of his own turns if he wishes, but only if he was already required to take a Rout test or if a quarter (25%) or more of his warband are out of action.

#### Leaders

A warrior within 6" of his leader may use his leader's Leadership value when taking Leadership tests. This represents the leader's ability to encourage their warriors and push them beyond normal limits. 

A leader cannot confer this bonus if they are _incapacitated_. The sight of your leader running for cover is obviously far from encouraging!

#### Fleeing

If a warrior _flees_ from combat, each enemy warrior in base contact makes one automatic hit against the _fleeing_ warrior as they turn to run. If the model survives, they flee 2D6" towards the nearest table edge, avoiding any enemy models.

At the start of each of their turns, a _fleeing_ warrior must take a _leadership test_. If they pass, they no longer count as fleeing, but can do nothing during the rest of this turn except cast spells. 

If they fail, they will flee _2D6"_ towards the nearest table edge in the _compulsory move_ phase. If they reach the table edge before they have managed to recover their nerves, they are removed from the board.

If a warrior is charged while they are _fleeing_, the charger is moved into base contact as normal, but the _fleeing_ warrior will then move an additional _2D6"_ towards the table edge immediately.

#### All alone

Being outnumbered and alone is a nerve-racking situation for any warrior. If your warrior is fighting alone against two or more opponents of the same or larger size (refer to the model size chart), and there are no friendly models (_incapacitated_ models do not count) within _6"_, they must make a _leadership test_ at the end of their combat phase.

If the warrior passes the test, their nerve holds. If the warrior fails, the warrior breaks from combat and _flees_.

#### Fear

_Fear_ is a natural reaction to huge or unnerving creatures. A model, unless they cause Fear themselves, must take a _leadership test_, in the following situations:

1. If the model is charged by a warrior or a creature which causes fear. If a warrior is charged by an enemy that he fears then he must take a test to overcome that fear. Test when the charge is declared and is determined to be within range. If the test is passed the model may fight as normal. If it is failed, the model must roll _6_s to score hits in that round of combat. 

2. If the model wishes to charge a fear-causing enemy. If a warrior wishes to charge an enemy that it fears then it must take a test to overcome this. If it fails, the model may not charge and must remain stationary for the turn. Treat this as a failed charge. 

#### Terror

Terror causing models are even more frightening than fear causing ones and represent the mind-shattering and traumatising sort of creatures of which legends are told. Monsters that cause Terror will inflict the fear status even on units that cause fear themselves or are immune to fear (such as with Hardened). Immunity to Psychology will negate Terror as normal.

#### Frenzy

Some warriors can work themselves into a berserk state of fury, a whirlwind of destruction in which all concern for their own personal safety is ignored in favour of mindless violence. 

These warriors are described as being frenzied. Frenzied models must always charge if there are any enemy models within charge range (check after charges have been declared). The player has no choice in this matter – the warrior will automatically declare a charge. 

Frenzy grants the warrior +1A to their profile. Once they are within charge range, frenzied warriors are immune to all other psychology, such as fear and don't have to take these tests as long as they remain within charge range. If a frenzied model is _incapacitated_, he no longer counts as frenzied for the rest of this battle. 

#### Hatred

Hatred is a very powerful emotion, and during this era of strife and war, bitter rivalry is commonplace. Warriors who fight enemies they hate in hand-to-hand combat may re-roll any misses when they attack in the first turn of each hand-to-hand combat. This bonus applies only in the first turn of each combat and represents the warrior venting his pent-up hatred on his foe. After the initial round of hand-to-hand combat he loses some impetus and subsequently fights as normal for the rest of the combat. 

#### Stupidity

Many large and powerful creatures, as well as some of the more unhinged individuals in Mordheim, are unfortunately rather stupid. 

Models with the Stupidity rule are incapable of taking any voluntary action unless a model without Stupidity (who is not _Incapacitated_) is within 6" of them at the start of their turn. 

\page

### Alignment

With so many warbands roaming in Mordheim and its surrounding landscape and many of them having different alignment, some warbands are Lawful while others are Chaotic and then you have those that are Neutral. The Alignment of a warband will help in many ways, like which Hired Swords you can hire, the cost of hiring and upkeep of Hired Swords, the maximum size of your Warband and other bonuses. The Player must choose an alignment when they are building a warband. Some warbands can only have one alignment choice (i.e. all Witch Hunters warbands are always Lawful). 

#### Multi-player Games

In some Campaigns and Scenarios warbands may ally themselves with other warbands, by doing this trust becomes a problem, like Lawful warbands will not work alongside Chaotic warbands, but both will work alongside a Neutral warbands, this would be a distrusted alliance.

##### Distrusted Alliance

A Distrusted Alliance may form in many ways; the first is by a Neutral warband allied with a Lawful or Chaotic warband, the second is between races of the Dwarves and Elves, and the third is between warbands that hate each other for some reason. 

If two distrusted alliance model are within 6” of each other then both models have a -1 leadership penalty. They also stop each other from running. 

#### Bonuses

##### Lawful

The warbands that are Lawful aligned with other Lawful warbands as well as Lawful / Neutral and Neutral warbands. Hate all chaotic warbands. Lawful warbands get D3 rerolls per battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in battle. All Neutral / Chaotic warbands will count as being Chaotic in the eyes of Lawful warbands. 

##### Lawful / Neutral

The warbands that are Lawful / Neutral aligned with other Lawful / Neutral warbands as well as Lawful and Neutral warbands. Lawful / Neutral warbands get 1 reroll per battle; the reroll can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in battle.

##### Neutral

The warbands that are Neutral aligned with any other warbands including Lawful and Chaotic warbands.

##### Neutral / Chaotic

The warbands that are Neutral / Chaotic aligned with other Neutral / Chaotic warbands as well as Neutral and Chaotic warbands. Any member of a Neutral / Chaotic warband which is afflicted by a mutation may still stay on the roster even if normally he would have to leave. Neutral / Chaotic warbands get 1 reroll per battle; the reroll can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in battle. 

##### Chaotic

The warbands that are Chaotic aligned with other Chaotic warbands as well as Neutral and Neutral / Chaotic warbands. Any member of a chaotic warband which is afflicted by a mutation may still stay on the roster even if normally he would have to leave. Chaotic warbands get D3 rerolls per battle; the rerolls can be uses in the Exploration Phase if not used in battle. All Lawful / Neutral warbands will count as being Lawful in the eyes of chaotic warbands
