### Optional Rules

This section includes a variety of rules that add an extra
dimension to your battles in Mordheim. As they are additions
to the basic rules they are not an essential part of the game,
and you should agree with your opponent beforehand
whether you are going to use any of them.
We recommend that new players ignore this section to begin
with, at least until you are familiar with the way the game
works. If you consider yourself to be an experienced gamer
then you’ll have no problem incorporating these elements.
Some of these additional rules alter the game quite
dramatically, and you are under no obligation to use any of
them. They have simply been included for players who want
to explore different aspects of the game.

#### Random Happenings

Mordheim is a dark and sinister city – dangers lurk around every corner. Even the basic laws of nature cannot be relied upon.
Mark Havener and Tim Huckelbery explain how these dangers can be introduced to your battles.
These rules represent the weird and wonderful things that can
happen in Mordheim which are beyond the control of players.
These rules are intended to be optional and should only be
used if agreed on by all players taking part. To determine if a
random encounter occurs, roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. A result of 1 indicates a random encounter.
Roll a D66 for the random encounter on the chart opposite to
see what exactly is encountered and follow the directions.
The player whose turn it is places any models that represent
the encounter and they will act in each of his turns (that
player doesn’t control their actions though, see the individual
descriptions to see how the models act). This player is known
as the ‘Encountering Player’, even though random encounters
will frequently affect only his opponent or both players
indiscriminately. The models that represent a random
encounter must all be placed within 6" of a randomly
determined board edge and they will remain within 2" of
another member of their group at all times. Random

encounter members must be placed (and will remain, unless
their description indicates otherwise) at ground level in the
open. The Encountering Player places the models
representing the random encounter, but note that they cannot
initially be placed within 12" of any warband models.
After being placed, many encounters will travel as quickly as
possible (without running) towards the nearest warband
model. For this purpose the nearest model is the model that
the encounter can reach most quickly and encounter models
will never climb the sides of a building to get at a warband
member. What each encounter does from there is listed in its
description. Note that charging models will engage as many
warband members as they can reach, ganging up if some of
them can’t reach different models. No more than one random
encounter will ever take place in a single game, so after a
random encounter is rolled, the players no longer need to roll
at the start of their turns. Several of the entries below refer to
game turns, this includes both players’ turns.
###### Random Encounters Chart

Roll D66

11 Ogre Mercenary
An Ogre Mercenary (see the Hired Swords section of the Mordheim
rules for details on the Ogre Mercenary) appears further down the
street. Sensing trouble brewing, he decides to seize the opportunity
and offer his services to the warband with the lowest warband rating
(if there are two warbands with the same rating, roll a dice to see
whom he offers his help to). The warband that he offers to help must
add the Hired Sword to its roster for this game. At the end of the
game, the Ogre demands payment for services rendered. The
warband that he joined must pay his hire and upkeep fee. If the
warband cannot (or will not) pay him, he leaves, but not before
taking out his frustration on a random member of the warband (only
roll among members of the warband who were not taken out of
action during the game). Roll for injuries to this unfortunate
member just as if he had been taken out of action.

12 Swarm of Rats
Something in the sewers has frightened the rats that live there. The
rats are in a hurry to get away and will attack anything that stands in
their way. Use a template 80mm x 120mm to represent the rats. Six
monster bases (use rat swarms if you have them), placed in a
rectangle with one short side representing the front, will do nicely.
The rats move 2D6" each turn. They will always move forward
down the centre of the street and if they come to an intersection roll
randomly to determine which direction they take (example: for a
normal four-way cross-intersection roll a D6: 1-2 right, 3-4 straight
forward, 5-6 left). The rats cannot be engaged in close combat and if
they make contact with a model they will run right over him. Any
model moved over by the rats will suffer D3 Strength 2 hits, normal
armor saves apply.

13 Blast From The Past
A randomly generated character from the MVP roster arrives on the battlefield! Determine their spawn point in the usual manner, the character will ignore any rules for Stupidity they may have and will be hostile to all warbands. Ranged characters will be stationary where possible and shoot at the nearest enemy, only moving if there are no enemies within sight in which case they will move towards the closest enemy not in line of sight. Hybrid characters will walk towards the closest enemy and fire every turn too. Combat characters will run towards the closest enemy. MVP characters award +1xp point for each wound they suffer, as well as the usual +1xp for taking them out of action.

14 Aetherstorm
Reality isn't quite as consistent a thing in the wyrdstone-infected atmosphere of Mordheim. Even the stone seems to distort and flex under particular concentrations of the crystals, unwary adventurers finding themselves looking back over their shoulder to see their surroundings nothing like what it was mere moments ago as existence folds in on itself. Select two random buildings on the battlefield. In their movement phase models inside the building are immediately transported into the other building - they may not charge or shoot in that turn as they struggle to reorient themselves and ensure they don't end up warping inside a wall. The owning player may choose where in the building the models are transported to, but this may not place them in combat with enemy models. The Aetherstorm lasts for D3 turns.

15 Blood for the Blood God!
Unfortunately for the warbands involved, the scent of blood has
brought the attention of one of Khorne’s minions. Reality is
breached as a vicious Bloodletter emerges from the Realm of Chaos
to shed even more blood for its master. The Bloodletter has the
following characteristics in the Beast, Monsters & townsfolk section
Special Rule: The Bloodletter will stay for D6 turns after which it
will disappear.

16 Lucky Find
One random model, on his feet and not in hand-to-hand combat or
fleeing, has stumbled upon a shard of wyrdstone! Assuming he
doesn’t go out of action, this is added to any other shards the
warband finds after the game. If he is taken out of action in close
combat, the enemy model steals the shard away! Note that only non-
animal models can find or steal a shard, not Dire Wolves, Hunting
Dogs, etc.

21 Restless Spirit
Countless unfortunates have suffered agonising deaths in countless
forms since the comet crashed into the city. Not all of these
individuals can easily accept their new condition and they refuse to
rest. Perhaps they left some important task unfinished or seek
revenge on those who did them harm. The warbands have stumbled
upon one such ghost. Any warband member who is within 8" of the
spirit at the start of its Movement phase must make a Leadership test
or flee (exactly as if he were fleeing from combat). Models that are
immune to psychology automatically pass this test. This creature is
unable to affect (or be affected by) the physical world, but it is very
frightening nonetheless. The spirit moves 4" per turn towards the opposite edge of the board,
moving through walls, obstacles or warband members as if they
were not there. It will not charge and cannot be harmed by the
warband members in any way. The only exception to this is if the
spirit comes into contact with a Sigmarite Matriarch or a Warrior-
Priest of Sigmar. These models may choose to put the dead to rest.
If the player controlling such a model decides to do this, the spirit is
immediately banished (disappears and does not return) and the priest
gains one Experience point.

22 Burning Building
Suddenly, one of the buildings (chosen at random) bursts into
flames, ignited by smouldering embers from a fire thought
extinguished long ago. Any models inside take a S3 hit unless they
move outside in that turn and any models within 2" of the walls take
a S2 hit from the smoke and heat unless they move further away as
well. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause fear due
to the intense flames and anyone who wishes to enter it must first
pass a Fear test exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing
enemy.

23 Man-Eater
One of the trees growing in the area has been changed into a
carnivorous predator by exposure to the Chaos magic inundating the
area. Randomly determine which member of the Encountering
Player’s warband finds the plant. That model is attacked as a large
mouth opens up in the trunk of the tree and its branches whip down
to grab its unfortunate victim. Place a tree next to the victim. He is
now considered to be in close combat with the tree, which has the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Tree 0 3 0 4 6 3 3 2 10
The tree automatically passes any Leadership tests it is required to
make. Any result on the Injury table will cause the Man-Eater to
stop attacking, though it is not possible to actually take it out of
action or knock it down. Opponents are +1 to hit the tree, due to the
fact that it is rooted to the spot!

24 Skeletons
While the intense magic of the area rapidly dissolves skeletons to
dust, shambling hordes of them spring up at random from the bones
of the fallen. Uncontrolled, they roam the city wasteland, blindly
attacking everything they find before falling apart.
Use the Profile of the Skeleton in Beasts Monsters & Townsfolk
Section. 2D6 Skeletons appear.
with the following profile:
They are armed with simple weapons or bony fists (treat as daggers
in close combat). The skeletons will move towards and attack the
closest models as quickly as possible. Roll a D3 when they appear,
after that many turns they crumble back to inanimate bones (count
the current turn as the first one).

25 The Twisting of the Air
Reality itself seems to twist, warping perceptions until no one can be
sure of what their senses tell them. Roll a D6 at the start of each
player’s turn. For the next D3 game turns, the distance within which
warriors can use their Leader’s Leadership value and the distance
for being All Alone is the value rolled instead of the normal 6". All
distances between models are also increased by the same D6" roll
for purposes of weapon ranges and charging. Note that the actual
models are not moved, but only the shooting/charging model’s
perception of the distance.


26 Spawn
The warbands have stumbled upon one of the many former
inhabitants of the city that got too close to the crater at the centre of
the city and was turned into a mindless spawn. Spawn have the
following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spawn 2D6 3 0 4 4 2 3 2D6 10
Fear: Spawn are disgusting and revolting blasphemies against
nature and cause fear.
Psychology: They are mindless creatures, knowing no fear of pain
or death. Spawn automatically pass any Leadership based test they
are required to make.
Movement: The Spawn moves 2D6" towards the nearest model in
each of its Movement phases. It does not double its movement for
charging, instead if its movement takes it into contact with a model
it counts as charging and engages that model in close combat.
Attacks: Roll at the beginning of each Close Combat phase to
determine the spawn’s number of Attacks for that phase.

31 Collapsing Building
Pick one building at random. Any models inside must pass an
Initiative test or suffer a S5 hit, armor saves applying as normal, as
the building collapses. Remove the building from the table
(replacing with ruins if possible), and place the models back on the
table where it stood. Any models climbing the sides of a building or
on the roof when it collapses automatically fall from whatever
height they were at.

32 Scrawling on a Wall
A randomly determined warband member who is within 4" of a
building (if there are no models this close to a building, ignore this
encounter), sees writing suddenly appear in blood on the wall
closest to him. Roll on the following table to find out what the
writing says:
D6 Result
1 The writings are a map of the area. The model’s warband
receives a +1 on the roll to pick the scenario for the next
game they take part in.
2 Reading the writing accidentally sets off a spell on the
reader. The model suffers a minor curse and now has a -1
penalty to all dice rolls for the rest of the game.
3 The warband member learns of the remains of some booty
inside the building. If he moves inside he finds a D6 gold
crowns.
4 The writings reveal all the hiding places in the area. The
model can hide, even in the open, for rest of the game.
5 The warband member learns of a secret passage inside the
building – if he moves inside, he can pop out next turn in
any other building.
6 A fun read, but nothing else happens (Veskit was here!).

33 Energizing Winds
Like a bizarre green version of cocaine the saturation of Wyrdstone dust in the air brings a rush of energy and seemingly endless stamina to the warband members. In the encountering player's turn roll a D3, all characters' base movement for all warbands is increased by that amount for that round turn. The winds last for D3 turns.

34 Light as a Feather
Gravity has not been acting the same recently in this particular area of Mordheim. For the rest of the game all climbing tests and diving charges may be rerolled if unsuccessful, and all falling damage is taken at half strength (rounding up).

35 Dog Pack
Recent events in Mordheim have caused many of the city’s dogs to
suddenly find themselves without homes. Groups of these animalsSt
have turned feral and formed into hunting packs. The warbands have
been discovered by one such (very hungry) pack. The pack consists
of 2D3 wild dogs (use the Hunting Dog stats from the Witch Hunter
warband list). The dogs move as quickly as they can toward the
nearest models, dividing themselves as evenly as they can between
multiple targets if they are available. If members of a dog pack take
a warband member out of action, he will be eaten if not rescued. If
no friendly model comes within 6" of where the model fell by the
end of that warband’s next turn, the fallen member is considered lost
(dog food). If a dog pack fails a Rout test, they leave without taking
their ‘food’ with them, any warband members taken out of action in
the last turn of the game have not been eaten and follow the normal
rules for models taken out of action.

36 Possessed!
One randomly selected member of the Encountering Player’s
warband is suddenly possessed by a minor spirit. This spirit is far
too weak to control the model’s entire body, but is instead limited to
controlling one of his or her limbs (usually an arm). The model
takes an automatic hit at his or her own Strength during each of his
or her Close Combat phases until the possession is over and may do
nothing else. The possession lasts D3 game turns. Note that
Sigmarite Matriarchs and Warrior-Priests are immune to this
possession, as are non-living warband members. If such a warband
member is the object of the spirit’s attention, randomly determine
another warband member to suffer the effect instead.

41 Sticky Feet
One randomly determined non-mounted member of the encountering player's warband finds themselves adopting strangely adhesive properties. That warband member may now move horizontally along walls as if it was open ground for the rest of the game, as long as they do not enter water. They do not need initiative tests in order to climb down either (though climbing upwards and jumping will still do).

42-44 Storm of Chaos
Clouds rapidly gather above the city in an unnatural, sickly yellow-
green mass and warp lightning begins to dance from one cloud to
another. Thunder rocks the air, screaming out in almost intelligible
noises. The clouds themselves seem to take on the shapes of
monstrous creatures and both warbands in the conflict look at each
other with fear on their faces. Roll a D6 to see what the storm
manifestation will bring:

D6 Result
1 Warp lightning begins to strike the ground in search of a
victim. It will hit the warrior with the best armor save,
attracted to the large amount of metal. That warrior takes a
S5 hit, with no armor save possible. If multiple warriors all
have the highest armor save, randomly determine which is
struck. The warp lightning will strike for D3 turns before
moving on towards another part of the city.
2 Fish suddenly fall out of the sky to pelt the area! All
movement is halved for one turn (due to wet, flapping fish
underfoot), but there is no other effect.
3 Wyrdstone dust has mixed with the water vapour in the area
and produced the strange looking clouds from which a
tainted rain begins to fall. The rain burns flesh and eats into
stone and metal. Each warband member in the open takes a
single S2 hit (normal armor saves apply) every turn the rain
lasts until he gets under cover. The rain lasts D3 turns.
4 A magical mass of lightning forms near the ground,
illuminating the area with an eerie greenish glow. It begins
to move about the area, drawn to magical powers from
which it feeds. Place a counter as per the normal Encounter
rules to represent the mass and each turn move it 2D6"
towards the highest level spell user (the one with the most
spells – each turn roll a D6 if two or more spell users have
the highest number of spells). If there are no magic users in
the game, the mass will move towards the opposite table
edge, doing nothing but blocking line of sight as it moves. If
the model the mass is moving towards casts a spell,
immediately move the counter another D6" towards the
model. If the ball of lightning touches the target model, the
model is frozen in time and cannot do anything. While
frozen, the model cannot be attacked or harmed in any way

- the lightning mass protects its prey! After freezing a
model, the lightning will no longer move but will instead
remain near its victim to feed. The lightning will feed for D3
turns on the magical energy of its victim and then flies back
towards the warp clouds above, freeing the magic user. If
the game ends before the feeding is done, the victim is
immediately released. Victims suffer no long-term ill effects
from their exposure to the lightning.
5 A rumbling is heard from overhead, as thunder erupts from
the strange clouds. The thunderclaps become more intense
and the heavy pulses of air brings warriors to their knees as
if they had been hit by cannonballs of solid air. D6 randomly
selected models are knocked down by the air bursts. If any of
these models are in close combat, all other members of that
melee are knocked down as well.
6 Tendrils of smoke drift down from the clouds, winding
around the heads of members of each warband. Randomly
select one Hero from each warband – these warriors have
been chosen by rival storm gods as their champions. The
chosen models must move towards each other every turn
and get into close combat as quickly as possible. Once in
combat, they will automatically pass all Leadership tests and
will fight until only one remains (the combat will end when
one of the models puts his rival out of action). If a warband
does not have any Heroes left in play when the storm gods
choose their champions, a random Henchman will be chosen
from that warband instead.

45 Pit Fighter
This encounter is identical to the Ogre Mercenary encounter before,
except the Hired Sword encountered is a Pit Fighter, not an Ogre
Mercenary.

46 Plague of Flies
An enormous cloud of flies appears in the sky and swoops down on
the warbands below. All models have an extra -1 to hit penalty when
shooting or fighting in close combat as flies buzz around them and
into open orifices. The flies remain for D3 game turns and then fly
away.

51 Sinkhole
An enormous mouth suddenly opens up under the feet of one
randomly determined warband member. Make an Initiative test for
the model. If the test is failed, the model falls into the pit. If a 1 is
rolled for the test, the model is sucked underground and taken out of
action. Any other failure results in the model catching himself in the
opening, which closes around him. Treat the model as being
knocked down for the rest of the game, though he may not move at
all.

52 The Horror in the House
Randomly select one warrior lurking alone inside a building (if there
are no warband members inside a building, ignore this result and re-
roll on the Random Encounters table). Unfortunately for him, he’s
not as alone as he thought. He hears a slight ripping sound as if the
air itself is being torn apart and something manifests itself behind
him. The warrior must make a Fear test and if he fails, in his next
Movement phase he will run screaming 2D6" from the building
towards the nearest table edge and can do nothing else in that turn. If
he passes the test, the unnatural presence still forces him D6"
outside, but he suffers no other effects. At the start of his subsequent
turn, a fleeing model can try to recover from his ordeal by passing a
Leadership test, but at a -1 penalty. If he does, he stops, but cannot
do anything else that turn other than catch his breath. If he fails, he
again moves 2D6", trying in vain to erase the terrifying images from
his memory. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause
fear, and anyone who wishes to enter it must first pass a Fear test
exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing enemy.

53 Plague Victims
Disease is a common occurrence among the few survivors left in the
ruins of the city. This group of a D6 citizens has contracted a
particularly nasty plague known as Nurgle’s Rot. They move at
normal rate (4") towards the nearest warband members, seeking
their help. If they come into contact with a warband member, they
will not attack, but will instead cling to him as they beseech his aid,
hindering him greatly. A model with Plague Victims in contact with
him acts as if he had just recovered from being knocked down
(moves at half rate, may not charge or run, etc. See the Mordheim
rules for details). If one or more of the Plague Victims is charged,
shot at, or otherwise attacked, these pitiful victims will rout
immediately. At the end of the game, roll a dice for each warband
member in play when the Plague Victims appeared and on a roll of
1, that member has contracted Nurgle’s Rot. Roll again to see what
effect the disease has on that member:
D6 Result
1 Major Symptoms: The plague races through the victim’s
system, producing horrible disfiguring lesions before killing
him. If the model is a Henchman, he dies. If the model is a
Hero, roll D3 times on the Serious Injury table (ignoring
Robbed, Bitter Enmity, Captured and Sold to the Pits
results) to determine the long term effects of the disease.
2-5 Minor Symptoms: The plague takes its toll on the victim as
it takes its course. Without proper bed rest the victim will
die. The warband member must miss the next game as he
recovers.
6 Full Recovery! The victim has an especially hardy
constitution or gets an extremely mild case of the disease.
The victim suffers no ill effects.

54 Last One Standing
The horrors of Mordheim can drive even the strongest mind past the
point of madness. This Sigmarite Matriarch (for stats see the Sisters
of Sigmar section of the Mordheim rules) has seen her entire
warband cut down around her and the experience has proven too
much for. She now seeks revenge and is not particular about who
gets to pay! She is armed with a Sigmarite Hammer and steel whip
and wears heavy armor and a helm. She carries Blessed Water and
a Holy Relic on her person as well. She knows the prayers The
Hammer of Sigmar and Armor of Righteousness (see the Prayers of
Sigmar chart in the Mordheim rules for details). Roll randomly to
determine which she casts on herself each turn. She has the skills
Absolute Faith, Jump Up and Step Aside. The Matriarch will move
as quickly as possible towards the nearest model and engage them in
close combat if able. She will not rout and must be taken out of
action to make her stop. If the Matriarch is taken out of action, leave
her body where it fell, any non-animal warband member may loot
her body by moving into contact with it during their Movement
phase. If this warrior is later taken out of action as well, place a
counter where the warrior fell to represent the Matriarch’s
equipment. This can then be picked up by a different model, as
above.

55 The Wrong Trousers
Possession? Again? Fortunately the demonic power in question isn't quite as vindictive as others, rather than posessing a character's arms and attempting to kill them this demon is more of an impish sort of creature. The legs of a randomly determined warband member become posessed by this devious entity, and in each of its movement phases it will move 2D6" in a direction determined by the scatter dice instead of its normal move. This movement will ascend and descend walls without the need for a climbing test at no movement penalty, placing models inside the building on a floor closest to their end point should their movement leave them stuck on the outside of a building. This movement ignores all collision with bases, the possessed model moving through allied and enemy bases alike at no penalty, and this movement will cause the character to leave any combat it is in. The character may shoot as normal.

56 Catacombs
The ground gives way under one randomly selected warrior and he
falls into the depths of the catacombs below the city. He takes a S3
hit from the fall unless he passes an Initiative test, and lands near the
remains of others who have fallen before him. Assuming he’s not
taken out of action by the fall, he discovers one of the following
after a quick search (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1 A helmet
2 A small pouch containing 2D6 gold crowns
3 A lantern
4 A net
5 A vial of Black Lotus
6 A sword
Unless he has a rope & hook, the warrior is stuck in the catacombs
and cannot rejoin the game. He will count as being out of action for
Rout purposes, but will rejoin his warband after the game with no
other untoward effects. If he does have a rope & hook, he can climb
out D3 turns later, appearing inside a randomly determined building.

61 Forbidden Fruit
Ghostly white flowers suddenly open on a tree in the area and emit a
powerful fragrance. Randomly determine a member of the
Encountering Player’s warband who happens to be standing next to
the tree when it comes to life. Place the tree within 2" of this model.
Any warband members within 8" of the tree must make a
Leadership test at the start of each of their turns or move as quickly
as possible towards the tree. If within 1" of the tree, a spellbound
model will pick and eat one of the swollen, blood-red fruit hanging
from its branches. Any model eating one of the fruit is automatically
taken out of action, as powerful poisons incapacitate him or her. A
non-spellbound warband model may keep another model from
moving toward the tree by moving into base to base contact with
him or her and holding him back. Neither model may do anything
else while the spellbound model attempts to move to the tree and the
restraining model attempts to prevent him from doing so. Both
spellbound and restraining models can react normally if attacked in
close combat and a restraining model can give up his attempts at any
time. This encounter lasts the remainder of the game. Close
inspection of the tree reveals the bones of several animals
overgrown with grass and leaves lying at its base.

62 The Lost
Many view the destruction of Mordheim as a sign that the world is
coming to an end. Groups of these lunatics are often drawn to the
city where they attack anyone they come across, certain that they are
in some way helping to avert this cataclysm. This group of D3
Flagellants (see the Witch Hunter section of the Mordheim rules for
stats and special rules) will move as quickly as possible towards the
nearest warband members and engage them in close combat as soon
as they are able. They are armed with flails.

63 Reflecting Pool
One warrior on the ground (selected at random from the
Encountering Player’s warband) notices a small pool of what looks
to be still water. Reflecting the gloomy sky above, it appears to be
liquid metal or unnaturally deep silvery water, rippling only slightly
with the dank breeze blowing through the city. Peering into its depths, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1 The water reflects back nightmare images of his own
demise, filling him with fear for his own safety. For the rest
of the game, no matter how far away he is from friendly
models, he will always count as being all alone in close
combat.
2 The warrior glimpses an image of what is yet to come. For
the rest of the current turn he may re-roll (once!) any
shooting or close combat rolls to hit.
3 A faint image of his personal god appears, be it Sigmar or
even the dread Shadowlord. Filled with courage, the warrior
may ignore any and all Leadership-based tests he is required
to make for the rest of the game.
4 The warrior peers into the depths of his own mind,
unlocking untapped abilities. He can detect any enemy
models hidden that turn, even those not in his normal line of
sight, and passes the information on to the rest of his
compatriots. All enemy models lose their hidden status.
5 A slender arm reaches out from the pool, leaving no ripples
in the smooth liquid, and pale fingers touch the warrior’s
chest. The soft caress causes a faint glow, which spreads
throughout his body. Though it quickly dims away, a strong
feeling of strength and vitality is left behind. The warrior
may ignore the next wounding hit he receives, even if it is a
critical hit.
6 The city chooses to reveal its true visage to the warrior,
unveiling the monstrous intelligence that lurks behind the
facade of simple ruins and rubble. The warrior’s mind is
overwhelmed by the enormity of the impression and he
stumbles away in stark terror. For the rest of the game, all
enemy models count as causing fear to the warrior and he
will refuse to enter any buildings or get within 2" of any
walls or ruins. After the game the effects will wear off,
though he will always hesitate slightly before entering an
unlit room from now on...
Note: Only warriors who can gain in experience can choose to look
into the pool, all others simply lack the curiosity to bother!

64 Screaming Walls
Faces appear in the walls of one randomly determined building and
start to emit a piercing shriek. Any warband members within 8" of
the building take a S1 hit (no armor saves allowed) and are at -1 on
all to hit rolls (close combat and shooting) while the screaming lasts.
Spellcasters are even more sensitive to the noise than others and so
no spells may be cast from within this radius. Roll a D3 to determine
how many game turns the screaming lasts.

65 Wyrdstone Comet
The spell "Comet of Cassandora" from the Lore of Heavens is cast at a scattered point 4D6" from the centre of the board. Instead of doing 2D6 hits to all units as stated in the book it will do a single hit on all models instead within the specified range and at the same strength. Once the comet lands it may be mined to harvest the wyrdstone it consists of. Models may collect wyrdstone from it in the same way as usual, and the comet will hold shards of Wyrdstone equal to its strength when it landed. 

66 Itsy-Bitsy Spider
The presence of the wyrdstone has mutated this common household
pest into a monster of titanic proportions! This Gigantic Spider has
the following characteristics:
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Spider 5 3 0 5 4 4 1 2 10
Fearsome Beast: The Gigantic Spider causes fear.
Chitinous Hide: It has an armor save of 4+.
Poisonous Bite: Any to wound rolls of 5 or 6 (rather than just a 6)
are treated as critical hits.
The Gigantic Spider moves from the table edge it starts from to the
opposite table edge, attacking any warband members that get in its
path.

#### Power in the Stones

By Daniel Carlson
“Of course there’s magic in those stones... but it is dark magic, and only the desperate or the foolish would seek to
use it. Woe to us that our times are rich in both desperation and fools.” – Fabergus Reinhardt, Witch Hunter
The value of the wyrdstone shards is not simply the coin that
nobles and merchants are willing to pay for them. It is a well-
known fact that the stones are rich in magic, and they are said
to grant a variety of powers to those that learn to use them.
Tales are told among the common folk of stones that caused a
certain farmer’s harvest to double, or of the stone that made
old Herr Grutenbauer's dog speak like a man. True or not,
these tales hint at the powerful and chaotic forces at work in
the stones. The most common use for the stones’ magic has
to do with the discovery of the famed alchemist van Hoffman
of Reikland. It was he who first observed that Wyrdstone can
serve as a catalyst in the transmutation of base metals into
gold. This usage of the stones has come to be the primary
obsession of those who seek it, for many are willing to pay
princely sums for stones that will make them an even larger
fortune. Yet there are those who continue to seek the stones
for their more arcane uses, and even mercenaries have been
known to keep a stone or two that was thought to bring luck,
healing, or other magical benefits.
Yet the stones are ultimately the work of Chaos, and those
who seek to use them often learn to fear their magic rather
than harness it. For every tale of a harvest that doubled, there
are two about the harvests that rotted in the field when
exposed to the strange glow of the stones; and for every tale
of a dog that learned to speak like a man there are darker tales
of animals that turned into a gruesome parody of a man-beast.
The tales of magical healings are mixed with many of
mutation and death brought on by exposure to the stones. Yet
greed is the downfall of many in the City of the Damned, and
the greed for power is perhaps the greatest of all...
Note: Witch Hunters, Sisters of Sigmar, Bretonnians, High
Elf Shadow Warriors and Dwarfs are all too aware of the
corrupting power of the stones, and will not make use of
them under any circumstances.

##### Evaluating Stones

Instead of selling or storing all of a warband's wyrdstone
shards, a player may choose to have one or more of their
stones evaluated by an alchemist for useful magical
properties. This is done during the trading phase of the post-
battle sequence (consequently, this means if a stone is chosen
to be evaluated and yields no special power, it cannot
subsequently be sold until after the next battle). Instead of
searching for a rare item, a hero may take one shard of the
warband’s wyrdstone to an alchemist. Numerous alchemists
have flocked to Mordheim to study the stones, and they ply
their trade from tents and wagons in the encampments around
the city. Alchemists are known for their greed, however, and
they do not provide their services for free; for each stone
evaluated, the warband must pay 20 gold crowns. When the
stone is evaluated, roll 2D6 on the chart opposite:

2 Spell Stone. Any model who carries this stone into battle
may cast one randomly determined spell for the duration of
the battle, using the normal rules for spell casting. The spell
should be determined at random from the Lesser Magic spell
list, and a different spell should be generated before each
game in which the stone is used. This means the stone will
be more useful in certain battles than others, depending on
which spell it happens to provide for that game.
3 Stone of Regeneration. Any model who caries this stone
into battle will regenerate lost wounds at a rate of one
Wound regained each recovery phase. A model carrying this
stone treats all stunned results it suffers on the Injury Chart
as knocked down.
4 Stone of Might. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1 +1 Initiative 2 +1 Movement
3 +1 Strength 4 +l Toughness
5 +1 Attacks 6 +1 Wounds
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
5 Stone of Warding. A model who carries this stone will not
be affected by hostile magic spells on a D6 roll of 4+.
6-8 No beneficial powers.
9 Stone of Luck. A model who carries this stone may re-roll
any dice roll he makes once per game. The second roll must
be taken. This power may not be combined with other 'luck
enhancements' like the spell Luck of Shemtek to yield re-
rolls on top of re-rolls, though it may be used to give a
model affected by these enhancements one additional re-roll
during the battle as normal.
10 Stone of Skill. A model who carries this stone into battle
will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the
battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected
before each battle:
1-2+1 Weapon Skill 3-4+1 Ballistic Skill 5-6+1 Leadership
Note that this temporary boost may take a characteristic
above normal racial maximums.
11 Stone of Healing. A model who carries this stone may heal
one model within 2" of him (including himself) during each
recovery phase. The warrior regains one lost Wound. Note
that this healing is only beneficial to models who have more
than one Wound on their profile.
12 Stone of Protection. A model who carries this stone has
their armor save improved by one point (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+ save). Note that no model may ever have a
save better than 1+. If the model has no armor, the stone
gives him a 6+ armor save.

###### Using Stones

Stones may only be used by heroes, just like other equipment.
No hero may ever carry more than one stone at a time (the
combined Chaotic magic would instantly turn them into
Chaos Spawn). Using a wyrdstone’s power is always a
dangerous undertaking and to represent this, after every
battle, each hero who carried a stone must make a check to
see if they have been adversely affected by their usage of the
stone’s power. Make the check by rolling 2D6 for each hero:
a roll of 2, 3, 11 or 12 indicates that they have been affected.
Skaven, having a natural tolerance for warpstone, are only
affected on the roll of 2 or 12. Roll a D6 on the following
chart over the page to see what has happened to affected
models.
1 Spawn! The model has succumbed to the raw mutating
force of Chaos, and becomes a terrible Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
2 Weakened. The model has lost some of its life force to the
stone. One of the model's characteristics is permanently
reduced by one. Roll 2D6 to see which characteristic suffers:
1-2 Movement 3 Weapon Skill
4 Ballistic Skill 5-6 Strength
7-8 Toughness 9-10 Initiative
11-12 Leadership
If any characteristic is reduced to 0 as a result of the
weakening, the model becomes a Chaos Spawn. See
'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.
3-4 Sickened. Exposure to the stone's magic has made the
warrior physically ill. He must miss the next battle while he
recovers.
5-6 Mutation! The corrupting power of Chaos has caused the
model to gain a mutation. Roll on the Random Mutation
Table (see below).

###### Becoming a Chaos Spawn

Chaos Spawn are the wretched remains of one who has tasted
the power of Chaos and proved unable to withstand its
mutating touch. Wracked with waves of mutation and
change, a warrior is reduced to a monstrous beast of fangs,
tentacles, eyeballs, and other horrific growths. Their mind is
forever shattered, and they become a gibbering and mindless
servant of Chaos. Typically, when a being meets this fate, his
former comrades will put him out of his misery with a swift
death... unless that seems like too dangerous a task to
attempt, in which case they will simply herd the beast away
down one of Mordheim’s winding alleys or into the sewers.
There are, however, some who have a desire for and affinity
with Chaos Spawn that allows them to keep their mutated
friend among their ranks as a weapon and pet to use against
their enemies.
If one of your heroes becomes a Chaos Spawn he is
considered to be lost to the warband, unless your warband is
from the Cult of the Possessed or Skaven. Followers of
Chaos have a sort of semi-reverence for these mindless
beasts, and the Skaven have long been adept at training and
using the products of wyrdstone-induced mutation.
When the hero ‘Spawns’, any armor they were wearing is
lost in the storm of violent mutation that overtakes the
unfortunate warrior. Weapons and equipment are abandoned
by the creature, however, and may be reclaimed by the
warband. The new Spawn retains its previous characteristic
profile and any existing mutations, and immediately gains an
additional D6 mutations which should be generated on the

Random Mutation Table. If the hero was previously a spell
caster, all spell casting ability is lost. If the model became a
Spawn as the result of a characteristic being taken down to
zero, that characteristic becomes a 1 on the Spawn’s profile.
The Spawn's Movement characteristic may be deleted, as the
Spawn is now subject to a special rule that governs its
movement on the table top. The Spawn is now subject to the
following special rules:
Fear: The Spawn now causes fear.
Psychology: The Spawn is immune to all psychology rules.
Movement: Instead of normal movement, each movement
phase, the Spawn moves 2D6" towards any enemy model.
The Spawn must move straight towards an enemy, though
this need not be the nearest enemy, and may be an enemy the
Spawn cannot even see (Spawn have a plethora of senses,
magical and otherwise that tell them where their foes are). If
this movement brings the Spawn into contact with any model,
friend or foe, the Spawn immediately attacks it, and will
continue to fight in following rounds until the other model
has been taken out of action or fled. Spawn may move up
ladders and stairs, and may even attempt to climb walls
subject to the normal climbing rules.
The Spawn will not gain any experience points from future
battles; it is far too mindless to learn from its actions.
The Spawn should be represented by an appropriate model.
While this could be one of the Chaos Spawn models from the
Warhammer line, it's probably more satisfying and fun to
make your own. Spawn are the ultimate you-can-do-no-
wrong conversion project, where you can throw together all
sorts of stray bits to make a really unique model.

###### Random Mutation Table

Mordheim is a city under the sway of Chaos, and with Chaos
comes mutation and change. There are numerous ways by
which a warrior can be afflicted with mutation, and there are
some who actually seek out mutation as a 'reward’ of the
Chaos Powers. While mutations are not always harmful, and
indeed can often be helpful, they are a mark of Chaos, and as
such those who bear them are feared, shunned and persecuted
throughout the Empire.
The following is a table used to generate the colourful,
exotic, and sometimes debilitating mutations that will be
visited upon certain warriors at certain times (i.e. as a result
of exposure to Wyrdstone, for example). The table may also
prove useful to Game Masters who want to quickly generate
some interesting mutants for a special scenario. The table
uses a D66 roll, just like the Heroes Serious Injuries table in
the rulebook. If the mutant rolls a mutation that it already
possesses, re-roll it until a new mutation is generated.
Note: The great danger of mutation is that it will ultimately
overwhelm the victim with the corrupting power of Chaos,
reducing them to a monstrous and mindless Chaos Spawn. To
represent this danger, if a warrior ever has a characteristic
reduced to zero as the result of a mutation, they immediately
degenerate into a loathsome Chaos Spawn (see the full rules
for Chaos Spawn above).

Any member of a human, mercenary warband (this includes
both Ostlanders and Averlanders) that receives a mutation
marked with * is immediately drummed out of the warband
by his suspicious peers. Remove the hero from the roster, his
equipment is lost.

Random Mutation Table
Roll a D66
11 Acid Spray*: The mutant can spit acid at its foes. The acid spray
uses the mutant’s Ballistic Skill to hit, just as if the mutant were
firing a missile weapon. The spray has a range of 8", and a Strength
of 4. The mutant does not suffer any penalty for spraying a target at
long range, nor does the mutant suffer any penalty for moving and
spraying in the same turn.
12 Atrophy: A part of the mutant’s body has become shrivelled and
atrophied. Roll a D6:
1 Head - The mutant is now subject to stupidity.
2-4 Arm - The mutant loses the usage of one arm. The
mutant may only use a single one-handed weapon from
now on. If both arms are lost the mutant must be retired
from the warband unless it possesses a tail or bite attack
of some kind.
5-6 Leg - The mutant loses the usage of one leg. Divide the
mutant's Movement in half, rounding up. If both legs are
lost, the mutant must be retired from the warband.
13 Beaked*: The mutant has a beak like that of a bird or octopus,
though its other facial features remain unchanged. Unless the mutant
already possesses a bite attack, the mutant may make an additional
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its vicious bite.

#### 14 Beweaponed Extremities*:

The mutant’s hands are turned into
weapons! The mutant may no longer use other weapons or
equipment that would require the usage of hands.
On the plus side, it no longer has to worry about being caught
without a weapon! The mutant will gain the normal extra attack in
hand-to-hand for using an additional hand weapon, and the weapon
extremities follow the normal rules for weapons of their type (i.e.
sword extremities may be used to parry).

Roll a D6 for each arm to see what it becomes:

1-2 sword, 3-4 mace, 5-6 axe.

If the mutant grows two sword extremities, it may re-roll failed
parries just as if it had a sword and a buckler.

15 Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone
in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical
hits) from the spurting corrosive blood.
16 Brightly Patterned Skin*: The mutant's skin becomes brightly
coloured with contrasting stripes, spots, or other patterns. No effect
on play, but a great excuse to paint an interesting new model!
21 Burning Body*: The mutant's body is constantly burning with
flickering tongues of hellish flame and burns with unnatural light.
The warrior may not carry any weapons or armor unless they are
magical, or forged from Gromril or Ithilmar. The mutant does not
suffer the usual penalties for fighting with his fists (no -1 to the
mutant's Strength, enemies do not add +l to armor saves). The
mutant always counts as having a lantern. Any model in base
contact with the mutant suffers an automatic Strength 2 hit at the
beginning of each close combat phase. The flames cannot cause
critical hits.
22 Cloud of Flies: The mutant is permanently surrounded by a great
swirling mass of flies. Opponents in close combat with the mutant
are at -1 on all to hit rolls, as the flies buzz into eyes, noses, and
mouths.
23 Cloven Hooves*: The warrior gains +l Movement.
24 Crystalline Body*: The mutant's body becomes living crystal,
which is tough, but easily shattered. The mutant's Toughness
becomes 6, while its Wounds become 1.
Neither of these attributes can subsequently be altered by experience
or mutation. If an experience advance indicates a change in one of
these characteristics, re-roll the advance until a different
characteristic advance is obtained.
25 Elastic Limbs*: The mutant's arms can stretch out, allowing the
mutant to attack from a distance. If the mutant is not in base contact
with an enemy model at the beginning of the hand-to-hand combat
phase, it may make one hand-to-hand attack against a single visible
enemy within 6" of the mutant. The enemy does not get a chance to
fight back.
26 Enormously Fat: The mutant becomes enormously fat and
bloated. Divide its Movement in half, rounding up; add +1 to its
Toughness; and reduce its Initiative by 1.
31 Extra Arm*: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in
the extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or buckler in the extra
arm. If a mutant who is unable to use weaponry (i.e. Possessed,
Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain an extra
attack; they are still not permitted to use weapons.
32 Extremely Thin: The mutant becomes a matchstick figure,
sickly thin and bony. Divide its Toughness in half, rounding up.
33 Eyestalks*: The mutant has stalked eyes, similar to a crab. The
mutant now causes fear.
34 Fangs*: The mutant grows huge fangs, giving it an extra bite
attack (unless it already has one) in each hand-to-hand combat
phase. The bite attack uses the mutant's normal Strength.
35 Furry*: The mutant grows a covering of long, dense fur. The
mutation changes the mutant's appearance only; and has no effect on
its profile.
36 Great Claw*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
41 Hideous: The mutant causes fear, and is seldom invited to
parties.
42 Horns*: The mutant's head grows horns, and it gains an extra
gore attack in hand-to-hand combat at the mutant's normal Strength
The mutant may no longer wear a helmet.
43 Iron Hard Skin*: The mutant's skin is covered in iron and steel
scales. The mutant's armor save is improved by +1 (i.e. a 5+ save
becomes a 4+). Note that a warrior's armor save may never
improve to better than a 1+ save. If the mutant has no armor, their
skin alone gives them a 6+ armor save.
44 Mace Tail*: The mutant grows a flexible tail with a mace-like
bony tip. Unless it already has a tail, the mutant gains an extra tail
attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase at the mutant's Strength
+1. If the mutant already has a tail, it will have to decide at the
beginning of each hand-to-hand phase which tail it wishes to use.
45 Moronic: The mutant's mind shrinks. The mutant is now subject
to stupidity.
46 Plague Bearer*: The mutant carries a hideous, Chaos-tainted
disease. The mutant's limbs are covered in open sores, and the
mutant is dramatically weakened by its condition.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1. Any time the
mutant hits an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, there is a chance they
have infected their foe with this debilitating disease: the enemy
model must roll equal to or less than its Toughness on a D6 to avoid
contracting the sickness. If the roll is higher than the model's
Toughness, they suffer the -1 to Movement and Initiative penalty for
the rest of the battle, (after which it is assumed they get immediate
herbal remedies and plenty of rest to keep the disease from setting in
permanently!). The Plague Bearer may not infect the same model
more than once in a single battle. In addition, the Plague Bearer's
ghastly appearance means it now causes fear.
51 Poisonous Bite: The mutant grows small fangs which can secrete
a potent poison.
Unless the warrior already has a bite attack, it gains an extra attack
in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its deadly bite. The
poisonous bite is a Strength 5 attack, but is reduced to Strength 2 if
the target of the bite is immune to poison. If the mutant already
possesses a bite attack, it is simply upgraded to include the
poisonous effect described above.
52 Prehensile Tail*: The mutant grows a prehensile tail. Unless the
mutant already has a tail attack, he gains an additional attack with
this tail in each hand-to-hand combat phase. The mutant may hold
and use any singlehanded weapon in the tail, or alternatively, he
may carry and use a shield or buckler with it. If a mutant with other
tail attacks does use an equipped prehensile tail in a hand-to-hand
combat phase, he may not use any of his other tail attacks during
that phase; a single tail must be selected for use at the beginning of
each hand-to-hand phase. If a mutant unable to use weaponry (i.e.
Possessed, Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain
an extra attack (unless they already possess a tail attack); they
remain unable to use weapons.
53 Regeneration: The mutant can often heal instantly from wounds
it suffers in battle. When the mutant suffers one or more Wounds, it
may try to regenerate the damage. Roll a D6: on the roll of a 4+, the
mutant has instantly healed itself back to full Wounds. If less than a
4 is rolled, the mutant's regenerative powers have been temporarily
exhausted, and it may not attempt further regenerations for the
remainder of the battle.
54 Resilient: The mutant's skin thickens, or becomes scaly, or
otherwise increases its resilience to damage. Increase the mutant's
Toughness by +1.
55 Scorpion Tail*: The mutant has a long barbed tail with an
envenomed tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in
each hand-to-hand combat phase (unless the mutant already has a
tail attack, in which case it will have to select a single one of its
available tail attacks in each hand-to-hand phase). If the model hit
by the tail is immune to poison, the Strength of the hit is reduced to
2.
56 Skull Face*: The flesh of the mutant's face dissolves, leaving a
skull. The mutant now causes fear.
61 Spines*: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
62 Stunted: The mutant's body becomes hunchbacked and stiffened.
Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1.
63 Suckers*: The mutant's limbs are covered in adhesive suckers.
The mutant automatically passes Initiative tests when climbing.
64 Tentacle*: One of the mutant's arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
65 Warts: The mutant is covered in repellent warts. The mutant's
profile is unaffected.
66 Wings*: The mutant grows a pair of feathered or bat-like wings.
The wings are not strong enough to allow the mutant to fly in the
proper sense, but they do allow the mutant to glide down from an
elevated position. If the mutant is above the table-top surface (on a
roof, walkway, etc.) it may glide down at a rate of 2" horizontally
for each inch of downward vertical movement.

#### A Visit to the Apothecary

Each warrior may only attempt to get treatment for one injury at a time, and only one attempt at treatment per Hero may be made during each post battle sequence. The cost for treatment will vary from location to location per attempt (one attempt = one roll on the table), and this money must be paid before rolling on the table – Mordheim physicians demand payment in advance, while the patient is still capable of doing so! When you visit an Apothecary you may add +1 to find the drugs or potions that you are looking for. 

Necromancers often visit the surgeon looking for body parts and bodies for their creations and zombies. A necromancer may stop by the surgeon to find bodies for zombies and reanimate them. Roll a d6 if you roll a 6 you may add a zombie to your warband at 1/2 the cost. 

The following injuries cannot be treated: Chest Wound, Blinded in One Eye, and Old Battle Wound. They are permanent damage the afflicted warrior will carry to his grave. 
The following injuries use the Limb Surgery table: Leg
Wound, Smashed Leg, and Hand Injury.

The following injuries use the Brain Surgery table: _Madness_ and _Nervous Condition_.

####### Surgery table

2D6 Result

######## 2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The unfortunate patient has expired due to excessive blood
loss. The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the
warband record, but his equipment is retained by the
warband.

######## 4 ‘This has got to come off!’
The surgeon has felt the need to amputate, ostensibly to
‘keep the rot out’. If a leg was being treated, the model now
has its Movement halved (rounding up); if a hand was being
treated, the warrior may only use a single-handed weapon
from now on.

######## 5-6 ‘Sorry, lad!' Done my best!’
The surgery was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss the
next battle while he recovers.

######## 7-8 ‘No luck!’
The surgery was unsuccessful.

######## 9-10 ‘Mind you stay off it for a bit!’
The surgery was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.

######## 11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The surgery was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile

####### Brain Surgery table
2D6 Result

######## 2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’
The physician has been a bit too zealous in his treatment.
The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the warband
record, but his equipment is retained by the warband.

######## 4-5 ‘Erm... that’s not right!’
The treatment has not only failed to help the warrior, it has
actually worsened his condition! The warrior is now subject
to Stupidity. If the warrior was being treated for Stupidity,
there is no change in his condition (except perhaps, a bit
more drooling than usual).

######## 6 ‘A bit unhinged, that one!’
The treatment has failed, and the warrior emerges from the
treatment as something of a raving lunatic. The warrior
suffers a -1 Initiative penalty (down to a minimum of 1). He
is now so unsettling to behold that he causes fear.

######## 7-8 ‘Sorry lad! Done my best!’
The treatment was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss
the next battle while he recovers.

######## 9-10 ‘A bit of rest, and you’ll be fine!’
The treatment was successful! The warrior may remove the
injury and its adverse effects from his profile. He must,
however, miss the next battle while he recovers.

######## 11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’
The treatment was a complete success! The warrior may
remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile.
