### Campaigns

Warbands travel to the City of the Damned from all over the
Old World. They come from many races and for many
reasons but ultimately they must all face the dangers of the
dim alleys and twisting, winding streets of Mordheim.
Although it is great fun to fight individual battles, part of the
challenge of Mordheim is to build your warband into a force
to be reckoned with. A campaign gives your warband the
chance to gain experience and new skills, as well as the
opportunity to hire extra warriors as its fame and fortune
increases.

#### Starting a campaign

To start a campaign you’ll need at least two players,
preferably three or more. Players may have more than one
warband, but most people prefer to run one at a time, as this
allows them to devote more of their attention to painting,
modelling and playing with their favourite warband.
You can start a campaign as soon as two players have
recruited their warbands. New players can join the campaign
any time after that. Although the new warbands will be less
experienced they will soon learn new skills. Fighting other,
more powerful, warbands will allow them to develop more
quickly.

#### Playing a campaign game

To start the campaign, the two players select one of the
scenarios to fight (see the Scenarios section). At
the end of each game the players work out how much
experience their warriors have earned and how much
wyrdstone the warband has collected before returning to its
encampment.
Experience is expressed as Experience points which Heroes
and Henchmen groups receive for surviving each game. This
is covered later in the Experience section. When a Hero or a
group of Henchmen has sufficient Experience points they
receive an advance. An advance might improve a warrior’s
characteristics profile, adding to his WS, BS, S etc, or he
might gain a special skill such as Mighty Blow or Acrobat.
After each game the warriors collect wyrdstone. This is
recorded on the warband’s roster sheet, and can later be sold
for gold, used for trading, etc. You can recruit more warriors
or buy new weapons from traders. All this is explained in the
Income and Trading sections, later.


#### Post battle sequence

After the battle is over, both players work their way through
the following sequence. You do not have to work through it
all at once (try to do the first three parts straight after the
battle – you may wish to consider further purchases later) but

any dice rolls must be seen by both players or a neutral third
party.
1 Injuries. Determine the extent of injuries for each warrior
who is out of action at the end of the game. See the Serious
Injuries, on page 118.
2 Allocate experience. Heroes and Henchmen groups gain
experience for surviving battles. See the Experience and
Scenarios sections for details.
3 Roll on the Exploration chart. See the Income section for
details.
4 Sell Wyrdstone. This can only be done once per post battle
sequence.
5 Check available veterans. Roll to see how much
Experience worth of veterans is available for hire. You don’t
have to commit to hiring any at this point.
6 Make rarity rolls and buy rare items. Make rolls for any
rare items you intend to buy and pay for them. These items
go into the warband’s stash.
7 Look for Dramatis Personae. If you want to hire any.
8 Hire new recruits & buy common items. New recruits
come equipped with their free dagger and may be bought
common items. This is done in any order and may be done
several times. Note that newly hired recruits cannot buy rare
items. They can, however, be equipped with rare items if
there are any in the warband’s stash in stage 9.
9 Reallocate equipment. Swap equipment between models
as desired (provided they are eligible to use it).
10 Update your warband rating. You are now ready to
fight again.

#### Death of a Warrior

When a warrior is killed (Hero or Henchman) all his weapons
and equipment are lost. This is very important, so be clear
about it from the start. It is not possible to reallocate a
warrior’s weapons or equipment once he is dead.

#### Death of a Leader

If the leader of the warband is slain, the Hero with the next
highest Leadership value takes command. He then gains the
Leader ability (although he must continue to use his original
Skill list). If there is more than one Hero eligible to assume
command, the warrior with the most Experience points
becomes the leader. If that is also is even the player may choose.
In the case of Undead warbands, the death of the Vampire
means that the warband’s Necromancer must take over. If the
warband doesn’t include one, the spells that hold the restless
dead together unravel, and the warband collapses into a pile
of bones. You can buy a Vampire after the next game, at
which point the Necromancer will step down (whether he
wants to or not) and lose the Leader skill.


#### Buying new equipment between games

As explained in the Trading section, warriors may purchase
new equipment and armaments using the warband’s treasury.
Warriors can also swap equipment between themselves.
Alternatively, old equipment can be hoarded and re-used at a
later date.
Weapons and armor purchased, swapped or taken from
storage for your warband must be of an appropriate type for
the warrior, as indicated by the warband lists. Record any
changes to the warrior’s equipment on the roster sheet.

#### Serious injuries

During a game some warriors will be taken out of action and
removed from play. At that time it doesn’t matter whether the
warrior is dead, unconscious, injured or just playing dead – in
game terms he is no longer capable of fighting in the battle
which is all that matters.
When you are playing a campaign it matters a great deal what
happens to warriors who are taken out of action! They might
recover completely and be ready to fight in the next battle, or
they might have sustained injuries. Worst of all they might
die, or be so badly injured that they have to retire.
When a Henchman receives a serious injury this is treated
differently than if a Hero received one (this is to represent the
greater effect that losing a Hero would have on your
warband). Working out the extent of a Henchman’s injuries is
very simple. You will need to roll on the chart opposite to
determine what has happened to your Hero. The chart covers
a whole range of injuries and random things that might befall
your warrior. Bear in mind that only Heroes who are taken
out of action are obliged to roll on this chart.

##### Henchman with Serious Injuries

Henchmen who are out of action at the end of the battle are
removed permanently from the roster sheet on a D6 roll of 1-
2. They have either suffered severe injuries, died of their
wounds, or decided to quit the warband. On a roll of 3-6 they
can fight in the next battle as normal.

##### Heroes with Serious Injuries

After a battle some of your Heroes may be taken out of
action. You will need to determine the extent of their injuries
before the next game.
To use the Heroes’ Serious Injuries chart opposite, roll two
D6. The first dice roll represents ‘tens’ and the second
‘units’, so that a roll of 1 and 5 is 15, a roll of 3 and 6 is 36,
etc. This type of dice roll is referred to as a ‘D66 roll’.


#### Heroes’ serious injuries chart (roll D66)

11-15 DEAD
The warrior is dead and his body is abandoned in the dark
alleys of Mordheim, never to be found again. All the
weapons and equipment he carried are lost. Remove him
from the warband’s roster.
16-21 MULTIPLE INJURIES
The warrior is not dead but has suffered a lot of wounds. Roll
D6 times on this table. Re-roll any ‘Dead’, ‘Captured’ and
further ‘Multiple Injuries’ results.
22 LEG WOUND
The warrior’s leg is broken. He suffers a -1 Movement
characteristic penalty from now on.

23 ARM WOUND

Roll again: 
- 1 = Severe arm wound. The arm must be amputated. The warrior may only use a single one handed weapon from now on. 
- 2-6 = Light wound. The warrior must miss the next game. 

24 MADNESS
the warrior suffers from Paranoia. Paranoia behaves exactly like Psychology section for details). Animosity from the Forest Goblins Warband section, except that on the result of a 1 on the Animosity table the character will attack the nearest ally regardless of whether they are a Hero or Henchman, and regardless of whether they also have Animosity/Paranoia. This effect stacks with Animosity.

25 SMASHED LEG
Roll again: 1 = The warrior may not run any more but he may
still charge. 2-6 = The warrior misses the next game.
26 CHEST WOUND
The warrior has been badly wounded in the chest. He
recovers but is weakened by the injury so his Toughness is
reduced by -1.
31 BLINDED IN ONE EYE
The warrior survives but loses the sight in one eye; randomly
determine which. A character that loses an eye has his
Ballistic Skill reduced by -1. If the warrior is subsequently
blinded in his remaining good eye he must retire from the
warband.
32 OLD BATTLE WOUND
The warrior survives, but his wound will prevent him from
fighting if you roll a 1 on a D6 at the start of any battle. Roll
at the start of each battle from now on.
33 NERVOUS CONDITION
The warrior’s nervous system has been damaged. His
Initiative is permanently reduced by -1.
34 HAND INJURY
The warrior’s hand is badly injured. His Weapon Skill is
permanently reduced by -1.
35 DEEP WOUND
The warrior has suffered a serious wound and must miss the
next D3 games while he is recovering. He may do nothing at
all while recovering.
36 ROBBED
The warrior manages to escape, but all his weapons, armor
and equipment are lost.

41-55 FULL RECOVERY
The warrior has been knocked unconscious, or suffers a light
wound from which he makes a full recovery.
56 BITTER ENMITY
The warrior makes a full physical recovery, but is
psychologically scarred by his experience. From now on the
warrior hates the following (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1-3 The individual who caused the injury. If it was a Henchman,
he hates the enemy leader instead.
4 The leader of the warband that caused the injury.
5 The entire warband of the warrior responsible for the injury.
6 All warbands of that type.
61 CAPTURED
The warrior regains consciousness and finds himself held
captive by the other warband.
He may be ransomed at a price set by the captor or
exchanged for one of their warband who is being held
captive.
Captives may be sold to slavers at a price of D6x5 GC.
Undead may kill their captive and gain a new Zombie.
The Possessed may sacrifice the prisoner. The leader of the
warband will gain +1 Experience if they do so.
Captives who are exchanged or ransomed retain all their
weapons, armor and equipment; if captives are sold, killed
or turned to Zombies, their weaponry, etc, is retained by their
captors.
62-63 HARDENED
The warrior survives and becomes inured to the horrors of
Mordheim. From now on he is immune to fear.
64 HORRIBLE SCARS
The warrior causes fear from now on.
65 SOLD TO THE PITS
The warrior wakes up in the infamous fighting pits of
Cutthroat’s Haven and must fight against a Pit Fighter. See
the Hired Swords section for full rules for Pit Fighters.
Roll to see which side charges, and fight the battle as normal.
If the warrior loses, roll to see whether he is dead or injured
(i.e., a D66 roll of 11-35). If he is not dead, he is thrown out
of the fighting pits without his armor and weapons and may
re-join his warband.
If the warrior wins he gains 50 GC, +2 Experience and is free
to rejoin his warband with all his weapons and equipment.
66 SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS
The warrior survives and rejoins his warband. He gains +1
Experience.


### Experience

As warriors take part in battles, those who survive become
more experienced, and improve their battle skills. This is
represented in campaigns by Experience points.
Warriors earn Experience points when they take part in a
battle. Once a warrior has enough points he gains an advance.
This takes the form of an increased characteristic or a new
skill. Warriors who survive long enough may progress to
become great Heroes, with many skills that they have picked
up during their long and glorious fighting career.
When warriors are recruited, some of them already have
some experience. The warband lists detail how many
Experience points different warriors begin with. Record these
on your warband roster sheet by ticking the right number of
boxes. No extra advances are gained for this experience. It
simply represents the experience the warriors have
accumulated before the warband is formed.

#### Earning experience

The Experience points warriors earn depend on the scenario.
Different scenarios have different objectives and
consequently warriors can earn experience in slightly
different ways.
Extra Experience points are always added to the fighter’s
total after the game is over, though it is a good idea to keep a
record of the opponents your warrior puts out of action
during the battle, as this often affects the experience they
gain.
If you look through the scenarios you will notice that
warriors always earn +1 Experience point for surviving a
battle. They earn this even if they are injured – so long as
they live to fight again!
The Scenarios section includes details of how many
Experience points are earned for each scenario.

#### Experience advances

As warriors earn more Experience points they are entitled to
make Advance rolls. The warband roster sheet shows how
much experience a Hero or a Henchman group must
accumulate before making a further roll. When the
accumulated experience reaches a box that has thick borders,
the warrior may make an Advance roll. The roll(s) must be
taken immediately after the game in which the advance was
earned, while both players are present to witness the result.
Note that Henchmen gain experience as a group, and
consequently all the warriors in one group gain the same
advance.

#### Underdogs

If a warband is deemed to be significantly weaker than the other participating warbands it may be considered an Underdog - though this must be decided unanimously by all players. An Underdog warband will recieve a bonus +1 experience to all participating Heroes and Henchmen Groups. 

#### Advance rolls

Make Advance rolls straight after the battle so both players
can witness the result. Roll 2D6 and consult the appropriate
tables below.
##### Heroes

2D6 Result
2 - 5 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill. See the
Magic section.
6 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Strength; 4-6
= +1 Attack.
7 Characteristic Increase. Choose either +1 WS or +1 BS.
8 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Initiative; 4-6
= +1 Leadership.
9 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Wound; 4-6
= +1 Toughness.
10 - 12 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill.

##### Henchmen

All warriors in the group gain the
same advance.
2D6 Result
2 - 4 Advance +1 Initiative.
5 Advance +1 Strength.
6 - 7 Advance Choose either +1 BS or +1WS.
8 Advance +1 Attack.
9 Advance +1 Leadership.
10 - 12 The lad’s got talent. One model in the group becomes a
Hero. If you already have the maximum number of
Heroes, roll again. The new Hero remains the same
Henchman type (e.g., a Ghoul stays as a Ghoul) and starts
with the same experience the Henchman had, with all his
characteristic increases intact. You may choose two skill
lists available to Heroes in your warband. These are the
skill types your new Hero can choose from when he gains
new skills. He can immediately make one roll on the
Heroes Advance table. The remaining members of the
Henchmen group, if any, roll again for the advance that
they have earned.
#### New skills

There are several types of skill and each has a separate list.
You may not choose the same skill twice for the same
warrior. The skills a Hero may have are restricted by the
warband he belongs to and what type of Hero he is.
To select a new skill for a Hero, pick the type of skill you
want from those available, then choose which skill has been
learned.


### Income

At the end of each battle, a warband may roll on the
Exploration chart. This is done as soon as a game is over so
that players can witness each other’s dice rolls. As you can
see from the chart, a warband that is just starting out has little
chance of finding the more obscure places in Mordheim.
However, a warband will make more discoveries as it goes
along thanks to its better equipment and accumulated skills.
Roll a D6 for each Hero in your warband who survives
without going out of action. This represents the warband’s
efforts to unearth wyrdstone. Do not roll for any Heroes who
went out of action during the battle; they are taken back to
the warband’s encampment to recuperate instead. So, for
example, if your warband includes four Heroes who all
survived the last battle, you can roll four dice. If you won
your last game, you may roll one extra dice. Add the results
of the dice together and consult the Exploration chart to see
how many shards of wyrdstone your warband has found.
Do not roll for Henchmen. This does not mean that they don’t
search the ruins, but instead represents the efforts of the
Heroes in coordinating the search parties. In addition, some
Henchmen like Zombies or Warhounds (for obvious reasons)
are not particularly useful when it comes to looking for
wyrdstone.

#### Rolling multiples

As well as finding shards of wyrdstone, the warband can
come across unusual places or encounter inhabitants of the
ruined city. If you roll two or more of the same number while
searching, you have found an unusual building or
encountered something out of ordinary. Consult the chart and
refer to the appropriate entry in the Exploration results.
For example, you might roll two 3’s or three 5’s, in which
case you should refer to the chart. Choose the most numerous
multiples if you score more than one set of multiples. So, if

you rolled a double 3 and a triple 5, only look up the triple 5
on the Exploration chart. In the case of two doubles or triples
look up the highest result. For example, if you rolled double
1 and double 3, look up the double 3 result.
Any money or loot you find in these locations is added
straight to the warband’s treasury. Any shards of wyrdstone
you find can be sold as normal.
#### Exploration procedure

1. Roll 1D6 for each of your Heroes who survived the battle and
one extra dice if you won, plus any extra dice allowed by skills
or equipment. Note, however, that you must pick a maximum of
six dice out of all the dice you roll, even if you are allowed to
roll seven dice or more.
2. Some things, such as skills and equipment, (like the
Mordheim Map) may allow you to re-roll dice. If your warband
includes an Elf Ranger, you may modify one dice by +1 or -1.
3. If you rolled any doubles, triples, etc, you have found an
unusual location in Mordheim. Consult the Exploration chart on
the next page to see what you find. Refer to the appropriate entry
on the following pages and follow the instructions given there.
4. Add the results together and consult the chart on the next page
to see how many shards of wyrdstone you have found. Mark
down the amount of wyrdstone on your warband’s roster sheet.
    NUMBER OF WYRDSTONE SHARDS FOUND

##### Doubles

(11) Well
The public wells, of which there were several in Mordheim,
were covered by rooves raised up on pillars and adorned
with carvings and fountains. The city was proud of its water
system. Unfortunately, like all the other wells, this one is in a
parlous state and undoubtedly polluted with wyrdstone.
Choose one of your Heroes and roll a D6. If the result is
equal to or lower than his Toughness, he finds one shard of
wyrdstone at the bottom of the well. If he fails, the Hero
swallows tainted water and must miss the next game through
sickness.

(22) Shop
The Merchants Guild shop has been thoroughly ransacked.
Even so, there are still items scattered around the single,
long room, mingled in with the rubble. Some are useful, such
as cast iron pots and pans and rolls of fine cloth. All manner
of smaller items are lying about – the sort of frippery which
no longer has a use in a devastated city with few inhabitants.
After a thorough search you find loot worth D6 GC.
If you roll a 1 you will also find a Lucky Charm (see the
Equipment section, page 53).

(33) Corpse
You find a still-warm corpse. A chipped dagger sticks out of
his back. Surprisingly, his possessions have not been looted.
To see what you find when you search the corpse, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1-2 D6 GC
3 Dagger
4 Axe
5 Sword
6 Suit of light armor

(44) Straggler
Your warband encounters one of the survivors of Mordheim,
who has lost his sanity along with all his worldly possessions.
Skaven warbands can sell the straggler to agents of Clan
Eshin (who will use the man for food or slavery) and gain
2D6 GC.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the unfortunate individual
for the glory of the Chaos gods. The leader of the warband
will gain +1 Experience.
Undead warbands can kill the man and gain a Zombie for no
cost.
Any other warband can interrogate the man and gain insight
into the city. Next time you roll on the Exploration chart, roll
one dice more than is usually allowed, and discard any one
dice. (For example, if you have three Heroes, roll four dice
and pick any three).
 
(55) Overturned Cart
Stuck in a ruined gateway is an overturned wagon – the
covered type that nobles travel in from the city to their estates
in the country. Since anyone important fled a long time ago,
what is it doing here? The horses have broken their traces, or
did someone cut them free?
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Mordheim Map (see Miscellaneous Equipment)
3-4 A purse with 2D6 GC
5-6 Jewelled sword and dagger. These can be kept or sold
at twice the value of a normal sword and dagger, but
note that the normal selling price is half the actual cost
(see the Trading section for rules on selling items), so
the jewelled sword will sell for 10 GC, for instance.
 
(66) Ruined Hovels
The street consists of ruined hovels, which are leaning over
at alarming angles. Not much worth looting here.
You find loot worth D6 GC amidst the ruins.


##### Triples

(111) Tavern
The ruin of a tavern is recognisable by its sign still hanging
on the wall. The upper part of the building is ruined, but the
cellars are cut into rock and are still full of barrels. There
are broken flagons and tankards everywhere.
You could easily sell the barrels for a good price.
Unfortunately your men are also interested in the contents!
The warband’s leader must take a Leadership test. If he
passes, the warband gains 4D6 GC worth of wines and ales
which can be sold immediately.
If he fails, the men drink most of the alcohol despite their
leader’s threats and curses. You have D6 GC worth of
alcohol left when the warband reaches their encampment.
Undead, Witch Hunter and Sisters of Sigmar warbands
automatically pass this test, as they are not tempted by such
worldly things as alcohol.

(222) Smithy
The furnace and toppled anvil make it obvious what work
was done here. Most of the iron and the tools have been
looted long ago. Coal and slag litter the floor but there may
still be weapons to be found among the debris.
Roll a D6 to determine what you find inside:
D6 Result
1 Sword
2 Double-handed weapon
3 Flail
4 D3 Halberds
5 Lance
6 2D6 GC worth of metal (add the value to your
treasury).

(333) Prisoners
A muffled sound comes from one of the buildings. Inside you
find a group of finely dressed people who have been locked in
a cellar. Perhaps they are prisoners taken by cultists, ready
to be sacrificed during Geheimnisnacht.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the victims (undoubtedly
finishing the job of the captors). They gain D3 Experience
which is distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
Undead warbands can callously kill the prisoners and gain D3
Zombies at no cost.
Skaven can sell the prisoners into slavery for 3D6 GC.
Other warbands can escort the prisoners out of the city. For
their trouble, they are rewarded with 2D6 GC. In addition,
one of the prisoners decides he wishes to join the warband. If
you can afford to equip the new recruit with weapons and
armor, you may add a new Henchman to any of your human
Henchman groups (with the same stats as the rest of the
group, even if they have already accumulated experience).

(444) Fletcher
This hovel was once the workshop of a fletcher – a maker of
bows and arrows. There are bundles of yew staves and
willow rods everywhere.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Short bows
3 D3 Bows
4 D3 Long bows
5 Quiver of hunting arrows
6 D3 Crossbows
 
(555) Market Hall
The market hall was raised up on pillars, with the timbered
corn exchange above the open market place. The upper
storey has been badly damaged, but the covered market still
offers a good deal of shelter. The remains of the last market
day are still lying around on the cobbles. Most of this is
broken pottery and iron pots.
You find several items worth 2D6 GC in total.
 
(666) Returning a Favour
As you are returning to your encampment, you meet one of
your old acquaintances. He has come to repay an old favour
or debt.
You gain the services of a single character from your Warhammer book worth up to 75pts. They may not use any magic items. They will join your warband for the next game only before leaving. They will not contribute to your exploration dice, but do not require upkeep either - they are completely free.


##### Four of a kind

(1111) Gunsmith
You find the workshop of a Dwarf gunsmith. Its doors have
been broken down and the rooms raided, but some of the iron
strongboxes have survived intact.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1 Blunderbuss
2 Brace of pistols
3 Brace of duelling pistols
4 D3 Handguns
5 D3 Flasks of superior blackpowder
6 Hochland long rifle

(2222) Shrine
Your warband stumbles across a ruined shrine, which is so
badly damaged that it is difficult to tell which god was once
worshipped within its walls. A few images remain on the
painted plaster walls but they have been defaced by heretics.
Fragments of smashed statues lie among the ruins. Some
items appear to be covered in gold leaf, most of which has
been torn off.
Your warband may strip the shrine and gain 3D6 GC worth
of loot.
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunter warbands may save some
of the shrine’s holy relics. They will gain 3D6 GC from their
patrons, and a blessing from the gods. One of their weapons
(chosen by the player) will now be blessed and will always
wound any Undead or Possessed model on a to wound roll of
2+.

(3333) Townhouse
This three-storey house was once part of a tenement block
overlooking a narrow alleyway. The street is now in ruins,
but this house remains largely intact. Exploring it you find
that the garret leans over so far that you can step out of the
window into the attic of the house opposite.
Your warband finds 3D6 GC worth of loot.

(4444) Armorer
A breastplate hanging from a pole drew your attention to this
place, obviously too high up to be easily looted. The
workshop is ruined and the forge has been smashed. Rooting
about in the soot, you find various half-finished items of
armor.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Shields or bucklers (choose which)
3 D3 Helmets
4 D3 Suits of light armor
5 D3 Suits of heavy armor
6 Suit of Ithilmar armor
 
(5555) Graveyard
You find an old graveyard, crammed with sepulchres that are
overgrown with ivy. The monuments to the dead are
grotesque and decorated with sculpted gargoyles. The
ironwork has been ripped from some of the tombs, and stones
have toppled off. It looks as if some of the crypts have
already been broken into by tomb robbers.
Any warband apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar
may loot the crypts and graves and gains D6x10 GC worth of
loot.
If you loot the graveyard, the next time you play against
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunters, the entire enemy
warband will hate all the models in your warband. Make a
note of this on your warband roster sheet.
Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar may seal the graves.
They will be rewarded for their piety by D6 Experience
points distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
 
(6666) Catacombs
You find an entrance to the catacombs and tunnels below
Mordheim.
You can use the new tunnels you found in the next battle you
play. Position up to three fighters (not Rat Ogres or the
Possessed) anywhere on the battlefield at ground level. They
are set up at the end of the player’s first turn and cannot be
placed within 8" of any enemy models.
This represents the warriors making their way through the
tunnels, infiltrating enemy lines and emerging suddenly from
below ground.


##### Five of a kind

(11111) Moneylender’s House
A grand mansion, that is strongly built from stone, has
survived the cataclysm remarkably well. A carved coat of
arms adorns the lintel above the doorway although it has
been defaced by raiders and the symbols are now
unrecognisable. The door itself, has been smashed open with
axes and hangs open on its hinges.
Inside, hidden amongst the debris, you find D6x10 GC to add
to your treasury.

(22222) Alchemist’s Laboratory
A narrow stairway leads down into a crypt-like dwelling
which was once an alchemist’s workshop. The sign still
hangs from one hinge above the entrance. It looks as if this
was a very old building which has remained in use for
centuries although it did not survive the comet’s destruction
too well. The stone floor has strange symbols on it and there
are charts and astrological symbols painted onto the walls.
In the ruins you find loot worth 3D6 GC and a battered old
notebook. One of your Heroes may study the Alchemist’s
notebook, and the extra wisdom he gains will enable him to
choose from Academic skills whenever he gains a new skill
in addition to those skills normally available to him.

(33333) Jewelsmith
The houses in the jewellers’ quarter have all been well and
truly looted long ago. Even the rubble has been picked over
many times for fragments of gold and gems. But still, some
small but valuable items may have been overlooked.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Quartz stones worth D6x5 GC
3-4 Amethyst worth 20 GC
5 Necklace worth 50 GC
6 A ruby worth D6x15 GC
If your warband does not sell the gems, one of your Heroes
may keep them and displays them proudly. He will gain +1 to
the rolls for locating rare items as merchants flock to such an
obviously wealthy warrior.

(44444) Merchant’s House
The merchant’s house stands by the waterfront. It has a
vaulted stone undercroft which is still stacked with barrels
and bales of cloth. The foodstuffs have been looted or eaten
long ago and huge rats infest the rotting bales. Up the stairs
are the dwelling quarters, solidly built of timber, although
badly damaged you think you can still get up to them but
you’ll need to tread with care!
Inside you find several valuable objects which can be sold for
2D6x5 GC. If you roll a double, instead of finding money
you find the symbol of the Order of Freetraders. A Hero in
possession of this gains the Haggle skill.
 
(55555) Shattered Building
The comet destroyed this building almost completely, making
it unsafe for all but the most daring to explore. But places
such as this are the best for searching for wyrdstone shards.
You find D3 shards of wyrdstone amongst the ruins. In
addition take a Leadership test against the warband leader’s
Leadership value. If passed a war dog that was guarding the
building joins the warband.
 
(66666) Entrance to the Catacombs
You find a well-hidden entrance to the dark catacombs which
extend for miles beneath the city of Mordheim. Although the
entrance looks foreboding the tunnels will take hours off your
searches of the city.
You can use these tunnels to explore Mordheim more
efficiently. From now on, you may re-roll one dice when you
roll on the Exploration chart. Make a note of this in your
warband’s roster sheet. Second and subsequent catacomb
entrances you find do not grant you any additional re-rolls,
although you may find further re-rolls from other sources.


##### Six of a kind

(111111) The Pit
You have come within sight of the Pit, the huge crater created
by the comet. A black cloud still rises from it but you can see
glowing wyrdstone everywhere. This is the domain of the
Shadow Lord, the lord of the Possessed, and no-one is
welcome here – even his own followers!
If you wish, you can send one of your Heroes to search for
any wyrdstone hidden here. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the Hero
is devoured by the guardians of the Pit and never seen again.
On a roll of 2 or more he returns with D6+1 shards of
wyrdstone.

(222222) Hidden Treasure
In the depths of Mordheim, you come across a hidden chest,
bearing the coat-of-arms of one of the noble families of the
town.
When you open the chest you find the following items. Roll
for every item on the list separately (apart from the gold
crowns) to see whether you have found it. For example, on a
roll of a 4+ you find the wyrdstone.
Items D6 Result Needed
D3 Pieces of wyrdstone 4+
5D6x5 GC Auto
Holy relic 5+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D3 Gems worth 10 GC each 4+
Elven cloak 5+
Holy tome 5+
Magical artefact 5+

(333333) Dwarf Smithy
You find a solidly built stone workshop. A runic inscription
indicates that this may have been a Dwarf smithy.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result
1 D3 Double-handed axes
2 D3 Suits of heavy armor
3 Gromril axe
4 Gromril hammer
5 Double-handed gromril axe
6 Gromril armor

(444444) Slaughtered Warband
You find the remains of an entire warband. Broken bodies lay
scattered among the ruins, torn apart by some monstrous
creature. You see a huge shape, which looks like an immense
Possessed creature, shambling away.
After giving the dead their final rites (Sisters of Sigmar or
Witch Hunters), eating them (Skaven or Undead) or looting
them (anyone else!) you find the following items. Roll for
every item separately (apart from the gold coins and daggers)
to see if you find it. For example, on a roll of 4+ you will find
the suits of light armor.
Item D6 Result Needed
3D6x5 GC Auto
D3 Suits of light armor 4+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D6 Daggers Auto
Mordheim Map 4+
D3 Halberds 5+
D3 Swords 3+
D3 Shields 2+
D3 Bows 4+
D3 Helmets 2+
 
(555555) Fighting Arena
During better times, Mordheim was famous for its duellists
and pit fighters. You have found one of the areas used to
train these warriors. The place is filled with training
equipment and practice weapons.
You find a training manual, which you can either sell for 100
GC or let one of your Heroes read. The extra knowledge your
Hero gleans from reading the manual entitles him to choose
from Combat skills whenever he gains a new skill, and his
WS may now be increased by an extra point above his normal
racial maximum (for example, a Human who has the book
would now have a maximum Weapon Skill of 7).
 
(666666) Noble’s Villa
You find a fine house which is partially ruined. It has been
thoroughly ransacked and all the furniture has been stripped
of its fine fabrics. Shards of broken pottery of the finest
quality are scattered over the floor.
Roll a D6. If you roll 1-2, you find D6x10 GC worth of items
and money to add to your treasury. On a roll of 3-4, you find
D6 vials of Crimson Shade. On a roll of 5-6 you find a
hidden magical artefact carefully concealed in a hidden cellar
or behind a secret door. Roll on the Magical Artefacts table.


#### Magical artefacts table

Roll a D6 and use this table to determine which item you find when a result in the Exploration chart indicates that you have
found a magical artefact. In a campaign none of these items can appear more than once, so if you find a magic item which
is already in someone else’s possession roll again – even if the warrior carrying it has been killed.

1 The Boots and Rope of Pieter
Pieter, the master thief of the Guild of Shadows, was the most
famous of all the cat burglars of Mordheim. He earned the
nickname ‘Spider’ for his daring robberies. The secret of his
success was a pair of enchanted boots and a magical rope
which he had acquired from far-off Araby.
A model wearing these boots may move normally (including
running, charging, etc) on any kind of terrain, including
vertical surfaces. When moving the model, simply adds the
distances moved horizontally to that moved vertically, with
no Initiative test needed (except to jump across gaps).

2 The Count of Ventimiglia’s Misericordia
This dagger was used by the notorious Tilean gentleman-
pirate known as the ‘Black Corsair’. It is claimed that he
found it in ancient Elven ruins and legend also has it that the
dagger’s blade cannot be damaged in any way.
The dagger is treated as a sword. Opponents wounded by it
are Stunned on a result of 1-3 (Undead are Knocked Down as
normal) and put Out Of Action on a 4-6.

3 Att’la’s World-Treading Mail
This armor was given as a present by the Dwarf Lord
Kurgan to the warlord Att’la in the time of Sigmar
Heldenhammer.
Att’la’s World-Treading Mail is a suit of Light Armour with the
following three runes inscribed on it:
Rune of Spell Eating: The Hero wearing this
armor is immune to all spells.
Rune of Passage: The Hero can move through solid
objects, like walls (this does not mean that he can
see through them).
Rune of Fortitude: The Hero has an extra wound.


4 Bow of Wasting
This bow was a gift to Count Steinhardt from the Elf lords of
the Forest of Shadows, its blighted quiver said to contain the
secrets of Morr himself.
The Bow of Wasting can be equipped by any character capable of learning Shooting Skills, has a range of 24" and a Strength of 4. If a model is successfully wounded by the Bow of Wasting then it will lose one point of Toughness in each of its recovery phases for the remainder of the game. 
 
5 Executioner’s Hood
Recovered from a shipwrecked Dark Elf vessel, this hood
carries evil glowing runes which fill the wearer with
unreasoning unfathomable bloodthirst.
A warrior wearing this becomes subject to and always will be
frenzied even if he is knocked down or stunned and adds +1 to their strength. 
The wearer never leaves combat under any
circumstances, and will always attack opponents in base
contact until they are taken out of action. If the wearer is
in contact with multiple enemies they may direct attacks at 
_incapacitated_ enemies even if there are also standing foes present.
If there are any stunned or knocked down models within the
wearer’s charge range at the beginning of his turn, he will
charge and attack the closest one, even if they are members
of his own warband! Fight the hand-to-hand combat until one
of the warriors is taken out of action.
 
6 All-Seeing Eye of Numas
This jewel was recovered from the ruins of Numas far in the
south. It gives its wielder horrific nightmares that predict his
future, but an absolute clairvoyance too.
The bearer of the All-Seeing Eye can see all models on the
table top, even if they are hidden or out of sight. He can guide
his fellow warband members through the ruins (this allows
you to roll two dice for the bearer after battle when rolling on
the Exploration chart). The bearer may also roll a D6 whenever they
are hit by an attack. On a 6 the hit is discarded.
All animals (such as War dogs, horses, etc) will be affected
by frenzy when fighting against the bearer of the All-Seeing
Eye.


#### Selling wyrdstone

Wyrdstone is tremendously valuable and is in constant
demand by Imperial nobles. This means that finding buyers
for your warband’s wyrdstone is not difficult. You do not
have to sell all your wyrdstone immediately after the battle –
you may want to hoard it and sell it later, as selling
wyrdstone in smaller quantities will increase demand and
raise the price. Unfortunately, the demands of running a
warband often mean that you will have to sell most of your
wyrdstone as soon as you find it.
The warband must spend a large portion of its income on
basic necessities such as food, drink, repair of weapons, and
new arrows and ammunition, as well as celebrating! A
warband leader is also expected to share any profits made by
selling wyrdstone between his men which means that the
more money the warband makes from such sales, the bigger
the share for the men.
The more models there are in the warband, the more it costs
to maintain and the higher the level of any profits made that
must be shared between the men. The number indicated on
the following chart is the profit in gold crowns earned after
deducting the warband’s maintenance costs. The profit is
added to warband’s treasury.

#### Sisters of Sigmar and income

Worldly possessions mean little to the Sisters, but their holy
mission to purify Mordheim of the influence of Chaos
requires supplies and weaponry, and these are much in
demand. Thus the warbands of the Sisterhood compete with
each other to gain the best weapons and equipment from the
temple’s armory.
To measure their success, the more wyrdstone the Sisters
bring to be kept under lock and key in the Vault of
Vindication in the temple at Sigmar’s Rock, the more aid
they will receive from the temple.
Thus all gold crowns in the possession of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband represent the resources that the High Matriarch will
put at their disposal. It does not represent money in a literal
sense, so you may like to think of it as faith, piety,
dedication, etc.
#### Skaven and Undead

Neither of these warbands puts much value on gold, but they
send all the wyrdstone they find to their superiors and receive
aid and resources in return. Skaven use their own currency
for trading, while the Undead are somewhat beyond petty
concepts of wealth. For Skaven, the gold crowns in the
warband’s treasury represent the warp tokens which the
Skaven use for currency, while for the Undead it represents
the favour they enjoy in the eyes of their master, Vlad von
Carstein of Sylvania.

#### Spending income

You can spend any accumulated money on weapons, armor,
hiring new warriors, buying new equipment or simply save
the money for a bigger purchase. See the Trading section for
details.


### Trading

Every Settlement around the city of Mordheim has at least
one trading post, shop or merchant’s guildhouse where the
local traders sell their wares and buy wyrdstone and other
items that have been scavenged from the ruins. In a large
village such a place might cover a substantial area with many
traders and merchants offering their goods and services.
Small settlements are served by travelling traders.
All warbands are able to get new equipment one way or
another. The most unscrupulous merchants actively trade
with the Possessed Cultists, and creatures such as the Skaven
have their own network of contacts, while Vampires can send
the Dregs that serve them into the less salubrious settlements
around Mordheim, such as Cutthroats’ Haven.

#### Spending cash

After every game, a warband can collect income from
exploration, etc, and sell any wyrdstone and treasures they
have acquired. Cash can be spent on recruiting new warriors,
or on new equipment for the warband.
The price of wyrdstone varies according to current demand.
See the Income section for details.

#### New recruits

New warriors are recruited in the same way as the original
warband with the notable exception of equipment. After the
start of a campaign, a new hireling can only buy Common
items from his warband’s equipment chart freely. He may
only be given Rare items from his warband’s equipment chart
if the warband can obtain them via the normal trading rules.
Warbands may recruit whatever type of warriors the player
wishes, but the usual restrictions apply regarding the number
of Heroes, Henchmen, wizards, etc. For example, no warband
may recruit a second leader, and no Mercenary warband can
have more than two Champions.


#### New recruits and existing henchmen

#### Groups

You may add new recruits to existing Henchman groups. If
the group is relatively inexperienced, you will have no
difficulty in finding raw recruits to add to their numbers. But
more experienced gnarled veterans are not so keen on letting
novice warriors join them – and quite rightly so! Between
each battle, roll 2D6: this represents the experience of the
warriors currently available for hire. You can hire as many
warriors as you wish, as long as their combined Experience
does not exceed your dice roll. For example, if you rolled 7,
you could add a single warrior to a Henchman group with 7
Experience points, or two warriors to a Henchman group with
3 Experience points, or any combination thereof. Disregard
any excess Experience points.
As with other new Henchmen, you must pay for all their
weapons and armor, and in addition you must add 2 gold
crowns to their cost for each extra Experience point they add
to the warband’s total. New Henchmen must be armed and
equipped in the same way as existing members of the group.

#### Weapons

If a player wants to buy new weapons or other equipment for
existing warriors, refer to the Price chart that follows. The
chart lists all the equipment available in Mordheim, not just
the common weapons included in the Recruitment charts.
Rare items and weapons are not always available and vary in
price. Remember that your warriors lack the skill to use any
weapons other than the ones listed in the Recruitment charts.
You may still want to buy rare items offered to you, as your
warriors may be able to use them as they gain in experience.
Players should preferably complete any recruiting and trading
after the battle is over, making the appropriate dice rolls
whilst both players are present.
However, some players may prefer to wait until the heat of
battle has cooled and they are able to consider purchases
more carefully. Determine which rare items are offered for
sale while both players are together. The players can work
out what they will buy later.
#### Trading

Trade items are divided into two sections: common and rare
items. Common items can be bought quite readily in any of
the numerous trading posts and settlements around
Mordheim. Players may purchase as many of these items as
they want. The price of common items is fixed, so players
always pay the same rate for them.
Rare items are hard or even impossible to come by. Only
occasionally do such items turn up for sale and the price
asked is often way above the true value. These items are
often offered only to the most famous warbands, or those
with the most money.
#### Availability

The Price chart has a column marked ‘Availability’. Common
items are always available, and can be bought in any
quantity. Items marked ‘rare’ are more difficult to find. A
rare item’s availability is indicated by a number, for example
‘Rare 9’.
Whenever a Hero wants to buy a rare item, roll 2D6 and
compare the result to the number stated. If the roll is equal or
greater, the item is available. For example, you need to roll 9
or more to acquire an item marked ‘Rare 9’. You can only
buy one rare item for each successful roll. You may also only
make one roll for each Hero looking for rare items. For
example, if your warband has four Heroes, you may make
four rolls to locate rare items. Warriors taken out of action
during the last battle may not look for rare items.


#### Selling

A player may trade in weapons and equipment at the same
time he buys new ones. After all, as warbands become more
powerful they often abandon their earlier armament in favour
of something better. However, the second-hand value of
equipment is not high due to the considerable wear and tear
inflicted on it by your warriors.
Warriors can automatically sell equipment for half its listed
price. In the case of rare equipment and weapons which have
a variable price, the warband receives half of the basic cost
only (merchants are far better at haggling than your warriors).
Alternatively, weapons, armor and equipment may be
hoarded for future use (make a note on the warband roster) or
swapped around the warband from one fighter to another
(though not between warbands). As a weapon’s value is low
compared to the cost of equipping any new recruits you may
get, a warband can usually find a use for its cast-off
armaments.
