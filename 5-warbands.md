### Starting a Warband

Before you begin to play you must recruit a warband to take part in the battle for Mordheim. The warbands are represented by a whole range of Citadel models available as boxed sets and blister packs. The boxed sets are designed to form an ideal starting point for your collection and further models can be added as your warband grows and thrives.

In this section of the book we take a detailed look at each of the warbands and provide the information you need to recruit a warband of that type.

Use the lists that follow to recruit and equip your warband
(an example warband has been included at the back of the
book.) You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model and
their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount
of money. As you make your choices, subtract the money you
have “spent” from your total until you have bought all you
can. Any unspent gold crowns are put into the warband’s
treasury and can be used later or hoarded to buy something
more expensive.
To start with you must recruit at least three warriors
including a leader. The weapons, armor and mutations you
choose for your warriors must be represented on the models
themselves. The exceptions are knives and daggers, which
you may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing
if not represented on the model.

#### Skill tables and starting experience

The warband lists also include information about the starting
experience of the warriors and which skills they can choose
as they progress in the game. Some warbands also include
separate skill lists unique to the warband.
The rules about experience and skills will be fully explained
in the Campaign section, so don’t worry about them for now.

#### Heroes and henchmen

For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.

#### Heroes

These are exceptional individuals who have the potential to
become legends. Heroes can be armed and equipped
individually and may carry any special equipment they might
pick up during the campaign.

#### Leader

Every warband must have a leader. He represents you, the
player. He makes the decisions and leads your warriors
through the dark streets of Mordheim.

#### Other heroes

Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to five
other Heroes, who form the core of your warband. A warband
may never include more Heroes of any specific type than the
number given in the Warband list. This means that some
warbands can only get the maximum of six Heroes by
gaining experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).

#### Henchmen

Henchmen typically fall into two groups. There are
Henchmen such as the Brethren of the Possessed, Skaven
Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen. These Henchmen
gain experience and become better as time goes by. They are
bought in groups of one to five models.

The other type of Henchmen are those such as War hounds
and Zombies. These are too dim or too primitive to gain
experience.
Henchmen may never use any special equipment you acquire
during their adventures (unless otherwise noted); only Heroes
may do so. Henchmen can include potentially powerful
warriors, but Heroes always have an edge over them with
their potential to gain extra experience.
All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group, which usually
consists of between one and five individuals. Henchmen
groups gain experience collectively and gain advances
together.
#### Weapons and armor

Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two close
combat weapons (or one two-handed weapon), a single missile
weapon, and any armor chosen from the
appropriate list. For these purposes, a brace of pistols counts
as a single missile weapon. Warriors may be restricted in
regard to which types of weapons they can use. The
warband’s equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is
available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and armor
when starting a warband, as indicated by the list in the
warband’s entry, but after playing the first game the only way
to get further rare weapons and armor is to roll to see if you
can locate them (see the Trading section).
You may buy additional equipment between battles, but your
warriors can only use the weapons and armor listed in their
warband entry. As they accumulate experience and gain
skills, Heroes may learn to use weapons other than those
initially available to them.
Every model in each Henchman group must be armed and
armored in the same way. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.
#### Warband roster

You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of
your warband. Blank roster sheets can be found printed at the
back of this book, one for Heroes and one for Henchman
groups. We suggest that you photocopy or copy as many
sheets as you need, so that you can keep a neat and accurate
record of your warband as it changes from game to game.
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and
write down the details of each Hero and Henchman group in
the appropriate places. You’ll notice that Heroes and
Henchmen have slightly different spaces provided to reflect
the different ways in which they gain experience and use
weapons, armor and equipment.
It is a good idea to work out the warband on a piece of scrap
paper first, as you will have to juggle the weapons and
fighters to get as close to the maximum permitted value of the
warband as possible. If you have any cash left after choosing
your warband write this down in the space marked as
‘Treasury’. 

The warband roster is a record of your 'brave' group of
warriors and is useful to keep beside you as you play. During
a battle you may wish to make notes on the sheet itself, to
record details such as extra experience, equipment used, etc.
You will need to give your warband a name, and also name
all your Heroes and each Henchman group. It’s up to you to
invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of
inspiration throughout this book.


#### Ready for battle

The warband is now ready to start its fighting career!


### Warbands

#### Mercenaries

This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For
warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of
wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men
from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple
of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders
for the Emperor’s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the
Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three
contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are fighting for.
Warbands from different places will vary in many respects,
offering different benefits as well as having a unique
appearance and character.

##### Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is
Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the
Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of
Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the
Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler
of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the
throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed
to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional
warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders
disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and
practical wargear. In battle they often wear coloured ribbons
as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud
of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and
contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they
sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.
Special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of
military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty
between officers and men. To represent this, fighters may use
their Captain’s Leadership if within 12" rather than the usual
6".
A strong tradition of martial training is also responsible for
the high standards of archery amongst the people of
Reikland. All Marksmen therefore add +1 to their Ballistic
Skill, whether they are recruited when the Warband is first
formed or added later.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Middenheim

Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by
dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as
the City of the White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves
and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the
city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and

Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of
Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief
contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has
always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers
and the Temple of Sigmar.
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a
well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts
which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain
a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are
famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into
battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons
of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look
especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies
howling their brutal battle-cries.
Special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the
Champions and Captains of a Middenheim warband start
with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### Marienburg

Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in
the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which alone
conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling
cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array
of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven
kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the
east. The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to
man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg
there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit.
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High Order
of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst
mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of
men feel themselves shackled by the old order and are eager
to seize power for themselves. Their champion for the
Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen
influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s
claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown
her that denied Marienburg the throne driving a wedge
between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and
armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish
and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has
earned them grudging respect. Their chief skills lie in
duelling and in the use of poisons and other clandestine
fighting methods. Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and
wear jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather coats,
bandanas and short swords that are easy to conceal.
Special rules


As natural traders with contacts in the merchant guilds
Marienburg warbands receive a +1 bonus when attempting to
find rare items (see the Trading section for rules).
To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start off with
an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when fighting in a
campaign. 
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Choice of warriors

A Mercenary warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns available to spend. The
maximum number of warriors in the warband may never
exceed 15.

Captain: Each Mercenary warband must have one Captain:
no more, no less!
Champions: Your warband may include up to two
Champions.
Youngbloods: Your warband may include up to two
Youngbloods.
Warriors: Your warband may include any number of
Warriors.
Marksmen: Your warband may include no more than seven
Marksmen.
Swordsmen: Your warband may include no more than five
Swordsmen.
##### Starting experience

The Captain starts with 20 experience.
Champions start with 8 experience.
Youngbloods start with 0 experience.

1 Mercenary Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
A Mercenary Captain is a tough professional warrior, a man who
will fight for anyone or against anything so long as the price is
right. Mordheim offers such a man the chance to become rich
beyond his dreams, though at great risk. But as ruthlessness and
lack of mercy and pity are the hallmarks of a successful Mercenary
Captain, it is no wonder that they flock to Mordheim.

In any Mercenary warband there is one warrior who is bigger,
stronger (and often uglier) than his comrades. These men are called
Champions (or berserkers, first swordsmen and various other
names). Champions are amongst the toughest and the best fighters
in the warband. They often answer challenges issued to the warband
and, after the Captain, they get the pick of any equipment and loot.

warband leaders, as their skills are ideally suited for fighting in
Mordheim.

#### Averlander

Averland lies in the south of the Empire, between the rivers
Aver and Upper Reik and borders upon the Black Mountains
and the huge range that is the Worlds Edge Mountains. It’s a
prosperous province, though it’s neither one of the largest or
most influential in the Empire. The Black Mountains and the
World Edge Mountains harbour plenty of mines, many are in
Dwarf possession. The metal ore is sold at a good profit in
Averheim, the provincial capital, to merchants from Nuln,
who transport it on barges down the river Aver. The
mountains contain several ancient Dwarf strongholds but
Night Goblins or Skaven has overrun several of them, while
others have been lost in violent volcanic eruptions.
The Black Fire Pass guards an important trade route between
the Borderlands and the Empire; it divides the World Edge
Mountains from the Black Mountains. The route is an old
Dwarf road and extends past Averheim and further north into
the Empire. Goods from the Black Fire pass are usually
shipped along the Aver River to Nuln. The pass is the only
place to cross the mountains, as the mountainsides are
extremely steep and almost impossible to pass. Not to
mention that the weather is notoriously unpredictable and few
dare risk being caught in a snow blizzard or avalanche. As if
things weren’t bad enough the mountains are home to fierce
tribes of Night Goblins, Trolls, Skaven and legendary
monsters. Some daring adventurers have made a living off
stealing eggs from the tallest peaks and selling them to the
Imperial Zoo. These beasts will be brought up to become
mounts for famous generals.
Averland is a rich province and as a result exorbitant sums of
money are spent on the uniforms of the state soldiers.
Seasoned veterans prefer flamboyant uniforms to make them
stand out compared to the peasant, but also to reflect their
seniority. This tradition has seeped down through the ranks to
a point where even the militia and mercenary bands strive to
have as flamboyant clothing as they can afford. The
Averlander army is said to employ enough tailors to supply a
small city! Outsiders joke that the Averlanders are such great
archers because they do not want to get up close and personal
as they risk tearing or bloodying their clothes. Such remarks
are hushed down in the presence of a veteran of the Black
Fire Pass though, or else the jester will soon find himself in
the gutter with a few missing teeth. The practice of wearing
outrageous clothing has certainly appealed to the diminutive
race of Halflings and tailors are constantly being asked to
shorten sleeves and add a little extra width to the waist. Many

Young recruits are disheartened to learn that they are
disallowed from wearing the stunning uniform until they
have served at least a year in the army. These ‘Youngbloods’
are by no means regarded as professional soldiers yet and
have to make do with more simple clothing.
The Bergjaeger are a special detachment of the Black Fire
Pass guard that is made up of trappers and rangers from the
surrounding mountains. They are experts at moving silently
through rocky terrain and are often used as scouts. The
background of a ranger is as varied as there are rangers, and
most of them have a story to tell. Some were gamekeepers
who have lost their job or found it too uninspiring.
Somewhere poachers press-ganged into the army to avoid
serving prison time. Some might have been rustlers who
decided to flee to the militia when the angry farmers came
too close to catching him. Whatever their background they
are expert marksmen and well suited to a life in the bleak
mountain wilderness.

##### Heroes

1 Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
The Captain of a mercenary warband is typically a middle-aged
veteran soldier of the Imperial army, most likely he was a sergeant
or other petty officer. The survival of a mercenary warband relies
more on the wit and experience of its captain, than on how good a
fighter he is. It’s all too common that an inexperienced captain will
lead his men into an ambush, or lead them on a long journey with
no food or supplies. Being a successful captain means that your men
will follow you to hell and back, and plenty of gold crowns and
feasting. A captain that fails in his duty to keep his men alive and
well fed will at best find himself deserted and worst end up with a
knife in his back.

Some captains are merchants or nobles that are looking for a
chance at making some extra money. The brighter captains hire the
service of a veteran as his sergeant, and leave all the practical

scars and the cynicism that marks a soldier of the army.

The Bergjaeger are trappers and rangers from the mountains that
surround the Black Fire pass. They are experts at moving silently
through terrain and are used as scouts. In addition they make good
use of animal traps to delay or divide a group of enemies.
Bergjaeger are not professional soldiers and rely more on stealth
and cunning than a strong sword-arm to survive.

Set Traps: Bergjaeger are expert trappers and hunters and
these skills can be put to great use in the ruins of Mordheim.
A Bergjaeger may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing
else (he may not set traps if he’s just recovered from being
Knocked Down). Place a marker in base contact with the
Bergjaeger. When a model, friend or foe, moves within 2" of
the marker he risks setting off the trap – roll a D6. On a score
of 3+ he has triggered the trap and suffers a S4 hit (note that
the Bergjaeger won’t trigger his own traps). If the trap did not
wound the model or it didn’t trigger, the ‘victim’ may finish
his move otherwise he is placed knocked Down or Stunned
2" from the marker. Regardless whether the trap was
triggered or not, the marker is removed.

0-1 Youngblood
15 gold crowns to hire
Although Empire armies are comprised of mature men there are
plenty of jobs for youths as there is always a demand for extra help
in the kitchens or as fetchers. Some of these youths actually join a
band of mercenaries or regiment in pursuit of a romantic dream of
fame and adventure. Some are herdsmen who hoped to find an
easier way of filling their belly than the hard and uncertain business
of looking after animals, not to mention that its quite dull!

Mountainguard
30 gold crowns to hire
The Mountainguard is the famous garrison of the Black Fire Pass
that has repelled countless greenskin invasion attempts. Their
traditional uniform is yellow and black and it’s a merit in the
Averland army to have served a few years at the mountain-pass. The
Mountain guard train both with the traditional Imperial weapons,
the halberd and the sword, and with the crossbow and bow.
Veterans are often employed by mercenary warbands who know that
their presence will certainly boost their chances in the battles to
come. Some of these veterans advance to become sergeants or even
captains themselves. There are a few warbands that consists solely
of Mountainguard veterans, often from the same regiment or the
survivors of a great battle.

Marksmen

Being a Marksmen is not as simple as picking up a bow and try to
hit your enemies. A Marksman has to train for years to master his
chosen weapon, Imperial enlisters often visit archery competitions
to try and enlist a couple of expert archers. Some Marksmen are
trained with black powder weapons instead of the traditional bow or
crossbow. Marksmen often own their own weapons, as the cost of a
handgun is as high as hiring the Marksman himself! Thus the
Marksmen are not forced to do as much hard labour as the militia.

pass and the Moot was devastated. Ever since then the Moot urge
their gamekeepers to serve at least a few years in the garrison that

#### Ostlander

‘My only crime was to get in a brawl with some pig farmer outside of the Donkey’s Nut Tavern and the next thing I knew a
dozen of his brothers were after my blood.’ Udo Verkonnen, Freesword
The Principality of Ostland is the most sparsely inhabited of
all of the Empire’s Electoral Provinces. Its people have more
ties with the land of Kislev to the north than they do to their
countrymen to the south. This is because the Forest of
Shadows and the Middle Mountains form two natural barriers
between Ostland and the rest of the Empire. Within the Forest
of Shadows are vast amounts of wild game but also darker
creatures such as Chaos Beastmen and Forest Goblins. The
Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the
Empire and their peaks are inhabited by a large number of
Ogres.
Ostland’s isolation has greatly shaped its inhabitants and they
are a poor but hardy folk. Each small village lives barely
above subsistence levels and is usually composed of one
large extended family. The men of Ostland are tall and broad-
shouldered while the women tend to either be tall and
whippet thin or short and stout. Married men are usually dirt
farmers who also gather roots, tubers and nuts in the forests,
while unmarried men spend their lives as trappers and
hunters. The worship of Taal, the God of Forests and Beasts,
is very popular in the region although there is some worship
of Taal’s wife Ryha and his brother Ulric in the more
westerly villages.
While not warlike by nature, Ostlanders are never opposed to
a good honest drunken brawl and with their love of dark ales
these sorts of scraps are not uncommon. During the Great
War against Chaos, Ostlanders rallied in great numbers to
wield bow and spear in defence of their Kislevite neighbours.
More than any other part of the Empire, Ostland has tasted
the lash of Chaos and their hatred of the evil ones knows no
bounds.

##### Special Rules

Self-Sufficient: The men of Ostland have no desire to give
their hard-earned gold to outsiders. As a result they can never
hire any Mercenaries except for Ogres (who are not an
uncommon sight in Ostland).
Nouveau Riche: Ostlanders are almost universally poor.
Many Ostlanders never see coined money in their entire life
and those that do are often overcome with giddiness at the
mere sight of wealth. As a result, Ostlanders MUST sell all of
their Wyrdstone (unless they have more than 8 pieces in
which case they must only sell 8) after every battle and after
hiring new warriors (which may be done first) at least 50% of
the remaining gold MUST be spent on a single item of gear.
This means that Ostlander Warbands will often be composed
of a dozen men wearing muddy peasant garb with one
member wearing golden-laid heavy armor and another
carrying a double-barrelled hunting rifle from the finest
forges of Hochland.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### Choice of Warriors

An Ostlander Warband is often made up of an extended
family of Ostlanders. Fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and
even the occasion tough-as-nails aunt all join together to form
the Warband. The ‘family’ must include a minimum of 3
models and a maximum of 15. You have 500 Gold Crowns
that you can use to recruit your initial warband.
Elder: Each Ostlander Warband must have one Elder, no
more, no less!
Blood-Brothers: Your Warband may include up to 2 Blood-
Brothers.
Priest of Taal: Your Warband may include up to 1 Priest of
Taal.
Kin: You may have any number of Kin.

forests of the Northern Empire. It is unclear why the priests of the
forest have begun to join bands of Ostlanders in their delvings into
the ruined city of Mordheim – for the servants of Taal keep their
own counsel. Suffice to say that the Forest-God is clearly building a
strong presence both in and around the darkened ruins as more and
more animals begin to fill the surrounding forests...

More than anywhere in the Empire Ogres are most commonplace
within the hilly, pine forested landscape of Ostland. These brutish
creatures are very sought after by the rough mountain men of
Ostland as muscle in the Warband. An Ogre’s strength is near
legendary and their ability to sustain an awful lot of punishment
during a fight make these the perfect shock troops of any Warband.
Of course, an Ogre’s appetite is nearly as well renowned as their
fighting abilities and so they are rather expensive to keep.

Special Rules
Fear: Ogre-kin are large, threatening creatures that cause
Fear. See the Psychology section for details.
Large: Ogre-kin are huge, lumbering creatures and therefore

Some Ostlander men choose not to marry but instead to spend their
times alone in the forests of the Old World. While these rangers do
not share the close family bonds of a typical Ostlander Blood-kin
they are well respected for their knowledge of the woods and their
rugged determination. Poor Jaeger usually wield a simple home-
made bow but it is every Jaeger’s dream to one day own a
blackpowder weapon and hunting rifle, especially double-barrelled
versions, as these are a sign of great prestige amongst the hunters of
the deep woods.

buffoons stagger their way through the streets of Mordheim yelling
slurred insults at whomever they meet, committing petty acts of
vandalism and generally making a mess of things. This comic
behaviour is often misconstrued into a false belief that they are
harmless, a belief that many live to regret. Fuelled by vast quantities
of booze these are very dangerous, unpredictable men indeed who
will shove a broken bottle into your face as soon as laugh heartily
and burst into song!

which would otherwise allow them to do so.
Special Rules
Drunk: Ruffians are blasted out of their tiny minds on rotgut
spirits and cheap ale. As such, they automatically pass all
Leadership based tests they are required to take.
No Respect: Ruffians are objects of a strange mix of pity and
abject fear for their fellows and may never become a
Warband leader.


#### Nuln Engineers

Based on Imperial Gunnery School of Nuln from the Nemesis Crown and Nuln Engineers By Josh Alexander
The Province of Nuln is renowned throughout the Empire as
a centre of commerce and knowledge, especially in the field
of engineering, the home to the finest handguns and war
machines, save for those constructed by the Dwarves. The
Imperial Gunnery School located there trains apprentices in
the intricacies of weapon design and maintenance, and is
crucial to the dominance of the armies of the Empire. The
relatively new science of black powder technology is
relentlessly researched and tested in Nuln, borrowing theories
from dwarf engineers and developing new ones through sheer
human ingenuity.
Nuln produces the majority of the cannons and other artillery
desired commodity used by the Empire army. In addition,
most of the handguns and pistols are manufactured in the city
as well. Its garrison is therefore unusually well armed, and
most enemies would rather mount an expedition into the
chaos wastes than an assault on Nuln.
Most of the students at the school come from the Imperial nobility,
sons who show talents in mathematics or an interest in things that
go boom, as well as not being immediately in line for succession.
Once they graduate, students are given the choice of staying in the
school for further studies (and eventually becoming a Master
Gunner) or returning home. For some the prospect of yet more
years of studies will send them home where they will go on to fight
as an army’s pistoleers or outriders, the others do attain their
pinnacle and get to watch their former trainees charge across the
battlefield, often to their deaths.
Mordheim presents an irresistible opportunity to the aged
scholars of Nuln, as the mysterious wyrdstone is said to have
many useful properties. The few shards that have found their
way to Nuln have successfully been used in the creation of
more efficient black powder, as well as the basis of a new
alloy for gunmetal and cannonballs. However, the high cost
the shards accrue on the secondary market makes them a rare
and expensive commodity. Rather than entrust their interests
to the mercenary rabble that wander the lands of the Empire,
the Master Engineers of Nuln have sent out several Engineers
to fetch as many shards of wyrdstone as they can carry. In
their eyes, it is cheaper to simply replace a warband
slaughtered in the ruins than to pay the extra amount for the
scant wyrdstone that is available. These engineers gather
together some of their students and a few city guard and
depart, taking pains to bring along plenty of weapons and
ammunition. While less than pleased at their new occupation,
the engineers owe their very livelihood to the Master
Engineers of Nuln, and grudgingly comply with their edicts.
Engineer warbands are unusual, even for the eclectic rabble
that fights in the ruins. While they employ a few soldiers for
their practical knowledge, most of the groups consist of
academic, scholarly individuals. Many of these scientists
have served in the armies of the Empire and have military
training, rusty though it may be. Some leaders underestimate
the danger they present, for what they lack in ferocity and
strength they make up for with sheer firepower. It is usually
easy to determine if a Nuln warband is fighting nearby,
because the gunshots echo through the deserted ruins and can
be heard even from outside the city walls.

##### Special Rules

Impeccable Care: Amongst one of the first things that the
students are taught is to take proper care of their equipment
and the right way to perform that maintenance. Once they
have mastered this function, they learn to repair the same
weapons should they become damaged and because of this
they can buy such black powder weapons on the cheap and
quickly return them to good working order. As a result they
can buy these weapons at a fairly reduced price! They can
ALWAYS use the reduced cost for black powder weapons
listed in their starting Equipment List, and they gain an
additional +2 on rare rolls to find any black powder weapons
since people don’t mind selling broken guns!
Properly Used: The students know the proper way to use
their weapons, spending many hours on the school’s shooting
range. This is considered to be a good use of time between
lessons and recommended by all the school’s instructors,
after all if the students constantly blow themselves up with
their weapons, there wouldn’t be many graduates. When
using the optional Misfire rules, if a one is rolled, roll a
second dice. On a 3+ the misfire is ignored (the shot still
misses, but the weapon does NOT explode).
Proud To A Fault!: Anyone studying at the Imperial
Gunnery School is very proud of this fact, as it is a great
honour to be accepted. After they start using black powder
weapons, students recognise the superiority of these weapons
and refuse to bend their knee to the ‘lesser’ ranged weapons.
The members of this warband NEVER use any non-black
powder ranged weapons (this prohibition does NOT apply to
hired swords or dramatis personae, as they are hired help and
have not received proper Nuln training).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Heroes

1 Engineer
65 gold crowns to hire
Engineers oversee the training of apprentices and are always
exacting and precise. They epitomize the technological innovation of
Nuln, and their aim is usually as keen as their intellect. Instead of
dominating their warbands with fear or brute force, Engineers earn
respect through their experience and technical knowledge.

Special Rules
Leader: Any models in the warband within 6” of the
Engineer may use his Leadership instead of their own.
Precision: Engineers are trained to discern the most efficient
manner to achieve their goals. When shooting, they may
choose any target in range that they can see, rather than the
closest target.

0-1 Instructor
45 gold crowns to hire
The gunners of Nuln are the most respected in the Old World. They
are in charge of keeping up the mighty Empire war machines such
as the great cannons. They are well educated and extensively
trained, but not yet too battle-hardened, so these excursions give
them field experience, even in the smallest things.

0-1 Senior Student
45 gold crowns to hire
The upperclassmen at the school are well acquainted with the forms
of combat and mechanics used by the Empire. The years of using
pistols and firing cannons has given them plenty of experience with
weaponry and this is not their first excursion into the wilds of the
Empire. It is likely to be their last before they graduate.

This is the first excursion for these freshmen, who have had maybe

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Sons of the Gun
25 gold crowns to hire
Orphans left on the doorsteps of the school, well cared for and
trained to take care of the constructs as apprentices and assistants.
Many go on to form gun crews for the cannons taken into battle and
some even rise as far as commanding such crews. For the most part
they remain a background element to the successful workings of any
cannon or black powder weapon and have become an essential part
of the school. On the excursions, sons of the guns provide a much
needed set of arms to carry provisions and spare powder, as well as
providing much needed additional firepower in a fight.

Guardsmen are the hired soldiers that form the police force of Nuln.

never let their rifles out of arm’s reach, and are much feared due to
their legendary accuracy.

weapon other than a blunderbuss, roll a die. On a 4+, the gun
is automatically reloaded and does not have to miss a turn
before being able to fire again.


#### Cult of the Possessed

There is never any shortage of men willing to risk their lives
for a chance of real power: men whose ambitions lie beyond
the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or
physical deformities place them in constant danger of
persecution. What do such men have to lose if they pledge
their souls to the dark gods of Chaos! In the aftermath of the
destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have
appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the
stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical
gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of
the Witch Hunters.
Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims
lordship of the City of the Damned. He is called the
Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the
cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their
souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or
Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do
his bidding.
As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of
magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to
stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that proliferates in
Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all
natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once
men but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods
they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their
appearance is horrific – corrupted from within, their flesh is
twisted into a new and monstrous form.
With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers
of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. In the
Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of the Possessed ambushed
and destroyed a large force sent in to hunt them down. Now
the streets of Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his
servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at all or,
more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption. Men who
venture into Mordheim alone are hunted down and sacrificed
to the dark gods. All warbands of the Possessed gather
wyrdstone for the Shadowlord who remains hidden in the Pit
where he is said to be guarded by titanic Possessed the size of

houses. A few shards of the precious stone are kept by the
warbands and used to create more of the Possessed.
The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and each
leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark gods of Chaos.
These are men whose hunger for power knows no bounds,
who willingly give their bodies over to possession. All take
part in the blood sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of
Daemons – nothing is too base for them! These degenerate
humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they – things
half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors, and which men
refer to as Beastmen.
There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband. Deranged
warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave jagged weapons
and chant blasphemous rites as they throw themselves upon
their foes. Many are hardly recognisable as human, their
bodies are so scarred and disfigured. The stigmata of
mutation is borne by most, but the most unsettling of all are
the Possessed themselves – melded flesh made of men,
beasts, and metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon.
##### Special Rules

Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is always Chaotic.
##### Choice of warriors

A Possessed warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial

0-2 The Possessed
90 gold crowns to hire (+ the cost of mutations)
The Possessed have committed the greatest of heresies: they have
given their bodies to Daemons. As a result, they are nightmarish
creatures, a melding of flesh, metal and black magic. Inside them
lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches
of the Realm of Chaos.
The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several creatures
together, be they men or animals, into a multi-faceted horror. These
monstrous Possessed are perhaps the most dangerous of the
creatures of Mordheim, and certainly the most loathsome and
dreadful.

Darksouls are men who have been driven insane by the daemonic
possession which became all too common after the destruction of

minds have been scarred by the horror of the experience.
Their insane strength makes Darksouls dangerous fighters. The
Cultists regard them as holy men, and let them work out their
unreasoning rage in battle. In their tortured minds the Darksouls
believe themselves to be Daemons. They wear leering daemonic

scaled skin of Daemons.

#### The Carnival of Chaos

No one knows from whence it came, the dreaded Carnival of
Chaos. Some have rumoured that it was once a gypsy caravan
from the east of the Empire, wandering folk that brought their
colourful fare from village to village entertaining the poor
rural folk of the Empire with their lavish shows and stage
plays. If this past is the truth then what it has become in the
present is far more sinister and deadly. Still it wanders the
rural backwaters of the Empire, in a colourful cavalcade of
wagons, its folk dressed in the colourful finery of travelling
players, bringing sonnet and song to excitable villagers and
peasants.
Upon reaching a new settlement, these outlandish showmen
erect their stage and entertain the poor rural folk with songs
and plays of the dark days of the Empire. Tales such as: ‘The
Emperor’s True Face’, ‘Orfeo and Pustulate’, ‘Papa Noigul’s
Festering Children’ and ‘A Midsummer Nightmare’ wow the
enraptured throng.
Strongmen perform feats of incredible prowess to the
adoration of the crowd, whilst players in garish, grinning
masks juggle balls, knives and flaming brands. As the
crowd’s numbers increase, a fool in bright jester’s garb with
an inflated pig’s bladder on a stick leaps from one enthralled
watcher to the next joking and cackling, poking and
prodding.
It is only when the show reaches its blasphemous climax, as
the sun begins to set, that the truth of the Carnival of Chaos is
revealed in all its putrid, festering glory. For these are no
mere wandering thespians and entertainers. When the players
perform their final act, known as the ‘Dance of Death’, the
enchantments covering their true visages slowly slip away
revealing them to their blissfully ignorant audience for they
are cavorting, cyclopean daemons with rotting flesh hanging
from yellowing bones. What were originally considered
intricately decorated masks and cleverly applied make-up is
soon revealed as the players’ true horribly mutated faces,
covered in pustules and pox-ridden lesions. As the villagers’
expressions turn from those of elation to abject terror at the
sight of these horrific visions the slaughter begins. By now
most of the folk who made up the cheering audience would
have already succumbed to the virulent diseases spread by
these malevolent players. The insidious Carnival Master,
accompanied by his cackling fool, rounds up those
unfortunate women and children that remain alive, taking a
finger from each of his new brides, exclaiming “You’re my
wife now!”. The survivors are then led away to an unknown
fate and the village is left deserted, its inhabitants and
livestock killed by innumerable diseases and plague.
The Carnival of Chaos is the sick joke of the Great Lord of
Decay, the Chaos god known as Nurgle. Thrice cursed
Nurgle is also known as the unspeakable Master of Plague

and Pestilence and the players in the Carnival are his corrupt
followers and worshippers. They are those who have sold
their souls for a twisted form of immortality through
embracing death, destruction and decay – learning to love
Nurgle’s many and varied gifts. It is not known how many
Carnivals of Chaos there are or if the handful of reports from
the lips of petrified witnesses all refer to the same warband.
The leader of the Carnival of Chaos is known as the Carnival
Master and is reputed to be a sorcerer of great power,
wielding the unclean magic of his lord to cause suffering and
death through disease and decay. Through dark ritual and
sacrifice, the Carnival Master summons forth the cackling,
decaying Daemons of his patron god to take part in the
twisted masquerade. His mortal followers carefully nurture
their newly acquired diseases, blessings of their gregarious
deity and vie for power and advancement under his watchful
gaze. The most blessed of these twisted, insane creatures are
those known as the Tainted Ones. These are often the right-
hand ‘men’ of the Carnival Master and their bodies are
wracked with a multitude of foul diseases and mutation. The
Carnival of Chaos is justly hunted by the many bands of
zealous Witch Hunters that traverse the lands but always
seems to be just one step ahead of the Sigmarites and
continues to follow its merry path, bringing the blessings of
Nurgle to all.

These lead the diabolical Carnivals of Chaos. They are the chosen
of Nurgle and wield sorcerous powers gifted to them by their
pestilential god. The Master is a power-crazed individual that leads
his coven of Daemonic entertainers throughout the backwaters of
the Empire, tainting villages and settlements with disease. To the
backward peasantry of the Empire’s rural settlements, the Master
comes across as an exotic and charismatic showman bringing
outlandish entertainment into their otherwise dreary lives. It is the

0-2 Brutes
60 Gold Crowns to hire
These are a very specific type of mutant that have had their
constitution bolstered by the unnatural vitality of the Lord of Decay.
Nurgle’s foul attention has transformed what were once men into
massive, statuesque creatures rippling with diseased muscles and a
supernatural vigour. Brutes are immensely strong individuals and
their part in the masquerade that is the Carnival of Chaos is as
strongmen performing feats of strength to entertain the crowds.
They are nearly always hooded in the nature of executioners for
although their bodies appear outwardly strong and healthy, their
faces are often riddled with disease and are half-decayed. In battle,
they wield huge hammers and flails with reckless abandon, whirling
them around their heads like children’s toys.

The Tainted Ones are those that are most blessed and favoured of
Father Nurgle. They hold a position of great importance within the
hierarchy of the Carnival. They are often heavily robed and
protected by powerful enchantments, for beneath their robes are
unspeakable horrors. The bodies of the Tainted Ones are so
wracked with disease and mutation that it is unsafe for even the
other mortal members of the warband to touch their bare skin.
Ironically, they take the most prestigious role in the Carnival – the
fool. The Tainted Ones leap and prance about the audience, dressed
as jesters, when the Carnival is performing, laughing and joking
with the gathered throng infecting them with their multitude of
horrendous maladies. These twisted creatures are exceptionally
dangerous opponents in combat too, for it is said that they carry the
dreaded and incurable Nurgle’s Rot.

0–2 Plague Bearers
50 Gold Crowns to hire
Plague Bearers are daemons of the Chaos god Nurgle, also known
as the Lord of Decay. They can be identified by their cyclopean
faces and horrifically decayed bodies. Their entrails hang from
tattered holes in their grey-green, poxridden flesh and the aura of
death and decay surrounds them. They are sometimes known as the
Tallymen of Plagues or Maggotkin and are highly revered by the
mortal members of the warband. As with all Daemons they can
never be killed or destroyed for good so long as the power of their
god prevails. However, their presence in the mortal world is tenuous
and can only be maintained for long periods by Dark Magic and
sacrifice. In the Carnival, the Plague Bearers revel in their showy
roles as stage actors and players, dressing in filth encrusted but
ostentatious doublet and hose.

flies, which buzz around them and their combat opponent.
They do not affect the Plague Bearer but distract foes by
buzzing into eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Plague Bearer’s
close combat opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all
attacks.

Stream of Corruption: Plague Bearers can spew forth a
grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is
counted as a shooting attack with a range of 6" and is
resolved at Strength 3 with no saves for armor.
Demonic: Plague Bearers are Daemons of the lord of disease,
Nurgle, and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Plague Bearers are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Plague Bearers are Daemons and do
not know the concept of fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership-based test they are required to take.
Cause Fear: Plague Bearers are horrifying supernatural
creatures and therefore cause fear.
Daemonic Aura: Due to the magical, intangible nature of
Daemons they have a special Armor save of 5+. This is
modified by the Strength of the attack as normal and is
completely negated by magic weapons and spells. Plague
Bearers’ attacks are considered as magical also.
Daemonic Instability: Plague Bearers are bound to the
world by Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If
taken out of action a Plague Bearer is banished and
effectively destroyed on a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for
injury). In addition, if the warband routs then every Plague
Bearer in the warband must take an immediate Leadership
test. If this test is failed, then the Plague Bearer counts as
destroyed.


Nurglings
15 Gold Crowns to hire
Nurglings are tiny Daemons of Nurgle and are viewed by other
followers of the pus god as akin to his beloved children. They are
like rotten boils with legs and razor sharp teeth, that pick and tear
and infect their foes with filth-encrusted claws. Nurglings are
generally more of a nuisance in a fight than any real threat but in
sufficient numbers can overwhelm even the toughest of warriors.
Nurglings are mischievous little bundles of filth and pus and take
great delight in their part in the Carnival of Chaos, not only as
musicians but also as fools and slapstick comedians. Nurglings
often befriend the children of each village they visit, only revealing
their foul identity to their terrified victims at the final stage of
‘Nurgle’s Great Play’.

Special Rules
Cloud of Flies: Nurglings are surrounded by a cloud of flies,
which buzz around them and their combat opponent. They do
not affect the Nurglings but distract foes by buzzing into
eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Nurgling’s close combat
opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all attacks.
Swarm: You may summon as many Nurglings as you wish
(i.e.. you may have more than five Nurglings in a Henchman
group).
Daemonic: Nurglings are Daemons of the diseased Lord
Nurgle and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Nurglings are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally

warband routs then every Nurgling in the warband must take

Nurgling counts as destroyed.

Brethren
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Brethren are the crazed and devoted followers of Nurgle the Lord of
Decay. They have totally embraced the philosophy of the great Lord
of Decay and the path of damnation is the road that they have
chosen. Most brethren are infected with foul diseases and some have
even started to decay. Their faces are covered in warts and boils
and other lesser gifts of their lord. In the Carnival, the Brethren take
on all of the minor roles: stagehands, puppeteers, etc.

0–1 Plague Cart
250 Gold Crowns to hire
The Plague Cart is the embodiment of Nurgle and the core of the
Carnival of Chaos. Bedecked in the colourful, garish finery of the
coaches of travelling players and thespians, the Cart easily draws
the eyes of the dull and bland peasantry of the villages. However,
the canvas is tattered and rotten, the frame splintered and bent, the
metalwork pitted and rusted and the steeds rotted and dank. Few
mortals have ever seen the interior of one of these most sinister of
vehicles for it is only the Carnival Master and his Daemonic
minions that are permitted entry. It is rumoured that these
ramshackle wagons contain a pentagram daubed with dark runes of
incredible potency that actually creates a portal to the realms of
Chaos and the dwelling place of great Nurgle himself.

Weapons/Armor: None. The Plague Cart’s Guardian is equipped with
a scythe, though it may not equip anything else. The Cart
is pulled by 2 horses and has a 5+ Armour Save.
Special Rules
Transport: Warband members on foot may ride inside the cart by 
moving into base contact with it - if they do so the cart may not move that
turn (or move any further if it already did). The Cart only has space inside 
for up to 4 wounds worth of passengers. Warriors may disembark from the Cart
at the end of each movement phase, though doing so takes up their entire 
movement. This move may be used to charge into combat with enemies already 
in contact with the cart, but that is all. Any occupants still 
inside the Cart if it is destroyed are placed in its stead and are Knocked Down.

Plague Cart: The cart's enclosed cabin provides excellent protection
to the passengers within, its wooden chassis reinforced with
unnaturally resilient twists of blubbery yet fibrous growth.
Warriors inside the cart may not be the target of shooting, spells, 
or attacks - though effects that damage all models in an area will 
effect all occupants. They also may not attack, shoot, or cast spells from
within it.

Ramshackle: Tall, wonky-wheeled, and distinctly box-like in shape these
wagons are designed for hauling stage props through the city rather than
for any type of speed or combat. The Plague Cart functions exactly like a
chariot, except it causes no Impact Hits.

Guardian: The Guardian comes as part of the Plague Cart. In
fact, more often than not he is physically bonded to the cart in
some twisted nightmare of flesh and wood. He may therefore
never dismount from the cart or leave under any
circumstances. The entire Cart rolls as one entity for injury rolls if it
is taken Out of Action, and it may never gain experience.
The Plague Cart and Guardian are considered Daemonic, and are 
Immune to Psychology.

#### Beastmen Raiders

The Beastmen are brutish, wild and unnatural creatures that
live in the deep forests. Anyone travelling through this
untamed wilderness risks being attacked by these
unpredictable raiders. Many of those who dwell within the
forests around the outskirts of Mordheim claim that these vile
creatures of Chaos outnumber mankind, though such
statements are impossible to prove, for the Beastmen build no
cities and do not create any structured form of society as
such. Order and organisation are alien and hated by them, and
they roam where they will, pillaging and killing for whatever
they have need or want for. They willingly turn on each
other, picking on the weakest amongst them for food and fun.
The Beastmen naturally form into roaming warbands, though
whether they do so consciously or merely instinctively is
unknown. A small warband is able to move swiftly through
the wilderness unnoticed, and can cover hundreds of miles
each season as they travel where they will. They are led by
the strongest and most ferocious of their kind, and if ever one
within the warband senses a weakness in their leader, they
will turn on him in a brutish leadership challenge that can
only result in one of the two being killed and consumed by
the victor. Literally thousands of these small warbands infest
the dark forests of the Old World, preying upon travellers and
farmsteads.
A Beastmen warband attacks without warning, and villagers,
merchants and travellers live in constant fear of ambush from
these forest denizens. They try to prepare themselves for such
an event, and often desperately appeal to the nobles to scour
the forests with their State troops – however, at such a time of
political upheaval, the nobles have far more pressing
concerns than the pleas of low-born villagers. Forced to fend
for themselves, terrified villagers hack down great swathes of
the forest around their settlements, and sometimes hire the
services of mercenaries to protect them, barricading
themselves indoors when they hear rumours of a marauding
band within the area. Nevertheless, purges of the forest are
nearly always hopeless, for the Beastmen warbands generally
move far away from an area they have struck well before
organised retaliation can be mounted.
The more isolated farms and villages are most at risk
from attack, being far from any aid. Frequently, travellers
will discover buildings and farms burnt to the ground, cattle
butchered and lying where they were cut down. Full of
malevolence, Beastmen take particular delight in tearing
down the carefully constructed and ordered structures of men.
They smash down fences and rip buildings down to rubble,
allowing them to be reclaimed by the forests. They
maliciously soil and blight painstakingly planted crops, and
will tear the throats from newborn lambs merely for sport.
Beastmen warbands often form temporary encampments,
from which to raid the surrounding areas. These are crude
things, usually little more than a place to store any plundered
loot and food. They may include roughly staked out pens for
their massive war hounds or for holding captives – both are
taunted and starved for no other reason than it is in the
Beastmens nature to behave so. Typically, a warband will
remain at this encampment until it makes one sizeable raid,
whereupon the Beastman chief will move his camp to another
area. These encampments are often positioned nearby roads

and settlements, for such areas are ripe for plunder. The
Beastmen are a constant threat, and even if travellers are
lucky enough not to encounter them, their presence can
always be felt, watching and waiting in the twisted shadows
amongst the dark trees. None can predict their movements,
and many live in constant fear of their attacks.
Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and
Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and
are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging
power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which
makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting
regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are
comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the
awesome vitality of the Beastmen.
Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually
resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other
variations are also known to exist. The Beastmen are divided
into to two distinct breeds: Ungors, who are more numerous,
twisted creatures that combine the worst qualities of man and
beast, and Bestigors, a giant breed of Beastmen, a mix
between some powerful animal and man.
The Ungor are smaller Beastmen, who cannot compete with
Bestigors in strength and power. They may have one horn or
many, but these won’t be recognised as those of goat.
Bray Shaman are very special Beastmen and are revered by
all Beastmen, for they are the prophets and servants of Chaos
Powers.
Each warband of Beastmen includes a mix of some Bestigor,
Gor warriors and Ungor who are the mainstay of the tribes.
Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests
surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak,
Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others.
The shards of the meteorite are seen as holy objects, which
can be sold to the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans
in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors.
For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are
part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the
civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the
taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then
the Beastmen shall inherit.
Appearance: Beastmen Bestigor stand some six-seven feet
tall, and their heavily muscled bodies are covered with fur.
Ungor are lesser Beastmen, no larger than Humans, but their
tough bodies and vicious tempers easily make them a match
to any Human warrior.
Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the fur of
their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their
vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck.
While most Beastmen have dark brown skin and fur, black-
furred or even albino Beastmen are not unknown.
Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as
armor as well as decoration.
Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the
Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to
create, but to destroy.


##### Special Rules

Infighting: Beastmen are creatures of abhorrant temprament, and have 
more in common with Orcs than Humans when it comes to patience and 
discipline. At the start of your movement phase if there are any Gors 
or Ungors who did not charge an enemy but who are within charge range of
an allied henchman they must take a Leadership test. If the Gor or Ungor
fails the test, he must attempt to charge one allied henchman within range 
(the player may choose which). The Gor or Ungor will then fight the allied
henchman in the player's combat phase and, assuming they both survived, will
move the combatants 1" apart at the end of their turn. A Gor or Ungor that kills
an allied henchman in their way gains +1 experience. Hero Gors or Ungors are
so brash and arrogant that they will even target allied heroes. Warbands in 
Formal Alliances that are attacked by Beastmen in this way may break the alliance 
in their turn in reparation.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

##### Choice of Warriors

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband is 15, though some buildings in the
warband’s encampment may increase this.

Chief: no more, no less!
Shaman: Your warband may include a single Beastmen

#### Shadow Warrior Warbands

Nagarythe was once one of the most prosperous and beautiful
of the kingdoms of the High Elven land of Ulthuan. When the
Witch King Malekith and his mother Morathi led the
kingdom of Nagarythe astray into worship of the Chaos
Gods, not all of their people followed. When Malekith led his
people in a rebellion against the rightful Phoenix King, those
who had not been converted to depravity remained loyal to
the throne of Ulthuan and waged a secret war, a war of
shadows, against the Witch King and his armies. When the
Witch King was defeated and forced to flee with his
followers, most of these ‘shadow warriors’ were killed,
drowned by the sea as their land was torn asunder by the
Witch King’s foul magics.
The people of Nagarythe that survived became a nation of
wanderers, moving from place to place and never really
welcomed by other High Elves, for these Shadow Elves as
they became known had gained a reputation for being a fierce
and warlike people, full of cruelty. This reputation, while
probably only partially true, sets the Shadow Elves apart
from other members of their race. This, along with their grim
attitude and generally dark presence, makes other High Elves
feel ill at ease around them. In Ulthuan they are misfits and
outcasts, and many of these proud people seek their fortunes
outside Ulthuan entirely. They truly are a race ‘in the
shadows’ between the cruel darkness of the Dark Elves, and
the beautiful light of the other High Elves.
Some of the Elves of Nagarythe have been driven mad by this
condition, but most have accepted their existence, and are
driven on by a desire for revenge against the arch nemesis the
Witch King and his perverse mother. The Shadow Elves form
themselves into warbands and travel the lands of Ulthuan and
the Known World, sometimes fighting Dark Elves (and other
forces of Chaos) when they find them, and fighting just to
survive the remainder of the time. Some still work in the
service of the Phoenix king, acting as scouts and trackers for
his armies. Sometimes small units of these warriors will be
sent by their king to distant lands on a special mission for
Ulthuan – recovery of ancient artefacts left behind when the
High Elves abandoned the Old World, or sabotage of a
rumoured plot of the Dark Elves. When sent on such a
mission, these bands bring their military trappings with them

- standards and war horns, unit insignia fiercely emblazoned
on their shields – for the Shadow Elves take pride in their
loyalty to the Phoenix King. Other warbands represent small
groups of warriors seeking their fortune... though still loyal to
Ulthuan, they may no longer feel welcome in their island
home, or perhaps they represent a family pursuing a personal
vendetta against a particular Dark Elf leader. Whatever the
case, bands of Shadow Warriors may occasionally be seen
roving the lands of the Old World to exploring the steamy
jungles of Lustria.
Due to their wandering nature, it’s not uncommon to see
Shadow Warriors travelling the lands of the Empire, so they
should fit right in your normal games of Mordheim.
However, the Empire is not the only land these tireless

warriors travel to in their quest to rid the world of Dark
Elves. As more settings are introduced for the game, you will
be able to take your Shadow Warriors to other lands, such as
the jungles of Lustria as introduced in Lustria Cities of Gold.
You should not feel constrained to keep the Shadow Warriors
in one city, it is their nature to wander.
##### Special Rules

Hate Dark Elves: All warriors in a Shadow Warrior
Warband (excluding any Hired Swords) have an unyielding
Hatred for Dark Elves.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Shadow Warrior Warband can
spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors
(i.e. twice their Initiative in inches).
Distaste for Poison: The use of poisons and various drugs is
a Dark Elf specialty. As such, it is frowned upon by Shadow
Warriors, even more so than by other High Elves. Warriors in
a Shadow Warrior Warband may not use poisons of any type.
Unforgiving: In addition to their hatred of their corrupt kin,
the folk of Nagarythe have a long history of struggle against
the forces of Chaos. In multiplayer games, a Shadow Warrior
warband may never forge an alliance with any Warband of a
Chaotic nature (Possessed, Skaven, Beastmen, Dark Elves,
etc.).
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Elves of Nagarythe have learned to stifle their distaste for
‘lesser races’, and have even been known to work alongside
them from time to time. A Shadow Warrior Warband may
hire any Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so
no Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Shadow Warrior Warband must include a minimum of 3
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. Maximum number of warriors in
the warband is 12.

starting a Shadow Warrior Warband.
##### Heroes

1 Shadow Master
70 Gold Crowns to hire
Shadow Master is a very honourable title among the warriors of the
Shadow Elves... it is given to one who has fought in the shadow war
for so long that he rules the darkness that he fights from. Often a
member of the former Nagarythe nobility, the captain of a Shadow
Warrior Warband is known by the honourable title ‘Shadow
Master’. These proud and strong-willed warriors often gather a
small band of their followers and seek a life away from the hesitant
charity and distasteful stares of Ulthuan.

0-3 Shadow Walker
45 Gold Crowns to hire
One step down from the title of Shadow Master is Shadow Walker. A
walker in the shadows is considered to have made friends with the
darkness, and while he does not command it, it gives him aid when
asked. Shadow Walkers are seasoned veterans in the war against
the Dark Elves. They are skilled trackers and hunters, and the most
trusted lieutenants of the Warband’s captain, the Shadow Master.

0-1 Shadow Weaver
55 Gold Crowns to hire
All High Elves have some aptitude for magic, and those with the
greatest aptitude are taught how to bend the Winds of Magic to their
will. Shadow Weavers are the mages of Nagarythe. Due to the
nature of their unending war against the Dark Elves, the mages of
Nagarythe tend to specialise in magics that use shadows to conceal
their presence and confound their enemies. In fact the title Shadow
Weaver comes from the nature of their magic... like a talented
tailor, the Shadow Weaver takes the threads of shadow and fashions
them into shapes and forms of his choosing.

#### Forest-Walker Warbands

Once elves were a common sight in the Old World. After the War of The Beard they decided to leave the Old World and travel
back to Ulthuan but some elves stayed back and settled in the big forests of Bretonnia. Most famous is the wood elf kingdom
of Athel Loren ruled by Orion and Ariel. But the wood elves do not only live in Athel Loren and there are small communities
in most of the large forests of the Empire. On the rare occasions that the Wood Elves willingly enter into discourse with other
races while in search of extremely rare herbs or to check the integrity of magical seals designed to keep intruders from finding
secrets best kept from the prying eyes of the lesser races. But, ever since the appearance event known among men as the
Hammer of Sigmar, (the twin-tailed comet) there have been an increasing number of disturbing rumours that there is a group of
Shadow Dryads in the blasphemous city of Mordheim. Are they the work of Cyanathair, do they belong to the fallen kin of
Coethil or is there a more sinister truth behind these rumours?

##### Forest of Athel Loren

The forest of Athel Loren is typically isolationists, they are
ruled by the demi-gods Orion and Ariel, the King and Queen
of the Woods. Ariel has great sorcerous power and wisdom
beyond mortal ken. With the falling of the comet known
among men as the Hammer of Sigmar, she felt the approach
of a great and evil power; a fallen Chaos lord cast out of the
dark Realms by the other Gods whom it had tried and failed
to destroy. Known to man as Malal, this evil power was now
incarnate on the physical plane and not subject to the
instability that keeps other powers of Chaos somewhat in
check. Ariel saw in her wisdom that the coming of the Lord
of Shadows to the Old World would be a harbinger of dark
times and the beginning of a blight upon the land. It was clear
to her that Malal must be destroyed early or he would grow in
power and spread his poison across the lands. By the time the
Shadowlord turned his eye to Athel Loren he would be too
powerful to stop. Therefore a call went out and the bravest
Wood Elves of the glades of Athel Loren volunteered to
make the dangerous journey across the lands of the men of
the Empire and search out the evil that is Malal and destroy
it.
Special rules
Recruitment: Wood Elves are fewer in number than most of
the other groups staking their claims in Mordheim. To
represent this, it is harder for them to recruit replacements
than other warbands. When a Wood Elven warband wishes to
employ new members, the gold coin cost is paid for all
reinforcements is paid, but the warriors don’t show up
immediately; the new recruits must make the journey from
Athel Loren to Mordheim. Therefore the entire group of
reinforcements will arrive after 1d3 games have passed.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from forest of
Athel Loren receive a bonus of +6 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Forest of Shadows

Before the twin-tailed comet devastated Mordheim the Forest
of Shadows was the home of a magnificent elven settlement
but with the fall of Mordheim horrible beasts and horrors
began to pour out of the city and infiltrate the forest
corrupting the sacred glades. The rumor of the magical
abilities of the Starstone (or wyrdstone as men named it)
spread and the wood elf mages believed that with this power
they could once more restore the balance of the forest and
save the sacred glades that had been corrupted. Thus it was
decided by the elders to send small bands of warriors to
Mordheim to retrieve shards of Starstone.
Special rules
Beast-Hunters: All the Forest-Walker warbands from the
Forest of Shadows Hate Beastmen.
Wardancers: Forest of Shadows warbands may not purchase
Waywatchers, but may instead take two Wardancers.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Forest of
Shadows receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Chaotic / Neutral
##### The Great Forest

It is Said that hidden deep inside the Great Forest of the
Empire, high amount the trees you might find the hidden
village of Wood Elves, they have been hiding ever sines the
War of The Beard. It is also said that some are from an
ancient city which was destroyed by the Dwarves. From the
ruins of this city, the now City of Mordheim stands. It is not
known why, but the Wood Elves of the Great Forest are on
the move. Maybe there is an ancient treasure hidden in the
old Elven Ruins or maybe something even Darker hidden
away down there!
Special rules
Waywatchers: Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest may have an addition Waywatcher, but would lose the
Wardancer.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.


##### Wood Elves Special Rules

Dark Enemies: Forest-Walker warbands may never ally with
Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (see the ‘Multiplayer
Rules for more details on warband alliances). If ally with any
Dwarven warbands (not Hired swords) then both parties will
count as having distrusted alliance even if both Parties have
the same alliance type.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Forest-Walker Warband can spot
Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors (i.e.
twice their Initiative in inches).
Forest Folks: The Wood Elves spend their entire lives in the
confines of their forest, to represent this all Wood Elves have
the following:
* Wood Elves gain a +1 to Leadership bonus, while in
woodland terrain. (This bonus will not take the
Leadership characteristic above 10)
* Wood Elves can move through woodland terrain without
penalty
* Wood Elves that deploy behind a tree or shrub (or similar
cover) may declare to be hidden from the start of the
battle.
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Wood Elves have learned to stifle their distaste for ‘lesser
races’, and have even been known to work alongside them
from time to time. A Forest-Walker Warband may hire any
Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so no
Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins) or Black power weapons. Also
Forest-Walker Warband will not hire any Dwarven Hired
Swords.
Wood Elf Archery: When using normal Longbows, an extra
6" range and an additional -1 Armor save. Therefore a
standard Longbow has a 36" range and-1 armor saves vs.
normal armor.
Forest Spirits: The following rules apply to all creatures
with the Forest Spirit special rule:
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Psychology.
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Poison.
* All Forest Spirits Cause Fear.
* All Forest Spirits do not gain experience.
* All Forest Spirits treat all stunned as knock down.

#### Witch Hunters

The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as
the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the
eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers,
fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods,
deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of
profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting
music. Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the
suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception
of other Witch Hunters.
It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its
forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death
by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy.
Many of the Witch Hunters’ victims treacherously avoid their
fate by perishing under torture before making a full
confession. In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are
kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The
most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the
Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon
worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the
name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they
are the most abhorrent!
The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters
with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of
events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s
punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters
rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has
been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s
holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of
the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded the
Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the
wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also pits them
into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters
of Sigmar – those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-
heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty
of Sigmar.
Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon
turn a crowd to their own ends. They are universally dreaded,
for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are
countless individuals who would willingly and
enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a

Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch
Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens,
Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the
huge vicious war hounds which the Witch Hunters employ to
track and bring down fugitives.
As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-
armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and
headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly
curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them
of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so
that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.
The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that
accompany them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight
indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or
surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their
reason as well.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Zealots
20 gold crowns to hire
When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is
often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering
pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge
their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots.
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy
evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been
peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in
a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in
their ranks, and many a band of Zealots is led by Witch Hunters.

their huge jaws and powerful bite, they are perfect for hunting down
(and tearing apart) any heretics, mutants, deviants and witches.

0-5 Flagellants
40 gold crowns to hire
Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the
world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the
ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane
persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire,
preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing
speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to
fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread.
Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat, for
they have the strength of madmen, and their bodies have become
inured to pain because of self-mutilation.

an Advance roll which would otherwise allow them to do so.
Special Rules
Fanatical: Flagellants are convinced that the end of the
world is nigh, and nothing in this world holds any terror for
them. Flagellants automatically pass all Leadership-based
tests they are required to take. A Flagellant may never
become a warband leader.


#### Sisters of Sigmar

For centuries the nobility of the Empire has sent its wayward
or troublesome daughters to the Holy Convent of the Order of
Merciful Sisters of Sigmar in Mordheim to be initiated into
the only order of priestesses dedicated to the Empire’s patron
god. The Sisters of Sigmar, as they are commonly called,
have traditionally travelled the Empire administering to the
sick and poor, tending to the needs of orphans, curing the
diseased and mending broken bodies. As well as the healing
arts, which they practise with expert knowledge of herb-lore
and prayer, their advice is frequently sought by those about to
make an important decision, for the Sisters of Sigmar are
famed for their ability to predict the fickle course of fate.
Though once much loved by the common people, the Sisters
have seen their popularity wane in recent years. Rabble-
rousing Witch Hunters have denounced them as witches and
heretics, so that even in the countryside they are attacked and
driven away by the very peasants they seek to help. Many of
Sigmar’s priests wish to disband the order altogether,
claiming that women have no right to teach the holy word of
Sigmar. Even the Grand Theogonist, ostensibly the chief
authority over the order, has cooled towards the sisterhood,
denying the throne to Magritta of Marienburg who was
brought up by the Sisters and said to be sympathetic to their
cause. These days the Sisters of Sigmar have retreated to their
convent situated high on the craggy island of Sigmar’s Rock
in the river Stir in Mordheim.
Of all the inhabitants of Mordheim only the Sisters of Sigmar
were prepared for its destruction. Seeress Cassandora foretold
of the disaster and at their nightly vigil the Maidens of
Sigmar heard the voice of Sigmar speaking in their dreaming
minds. Thus they knew that they would be safe in their
fortress high above the city, raised as it is above the polluted
vapours, if only they were prepared to survive the fire of
Sigmar’s Fury.
While the rest of Mordheim fell under a spell of madness the
Sisters of Sigmar offered prayer after prayer, scourging
themselves to drive out all thoughts of sin, fervently
accepting a punishing penitential regime to harden their
minds against the wantonness running rampant outside their
walls. When the blow finally came the Sisters gathered
beneath the great temple dome of their convent which, well

built and fortified as it was by the prayers of the Sisters,
protected them from the fire and heat of their master’s ire.
The Sisters believe they have a holy mission, a task that they
have been set by Sigmar himself and to which they must
submit themselves body and soul. Their sacred duty is to
gather up the shards of wyrdstone and hide it deep beneath
Sigmar’s Rock in the vaults of their convent where, shielded
by a great depth of solid granite and guarded by the eternal
prayers of the sisterhood, it will cause no harm to Sigmar’s
people. It is a nigh hopeless task, for there are few Sisters and
countless shards of stone. Worse still, there are many who
want the stone for themselves, to take it from Mordheim and
spread its contagion amongst the cities of the Empire.
The warbands of the sisterhood are led by tough Matriarchs,
each accompanied by a body of warrior sisters. The training
and harsh discipline of the convent includes mastery of
martial as well as ecclesiastic skills, for mastery of the body
is but the first step towards the mastery of the soul. Their
favoured weapon is the warhammer, the instrument of
Sigmar, seen as his holy symbol, alongside the twin-tailed
comet.

#### Bretonnia Crusades

By Sir Tomaso De Merrigan
This is a time when the Empire is being torn apart from
within. A time when there is no Emperor and the lands are
increasingly divided, as individual cities look to their own
lords and mercantile Burgomeisters gain in power through
gold. Where corruption flows like effluent down the River
Reik and conspiracy is rife throughout the land. By contrast,
happy is the land of Bretonnia where chivalry reigns, honour
is upheld and the Lady of the Lake still bestows her favour on
those deemed worthy. To the knights of Bretonnia Mordheim
is a vile place where virtue and order have been discarded.
Where a proud city once stood nightmarish creatures now
wander the streets and mix with men in dens of corruption
and squalor. It is therefore considered extremely virtuous for
a knight to embark on a spiritual quest to Mordheim, seeking
to achieve honour in battle and perhaps earn the favour of the
Lady of the Lake herself. In Mordheim a knight’s courage
and valour will be thoroughly tested, but so much the better,
because with hardship come honour.
A Questing Knight will relinquish his castle and domain to
set out on such a journey. He becomes free from any
obligation to defend a domain and will now seek a road
leading to new adventures. A Questing Knight has put all
worldly ambitions aside and is accorded a rank far greater
then even the most powerful dukes of the land. Such a
gesture is considered particularly noble, and it is not
uncommon for other knights and common folk to flock to the
Questing Knights aid. Knights Errant in particular are eager
for adventure and a chance to win honour by a feat of arms,
so will often join a Questing Knight on his journey. By the
time the Questing Knight leaves the fair lands of Bretonnia
he will have a sizable retinue following him, ready to fight
for the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake.
Once on a quest a Knight will be spurred on by dreams and
visions often visited upon him by the Lady of the Lake. This
leads him ever onwards and inspires and encourages him on
his quest. In time he hopes that through his deeds and valour
he will earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake and she will
let him drink from the Grail of Life. This is the final reward
for a knight, and on finding the Grail he will return to
Bretonnia to protect its people. Until that time though, he is
bound to fight the enemies of virtue and order and to endure
incalculable hardships.

##### Special Rules

Before heading into battle Bretonnian Knights kneel and pray
to the Lady of the Lake, avowing to fight to the death for
honour and justice. Before playing a game of Mordheim
make a Leadership test against the Leadership characteristic
of the warbands leader. If the test is successful the Lady of
the Lake has bestowed her blessing on the warband. The
blessing takes the form of a powerful curse upon the enemies
of chivalry, and in particular upon those that make use of the
foul and dishonourable weapons of mass destruction. Any
model in the opposing warband who wishes to fire a black
powder weapon must roll a D6 and score 4+ to overcome the
curse, otherwise they may not fire the weapon. The opposing
player must test each time they wish to fire such a weapon.
Models armed with other shooting weapons, such as bows
and crossbows, do not have to test unless they dare raise their
weapons against the gallant Knights of Bretonnia. If any
enemy model wishes to shoot at a Bretonnian Knight
(Questing Knights and Errants only), then they must first roll
a 4+ on a D6 to overcome the curse.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Questing Knight’s warband must include a minimum of
three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your
initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the
warband may never exceed 12.
Questing Knight: Each Questing Knight’s warband must
have one Questing Knight: no more, no less!
Knight Errant: Your warband may include up to two Knight
Errant.

may not have more squires in the warband then you have
Knights.
Men-at-arms: Your warband may include any number of
Men-at-Arms.
Bowmen: Your warband may include any number of
Bowmen.

#### Kislevite Warband

The land of Kislev lies to the north and east of the Empire.
The further east one travels the dense forests give way to
open steppes stretching to the foothills of the Worlds Edge
Mountains. The winters of Kislev are harsh and cruelly long
and for months the land is gripped by snow blizzards and ice.
The townships of Kislev are mainly built of timber for stone
is rare and only the most important of the cities have stone
buildings and walls. In the ancient capital city of Kislev the
massive white buildings are topped by vast gilded domes and
decorated with golden statues and gargoyles. It has been said
that Kislev is a poor country filled with rich people. It is
certainly true that the people that live in this beleaguered land
have an outlook on life that strangers often find surprisingly
positive. For Kislev is a country under constant threat of
invasion. Armies of savage Norse often venture into Kislev,
raiding and pillaging, and to make matters worse Kislev lies
right on the border of the Chaos Wastes, so that any Chaos
incursion passes through the land (and its people) first.
To aid them in their struggle against these murderous foes,
the Tzars of Kislev have forged strong ties with the Empire.
This alliance benefits both countries, as the rulers of the
Empire have long understood the benefit of a northern
bulwark against the tides of Chaos. Both countries have a
tradition of sending troops to aid the other in times of need,
and in fact the Gryphon Legion, pride of the Kislevite
nobility, was formed as a symbol of the unity between the
two countries. This knightly order is made up entirely of
Kislevite nobles, but is garrisoned and trained in the Empire.
Despite the constant threat of invading armies, the people of
Kislev sing and dance and play as much as or perhaps more
than the people of any other country in the Old World. Some
say that their relative happiness derives from their love of
strong drink. Whether this is true or not, Kislevites certainly
do enjoy their spirits, and in fact many of their people
attribute almost magical qualities to that most famous of
Kislevite drinks – vodka.
A Kislevite warband represents a group of individuals from
this unique northern realm. Kislevites tend to be quiet in the
face of strangers, but they hold much joy in their hearts. In
fact they are loud and boisterous when amongst their own
people. Kislevites are known to be extremely brave warriors,
and they hold a loathing for Chaos that is much stronger than
most of the peoples of the Old World. While many citizens of

the Empire may remain ignorant to the initial signs of a
Chaos cult, Kislevite citizens will immediately seek out any
signs of depravity and cleanse the infected individuals with
sword and flame. Keep these things in mind when you play a
Kislev warband. Most citizens of Kislev have lost homes or
loved ones to the warriors of Chaos, and they realise that
anything less than constant vigilance could lead to their
downfall. They are therefore unrelenting in their resolve
against their ancient enemies. Give the forces of Chaos no
quarter, and expect none in return.
##### Special Rules

Skills: The Druzhina Captain may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Academic, Strength & Speed when he gains a new
skill.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Druzhina Captain may
use his Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.

Inheritance: When the Kislevite warband is first created, the
Druzhina Captain is allowed to purchase one item from the
Kislevite Warrior equipment list at half the normal cost. This
item represents a treasured family heirloom that has been
passed down through the generations. Losing an ancestral
item is considered very disrespectful and if the item is ever
lost (e.g. from a Robbed result on the Serious Injury chart),
the Captain MUST replace it with a finely-made substitute as
quickly as possible or risk being haunted by the angry spirits
of his ancestors. To replace an ancestral item, the Captain
must purchase the same item of equipment at 150% of its
normal price. This higher cost represents the fine detail and
valuable materials used in the item’s manufacture. Until the
item is replaced, the Captain suffers a -1 penalty to all tests
and rolls to hit.
 
0-1 Esaul
35 gold crowns to hire
Esaul is an ancient Cossack term that means ‘Best Warrior’, and
was traditionally given to the most powerful fighter in the tribe. The
word has survived the generations, and today it is an honorary title
given by a chieftain to his personal champion, though it is also used
by Gospodar warriors as a more familiar term for an experienced
veteran. Most Kislevite cities contain at least one grizzled veteran
amongst the ranks of their professional soldiery who has been
affectionately labelled ‘Esaul’ by his men.

0-1 Bear Tamer
35 gold crowns to hire
Since ancient times, bears have featured in Kislevite myths and
legends. Kislevites have a deep respect for these mighty beasts, and
gather to see the trained specimens that accompany travelling
circuses. The powerful men that train these bears are known simply
as Bear Tamers, and the best of them are widely renowned amongst
the people of Kislev. Bears can be trained for martial purposes as
well, and Bear Tamers are often recruited into the armies of Kislev,
where they enjoy a special status among the soldiery.

Skills: The Bear Tamer may choose from Combat, Strength

Special Rules
Bear Handler: A Kislevite Warband that includes a Bear
Tamer is allowed to purchase a Bear as a henchman. This
bear has been trained to follow the Tamer’s commands, and
so will automatically pass its Stupidity tests when within 6"
of the Bear Tamer (even if the Tamer is _incapacitated_).

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Warriors
25 gold crowns to hire
The Gospodar tribe make up the bulk of the people of Kislev, and
they are generally considered the most civilised of the peoples of
this harsh realm. Gospodars are people of large stature with blonde
or red hair. Their women are well known throughout the Old World
for their fair-skinned beauty. Gospodar women have the same rights
as men, and are allowed to rise to positions of power; in fact the
most powerful of the legendary Ice Mages of Kislev are all female!

Cossacks
30 gold crowns to hire
Cossacks are nomadic tribesmen who live in the far north of Kislev.
They are always the first to encounter any Chaos invaders from the
north, and so have long fostered a bitter enmity with the servants of
Chaos. Cossacks are renowned for their riding skills, and their
favoured weapons are the scimitar (sword) and spear.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: Cossacks may be armed with weapons

Special Rules
Hate Chaos: Years of bitter struggle against the forces of
Chaos have left their mark on the Cossack people. Cossacks
are subject to Hatred against all forces of Chaos (e.g.
members of any warband the players would apply the
Ancient Enemies special rule to).

0-3 Streltsi
25 gold crowns to hire
Firearms were first introduced to Kislev by Prince Boydinov of
Erengrad. Though very popular among his people, the prince was
considered quite eccentric (it was he that invented the mad game
called Kislevite Roulette). Despite initial superstition as time past
handguns have been accepted as essential weapons of war. In his
legacy the prince had a large portion of his wealth set aside for the
establishment and upkeep of a regiment of handgunners. The
regiment continues to this day and its members are known as
Streltsi. Soldiers from other cities in Kislev, most notably the
capital, are sent here to train in the use of firearms with the Streltsi.
In addition to their knowledge of handguns Streltsi are also trained
to use a small halberd called the berdiche. In fact the berdiche and
handgun are the most widely recognised symbols of the Streltsi. In
combat Streltsi are able to use their berdiches as rests for their
handguns, increasing their accuracy and making for a deadly
weapon combination.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
Weapons/Armor: Streltsi may be armed with weapons and
armor chosen from the Streltsi equipment list. Note that
Streltsi are the only Kislevite Warriors trained in the use of
handguns.
Special Rules
Gun-Rest: A Streltsi warrior armed with both halberd and
handgun may use the halberd as a gun-rest. The warrior
receives a +1 on his ‘to hit’ roll with the handgun, as long as
he did not move that turn (this applies even if the warrior has
a skill that allows him to move and shoot with his handgun –
he must not move if he is to rest the gun).


0-1 Trained Bear
145 gold crowns to hire
Bear Tamers often bring one of their sacred bears with them when
they prepare to enter battle. These great beasts respect little, and it
takes years for a human to win their trust and obedience. The effort
to train one of these creatures is well worth it however, as one
cannot hope for a more loyal friend or useful ally when things turn
bad.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

6 3 0 5 5 3 2 2 6
Weapons/Armor: None, other than their claws and teeth!
Special Rules
Trained: A bear doesn’t care about the warband’s mission or
enmity for other warbands – it’s just following the orders of
its trainer. Sometimes it gets bored waiting for orders; for this
reason Trained Bears are subject to the rules for Stupidity. If
given ‘special attention’ by its trainer, it will mind a bit
better, so a bear is not required to take these Stupidity tests if
the warband’s Bear Tamer is within 6". In fact this is the only
member of the warband the bear will listen to; a Trained Bear
will never use the warband leader’s Leadership for any tests
it is required to take. It may use the Bear Tamer’s leadership
if within 6" of him however. Note that the warband cannot
control the bear without a Bear Tamer. The Trained Bear may
not be used in any game in which the warband's Bear Tamer
does not take part (and this means that if the warband does

not include a Bear Tamer at all, the warband must keep the
bear staked back at camp until they hire a new one!).
Fearsome: A charging bear is a very scary sight indeed! A
Trained Bear causes Fear.
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armor save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Fiercely Loyal: Such dedication is built into the relationship
between Bear Tamer and bear that if his trainer is injured, a
bear will often stand over the body to protect it, or even drag
the trainer’s body to safety. As long as his bear is not taken
Out of Action during a game, a Bear Tamer ignores the
following results on the Serious Injury table: ‘Sold to the
Pits’, ‘Robbed’, and ‘Captured’ (and ignore equivalent results
in settings such as Lustria that have their own special Serious
Injury table). If any of these results are rolled for the Bear
Tamer, treat the result as a ‘Full Recovery’ instead.
Animal: Trained Bears are animals and do not gain
experience.


#### Dwarf Treasure Hunters

Dwarfs are a grim and exceptionally proud people. They respect three things above all else: age, wealth and skill. It is no
surprise then that these grim warriors can be found in Mordheim searching for fame and fortune. Mark Havener gives full
rules for including Dwarf warbands in Mordheim.
Occasionally, a Dwarf noble will find himself in desperate
times. His family hold may have been overrun by Goblins or
Skaven, or he may have somehow disgraced himself and
been banished. Other Dwarfs know these warriors as the
Dispossessed. Dwarfs are a proud race and it is against a
Dwarf ’s nature to lose himself in despair. Instead, a noble
who finds himself in such dire straits will gather together a
group of his closest friends and kin and go treasure hunting,
hoping to accumulate a large enough hoard to establish his
own holding. At this time, the largest source of wealth in the
Known World is rumoured to be a city in the Empire. The
city is known as Mordheim...

##### Special Rules

All Dwarfs are subject to the following special rules:
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Armor: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armor.
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for supremacy
in the Old World. A Dwarf warband may never include any
kind of Elven Hired Sword or Dramatis Personae.
Incomparable Miners: Dwarfs spend much of their lives
underground searching for precious minerals, and they are the
best in the world at this kind of work. In the city of
Mordheim they apply similar skills to the search for
wyrdstone. When checking for wyrdstone at the end of a
game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf
warband.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral

##### Choice of warriors

A Dwarf warband must include a minimum of 3 models. You
have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and equip
your warband. The maximum number of warriors in the
warband is 12.
Noble: Each Dwarf warband must have one Noble – no
more, no less!
Engineer: Your warband may include up to 1 Engineer.
Troll Slayers: Your warband may include up to 2 Troll
Slayers.

of the weapon by 3. For rules on Gromril weapons see the
Mordheim rulebook. Note that this price is only for a starting
warband, as it represents the Dwarfs outfitting themselves at
their own stronghold. Later purchases of Gromril weapons
are done using the price chart in the Mordheim rules.
**The price of a suit of Gromril armor is cheaper for a
starting warband to represent the relative ease with which
Dwarfs can find such items in their own stronghold. Later
purchases of Gromril armor must be done using the normal
price chart in the Mordheim rules.
##### Heroes

for Crossbows and Handguns. Any range increases are only
maintained as long as the Dwarf Engineer remains with the
warband.


0-2 Dwarf Troll Slayers
50 gold crowns to hire
Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult obsessed with
seeking an honourable death in combat. Having committed some
unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in some way, a Dwarf will

psychopathic and violent. There are however few better fighters in

hunters.

#### Von Carstein Warband

Count Vlad von Carstein and his wife Isabella have ruled the
province of Sylvania for as long as anyone can remember –
peasants whisper of some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile
them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their court. Indeed,
Sylvania has the most dire reputation of all the provinces of
the Empire. Few men sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania
have ever returned from those dark Sylvanian forests, and then
rarely with their sanity intact.
In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a throne
of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the ruler of Sylvania.
He waits in shadows, having set himself apart from the politics
and bickering of the Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he,
and all the ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave. Here he patiently
waits, drinking the blood of maidens from gold goblets.
For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength and
mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day soon he will
march from the forests of Sylvania at the head of an army of
restless dead. The pieces of magic stone that lie scattered
among the ruins of Mordheim can give the Count the power to
challenge the nobles of the Empire and enslave the men of the
Old World.
Wyrdstone holds enough captured magical energy to unleash a
great spell of doom to rival that of Nagash the Black. If the
Count is successful, he will raise all the dead between the
Worlds Edge Mountains and the borders of Stirland, and go to
war against the divided rulers of the Empire. His plans laid
out, Vlad sends his thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his
bidding.
During dark, moonless nights, black coaches arrive at the
gates of Mordheim carrying coffins. Ghouls scuttle from their
hiding places to greet them, and corpses are stirred by a
command which the living cannot hear. Following the
commands of the Vampire, they hunt for shards of wyrdstone.
The night belongs to the Undead, and in Mordheim it is
always night.

##### Special Rules

Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Master (or
Mistresses) and their undead minions. The human members of
a Von Carstein warband are immune to fear caused by types of
undead in their own warband, ie: skeletons, wights, vampires,
etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
##### Choice of warriors

An Undead warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your warband. The
maximum number of warriors in the warband may never
exceed 15.
Vampire: Each Undead warband must have one Vampire: no
more, no less!
Necromancer: Your warband may include a single
Necromancer if you wish.
Dregs: Your warband may include up to three Dregs.
Zombies: Your warband may include any number of
Zombies.
Ghouls: Your warband may include any number of Ghouls.

Necromancers are evil wizards, studying the corrupt art of
Necromancy. Many of them are acolytes and servants of Vlad von

0-3 Dregs
20 gold crowns to hire
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of the demise of
Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals, shunned
even by the other men and women who still live in the ruins and
catacombs of the city.
Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with
surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to
their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve
them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to buy
equipment, weapons and supplies from the settlements around
Mordheim which would often not welcome Necromancers or where
Vampires would fall under the suspicion of the Witch Hunters. They
can also do the bidding of their vampiric master during daylight,
when the Vampires must rest in their coffins.

The Undead Troll is a construct created by a necromancer using
both Dark magic and arcane science. The Necromancer then applies
his knowledge of science and magic to bring this creature to a state

fair amount of maintenance, so the Necromancer may only maintain
one Undead Troll at a time.

Ghouls
40 gold crowns to hire
Ghouls are the descendants of evil and insane men who ate the flesh
of the dead. When the lean and hungry times of famine come upon
the Old World, the most depraved and destitute took to feasting on
corpses to survive.
Driven by their unspeakable craving for the meat of their fellow
men, these creatures have given up their human life and dwell near
graveyards, crypts and tombs, digging up the rotting corpses of the
recently buried and consuming the cold flesh with their bare teeth
and claws.
The destruction of Mordheim attracted many Ghoul clans from the
north, and now they have taken up permanent residence in the
crypts and cemeteries of the ruined city.

##### Heroes

1 Blood Dragon Knight
110 gold crowns to hire
Vampires of the Blood dragons are all descendants of Abhorash and
belong to the most capable warriors in the Old World. They use
their Vampiric abilities to become superior fighters, always seeking
new challenges. Most of them are members of the Order of the
Dragon-Templars, an ancient knightly order based in the Empire or
other unholy Orders. Unlike their von Carstein cousins, they have
not much love for Magic and intrigues. They prefer using their
combat abilities rather than using dark magic.

Wights are long dead heroes who are tied to the land of the living by
magic. In ages past, the men of the Old World buried their dead
beneath mounds of earth and stone, together with their battle gear
and worldly wealth. Although their bodies have decayed, Wights are
held together by evil magic so strong that it can last for many
centuries. They wear ancient armor of bronze and black iron,
corroded by time and dusty with the years. They carry iron weapons
inlaid with evil runes, an accursed parody of once powerful magical
blades. Some Vampires rule over entire regiments of Wights,
warriors who dared challenge them in life and now serve them in
death.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Skeleton Warriors
20 gold crowns to hire
The battlefields of the Old World are strewn with the graves of many
nameless warriors who have fallen in combat and been consigned to
a hasty resting place, or left upon the ground amidst the carnage.
Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be
summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that
these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint
memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the
compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they
were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is
confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid
when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching
towards him?

#### Lahmian Warband

Long ago, the nobles of Lahmia stole the secret of the elixir of eternal life from the Great Necromancer, Nagash, during the
war in which he was expelled from the land of Nehekhara. Over time, corrupted by the secret they had stolen, they became the
first true vampires and were themselves driven out. Banished from their ancestral home, the Lahmians became mistresses of
seduction and cunning, indulging their hedonistic appetites through manipulation of lesser wills. Of all the great vampire
bloodlines, the Lahmians above all have become most adept at exploiting that great weakness of humanity, the desire for love,
power and an escape from death. Their poor, deluded followers do their bidding by night and protect them by day. Their
interest in humanity (if interest is the right word to use of what are, after all, merely instruments and playthings) has made
them strong. Now, centuries after they were dispossessed, Nehekhara is once again a land of the dead, and the Lahmian
vampires have returned from the Northlands to reclaim their own. In the North, they have learned how to bend humans to their
will. In their ancestral home they have older, more faithful servants who, dormant through the centuries, have awaited their
return.

##### Special Rules

Blood Successor: Unlike the Vampire warband, Lahmia
warbands may not recruit a new vampire if the warband
contains a Blood Sister. Instead, if the Lahmia is slain then
the Blood Sister may transform into a Vampire during the
post-battle experience phase. Until that happens the surviving
human henchmen with highest leadership (or, in the case of a
tie, the most experience) will assume leadership of the
warband until the Blood Sister transforms. If the warband
does not contain a Blood Sister then leadership is allocated as
above and a new vampire may be recruited after the next
battle. If during the post-battle phase the warband contains
neither a vampire nor a necromancer either because they have
been killed or never recruited, then any skeletons and wight
henchmen in the warband are lost as the magic which
sustains them is dispelled.
Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Mistresses
and their undead minions. The human members of an Lahmia
warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in
their own warband, i.e: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc.
Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Lahmian warband must consist of at least three models.
You have 500gc to recruit and equip your initial warband.
The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never
exceed 15.
Lahmia Vampire: Each Lahmian Warband must have one
Lahmia Vampire no more, no less!
Necromancer: Your warband may have up to one
Necromancer.
Thrall: Your warband may have up to three Thrall.
Blood Sister: Your warband may include up to one Blood

Skeletons: Your warband may include any number of
Skeletons.
Blood Slaves: Your warband may have up to five Blood

Wolves.

Devoted: The Thralls is completely enraptured by the

stunned or knocked down result on the injuries chart) the
Thralls will become frenzied and immediately take the most
direct route to her aid, attacking any model within 2" either
side of a direct line to the Lahmia. If the vampire is taken out
of action, the Beloved will immediately hate the model who
did the damage and attempt to kill them at the earliest
opportunity. The beloved will remain frenzied until the hated
enemy is slain.
Favoured: If the Lahmia's Beloved is killed, she may choose
one of her Thralls to replace him by granting him the Blood
Kiss at his next advance. If this option is taken the Thralls'
leadership is increased to 8 if not already so and he takes the
place of the Beloved in the warband's roster. The Thrall's
elevation to Beloved counts instead of any advance he may
be entitled to. A new Thrall may be recruited after the
warband's next battle.


0-1 Blood Sister

Lahmian vampires are solitary creatures, but the preservation of the
bloodline is a priority for them. Young maidens are carefully

should be destroyed. These girls stand on the boundary of life and
death. Not fully undead, but no longer wholly human...

Special Rules:
Hardened: Blood Sisters are accustomed to the ways of
undead. Hence they are immune to fear and never test for
being all alone.
Demi-Vampires: If the warband's Lahmia is killed, the
Blood Sister may take her place. At her next advance she will
become a vampire on a roll of 4+ on a d6. This counts instead
of the advance. The blood Sister retains her existing skills
and experience but the usual rules for undead apply
immediately and her maximum stats become those of a
vampire. If the Blood Sister fails to transform, roll again at
her next and all subsequent advances. Once a Blood Sister
has become a vampire a new Blood Sister may be recruited
into the warband after the next game.

0-1 Beloved
Lahmians are attracted to mortals of strong will and strong body.
Their seduction gives the vampires a special pleasure, and their
martial skills are evermore devoted to the will of their dark mistress.
Until, that is, she grows tired of them or finds a more interesting
lover...
Beloved: The Beloved maybe chosen from any hero in a
human warband other then Middenheim, Witch Hunters,
Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed, Carnival of Chaos and any hero
that uses prays. The Beloved will keep the same cost, profile,
skill list, special rules and starting Experience. Weapons &
Armor will be chosen from his Wargear list and the skill
leader is lost, as if hired by his normal warband.
Special Rules:

#### Tilean Warband

The land of Tilea is home to some of the most wealthy and
aloof people in the Old World. A land that is divided by its
own competition of trade and separated by personal feuds and
warring city-states. It is civic pride and a desire for financial
status that drives each and every Tilean. To this end, the
Tileans have become proficient sailors and explorers. They
set sail for all ports in the Old World and drop anchor off the
shores of far distant lands in search of gold and precious
artefacts that can often bring a hefty price in any market of
the world.
Tilean warbands are often hired to explore the steamy
jungles, hot deserts or even the ruined city like Mordheim
either by their patron city-state or by wealthy merchants or
guilds. There are many city-states in Tilea to base a
warband’s history on although only the most prominent three
will be dealt with here. You can create a pirate warband
hailing from Sartosa or a warband of acolytes of the patron
god Lucan from Luccini if you so desire. Whatever warband
suites your fancy you’ll find that the land of Tilea is rich with
history to base it upon. You’ll also find a Tilean warband to
be structured much like the mercenary warbands but there are
subtle differences that reflect the rich Tilean history.

##### Miragleans

The Miragleans are deadly accurate with the city’s official
weapon, the crossbow. Therefore Miraglean Heroes have a
+1 to hit when using crossbows only. Marksmen get a +1 to
hit with any missile weapon they use (this is included in the
marksmen’s profile). All Miragleans have a deep-seated
hatred toward Skaven. This dates back to the red pox
outbreak of 1812 when three quarters of the population of the
city perished. When fighting Skaven a Miraglean warband
will be affected by the rules for Hatred towards them. Hired
swords are not affected by the Hatred rule.
Hired Swords: Miragleans warband cannot have Skaven
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Remasens

In 1487 a fleet of Dark Elf warships invaded the coastal city
of Remas and ever since the people of that city have a deep
dislike of the Druchii. A warband from Remas will fight to
the death against any Dark Elf warband they encounter. To
represent this, the Remasen player is allowed to re-roll any
rout test one time and must abide by the second roll. This
only applies when fighting Dark Elves. Remasen officers are
steadfast individuals whose years of training have afforded
them excellent leadership. The leadership value of a Remasen
captain, champion and young blood are always one point
higher regardless of whom they are fighting.
Hired Swords: Remasens warband cannot have Dark Elf
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Trantios

A warband hailing from Trantio will be the best-equipped
and most experienced human warband in Lustria. To
represent this a Trantio war band will always start a one-off
match with an extra 100 GC and in a Lustrian campaign they
will start with an extra 20% GC added to their total.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

Your warband must include a minimum of 3 models to a
maximum of 15 models. You have 500 points to assemble
your warband with. The maximum characteristics for each
type will be the same as any Mordheim mercenary warband.
Captain: Each Tilean Warband must have one Captain to
lead it – no more, no less.
Champion: Your Warband may include up to two
Champions.

#### Outlaw Warband

To the north of the River Stir lies the Great Forest, a vast
expanse of woodland that fills the very heart of the Empire.
Bounded along its southern edge by the river, this, the largest
forest of the known world, extends league upon league as far
as any man can see. Just at its southernmost, the River Stir
separates a small part of the forest from the main bulk of the
woodland and this smaller area of forest is known locally as
Stirwood. Small though Stirwood may be – indeed, this part
of the forest is not even on the same scale as the sacred Forest
of Loren, but, as many say, size isn’t everything – Stirwood
Forest is nevertheless still large enough to get lost in, and
many have done so, some by accident and some by design.
Stirwood lies just north of the noble city of Nuln and to the
west of Wurtbad, where law and order are strictly enforced,
at least they are strictly enforced once the City Guards have
finally managed to catch up with those who break the
Count’s law. The Elector Count of Stirland was well known
as a man that one should not cross. Those that did so were
inevitably declared as ‘outlaws’ and were pursued from the
cities. Even the most petty of criminals, some still quite
young, could be declared ‘outlaw’ and had little option but to
flee to the countryside. Many perished, both young and old,
but some made it to Stirwood where they could lay low.
During their time in Stirwood, some would band together and
become groups of outlaws, rather than just attempting to
survive on their own. The forest was a perfect training ground
to develop their skills, particularly in archery, where even the
hunting of the wild deer, the Count’s deer, was a crime in
itself. Illicit deer-hunting was not their only past-time as
many an unwary traveller, passing unsuspectingly through
the forest, would find themselves ambushed and relieved of
their goods.
Monks also lived in these parts, holy men who spent their
time in devotion to the blessed Sigmar. Usually they dwelt
alone in contemplation, but were often trusted by the local
groups of outlaws that they came into contact with and
attended to their spiritual needs, and, when the occasion
arose, also attended to their wounds.

In the years that followed the sighting of the twin-tailed star
in the sky, it was inevitable that tales of Mordheim would
have travelled down the waters of the River Stir. Tales of
strange sights and great riches would easily have reached the
inhabitants of Stirwood Forest. Temptations of this enormous
wealth that was rumoured to be in the shattered city would
have been hard for any group of outlaws to resist.
##### Special Rules

All warriors in an Outlaws warband may be equipped with
only one missile weapon at any time. All warriors must carry
a type of bow, but not crossbows, as part of their equipment.
So, even if an Outlaw acquires skills that allow him to use
additional ballistic weaponry, he cannot do so. The only
exception to this is the Monk who may choose to carry a
bow, but is not compelled to do so.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral.

contemplation of his devotion to Sigmar. However, some will see

activities of groups of outlaws. Their knowledge of healing is often
valued by other members.

#### Pit Fighter Warband

All across the world you can find gladiatorial pit fights, here
you can find hardy fighters taking up arms against each other.
From the vicious pits of Cutthroat’s Haven to the Black Pits
surrounding Mordheim there can be heard the clash of steel.
In most places local law itself bans these fights, but the
culture itself remains a haven for ex-mercenaries, escaped
convicts and itinerant conmen and bribes to local officials
ensures that this brutal sport continues unabated.
There are as many different type of fight as there are venues,
from small fistfights in an old barn or a back alley to huge
conflicts with many heavily armed combatants. Most fighters
are slaves who work for the so-called ‘circuit’. They try to
earn their freedom by paying off their owners with a large cut
of the winnings. Most successful Pit Fighters live for the
sport (and of course often die for it also!) because they know
of little else.
The men in this Warband consist solely of professional Pit
Fighters who were either able to buy their freedom or have
escaped. Now they roam the streets of Mordheim in search
for the Wyrdstone that would bring them wealth faster than
anyone can imagine.
The Pit Fighters are used to fighting in streets and small
corridors and this makes them a much-feared opponent. The
Pit King is the most skilled and cunning Pit Fighter of them
all who leads his band with an iron fist.
Appearance: Pit Fighters are grizzled veteran warriors
covered with many scars of battle, they are armed with
special Pit Weapons and Armor, their bodies well developed
and muscular. They wear little clothing and only partial
armor known as Pit Armor.

##### Special Rules

All Pit Fighters have the Pit Fighter skill as described in the
Strength Skill List except the Pit Fighter Initiates. (Pit Fighter
Skill: +1 WS, +1 A when fighting in ruins, buildings and The
Pit.)
Free the Slaves!: Pit Fighters hate all Slavers. The Pit
Fighters will never sell their captured opponents to the
slavers.
In the Pit!: Pit Fighters who capture an opponent may decide
to let him fight in the infamous fighting pits of Cutthroat’s
Haven.
The Pit Fighter Warband may decide to send in one or more
of their own fighters to fight the captive, if the Pit Fighter
wins he gains +2 Experience, the Warband gets all the
Captive’s armor and weapons +50gc, if the Pit Fighter loses
then roll to see whether he is dead or injured as normal
(ignore all following results: Robbed, Captured, Hardened,
Sold to the Pits and Survives Against the Odds), he will not
lose his armor or weapons, the Captive will get the 50 GC
and the +2 Experience when he wins. If the Captive wins the
audience decides whether he gains his freedom. Roll a D6 on
a 4+ the audience raise their thumbs and he is free. A 1-3
means he remains the Pit Fighters Captive and may be fielded
in the pits after future games
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

psychopathic and violent. There are, however, few better fighters in
the Known World, so which place would be more fitting for them
than the dangerous fighting pits then! Battling against the most

Hard Head: Dwarfs ignores the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for the
supremacy of the Old World. If the Pit Fighters ever hire any

#### Norse Warband

O’ Sigmar preserve us from the wrath of the Norsemen’
The land of Norsca lies to the far north of the Empire across
the stormy sea of Claws. This is a harsh land of snow and ice
with mountains of Frost and Dusk that reach unto the heavens
themselves and march right down to the sea. The humans that
live here are powerfully built, with large, well muscled
frames and long limbs. The Norse are a bloodthirsty people
whose society is based entirely around war and fighting.
They make or produce very little in their inhospitable
homeland and their attitude is to take whatever they need
from the lands of others. Many a time their dreaded longships
have brought terror and destruction to the lands of men and
the other races. The Norse people live in marauder tribes or
clans much like the Unberogens who were, centuries earlier,
the founders of the Empire. It is for these reasons that the
Norse are seen as a very primitive and uncivilised race by
others and indeed many Norse tribes openly worship the dark
gods of Chaos as their own.
All Norse warriors are trained in the art of war at a very
young age and become skilled in the use of sword, axe and
shield for their’s is a brutal society where only the strongest
survive. Probably because of their well founded fearsome
reputation the Norsemen have few allegiances apart from to
their clan and their ancestors and so make excellent
mercenaries.
Despite their brutish behaviour the Norse make superb
natural sailors rivalling even the High Elves and it was
indeed the Norse who were the first humans to discover
Lustria and the South Lands. In their longships, the Norse
sailed from the Old World to Lustria, establishing the first
colony, Skeggi. The Norse plague the coast of Lustria raiding
many coastal settlements but it is their desire for riches and
saga that have driven them further inland to pillage the
temples of the Slann.

##### Special Rules

All Norse Warriors are subject to the following special rules:
Seamen: The Norse are a sea faring people and spend much
of their time rowing boats. To represent this, all Norse
warriors get +2 to Strength when trying to row a boat.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

#### Dark Elf Warband

Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High
Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are
better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure
have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave
destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly
feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted
forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark
Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for
this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves.
The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in
their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark
God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the
Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting
pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.
Despite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled
as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It
is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that
bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in
their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark
Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to
the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands
don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.

##### Special Rules

Kindred Hatred: The Dark Elves have been fighting the
High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two
races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves

excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin.

powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and
unreliable.

#### Clan Eshin

Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared
his world with another and altogether different race. There
have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a
scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer,
scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these
creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the
world of man, undermining his great cities, infiltrating his
sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world
spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests. These creatures call
themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the mutant spawn of
an older age of chaos and mutation.
Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from
their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries
they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague
in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least
they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has
suddenly changed. Now the destruction of Mordheim has
created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind.
Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for
the stones of power that men in their ignorance call
wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as
warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of
gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that
commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that
spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their
blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul
sorceries. Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has
been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown
increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has
appeared – a dark blessing from the skies!
For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune
time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is
divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan
fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of
the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race.
Mordheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else
the City of the Damned would already be overrun with
ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this
secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous
armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of
Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to

gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan
nests.
The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their
task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes,
they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the
thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors
practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned
Rat, their ever hungering and hideous god. There are none
better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure
of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient.
Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim
there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions
upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the
Damned.
##### Special Rules

#### Clan Moulder

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander
To the north, in the blasted wasteland known as the Troll
Country, lie the infernal breeding pits of Clan Moulder. Their
stronghold is burrowed into the walls and floor of a ragged
chasm in a snowy mountainside in the northern spur of the
Worlds Edge Mountains. Volcanic pools at the bottom of the
chasm raise a greyish plume of steam and vapours over it and
mix the stink of sulphur with the stench of matted fur and
excrement carried on the wind. Worse than the stench is the
dreadful cacophony of howls, squawks, screams, snarls and
shrieks which clamour out of the frozen chasm like the
wailing, lost souls of a thousand different races. It is not
without good reason that this place is known as the Hell Pit.
Clan Moulder is constantly seeking new, stable breeds of
fighting beasts that they can sell or hire to the other clans.
Small bands of Packmasters scour the lands around Hell Pit
for creatures to capture for their diabolic experimentation.
Chaos monsters from the Northern Wastes are the most
dangerous but also the most valuable by far. Huge and
monstrous creatures always offer the best chance to create a
new breed of fighting beasts. Clan Moulder hunters will trail
a Manticore or Hydra for months waiting for an opportunity
to strike. Captured beasts are hauled away into Hell Pit in
great iron cages. Once in the pit they are exposed to
Warpstone and fed on carefully measured amounts of it until
the desired mutations start to form. Rumours abound of the
crossbred monstrosities they have created of which the
fearsome Rat Ogre is undoubtedly the most infamous. Rat-
like wolves have also been seen prowling in Kislev, along
with curious furred breeds of troll and huge, seldom-seen
burrowing creatures. Some of the beasts the Packmasters
catch are simply trained and sold to other clans. Clan
Moulder Packmasters are experts in training wild and vicious
monsters. Truculent beasts are broken so that they obey and
passive creatures goaded until they become killers. The
bottom of Hell Pit is filled with the detritus of the clan's
failed experiments: pale twisted monstrosities that shamble or

flop across the floor of the chasm and feed on one another.
Clan Moulder is the clan with the most experience and
knowledge about the effects of Warpstone, possible with the
exception of the Order of Grey Seers.

strength of a canine. The Wolf Rats are the same size and
build as a wolf but with hairless legs that end in rat like
claws, a rat's head and a rat tail. In addition they often have
hideous mutations such as an extra head, abnormal bone
growth or insect like tails. Those that truly lupines are kept in
spiked cages and fed on their own dead, so that when they are
finally unleashed into the outside world they attack anything
in their path in a blood rage.

#### Clan Pestilens

Jarod glanced down the street... All seemed clear. He could not immediately tell why, but he was sure someone, or something was there.
Maybe it was just that strange odour hanging around the ruins here. He shivered, although Mordheim seemed to have its own special smell,
this made him think of death.
A sudden noise made him jump up and bring his crossbow to bear on the still empty street. A strange mist started to creep in and soft
squeaks could be made out. As Jarod sounded the alarm, two figures rushed towards him. Dressed in tattered cloaks, they wielded what
looked like a spiked censer. Almost suffocating in the bellowing smoke, he fired his crossbow. Then, just before the spiked smoking ball
smashed his skull, he saw two red gleaming eyes in a disease ridden skaven face.
In the Old World sickness and plague are a fact of life and
many people blame rats for spreading contagion. They are
more right than they know.
Clan Pestilens exist to spread plague and pestilence through
their foul rites and experiments. They have been chosen by
the Horned Rat himself as his Disciples of Decay and are
responsible for more deaths than any other clan, mainly due
to the plagues and diseases they have unleashed on the cities
and empires in the Old World. The main strongholds of Clan
Pestilens consist of captured Slann temple-cities in the humid
jungles of Lustria and a mighty stronghold in the southlands.
They also have their own quarter in Skavenblight,
maintaining their position as one of the most powerful clans
in the Skaven Under-Empire.
Plague Monks favour knives and staffs while the higher
ranked members carry heavier weapons and even warplock
pistols. The knives are long and serrated and are often rusty
or smeared in rotten corpses to ensure that the any non-lethal
wound becomes infected. The Clan members do not need to
wear armor since their bodies are hardened by the diseases
they carry they feel little pain, they rely on their thick fur to
protect them. The robes themselves offer protection equal to
soft leather and will be considered as light armor when
combined with the scattered pieces of chain mail or plate that
some plague monks do wear underneath their putrid robes.

#### Clan Skryre

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander and the Skryre Warband by Chris Haak
After the Eshin Clan had their coffers bolstered by the
warpstone collected from Mordheim clan Skryre became
suspicious. Ikit Klaw sent out his spies and found that
Mordheim offered a source of warpstone far easier to acquire
than mining. It would also be a great testing ground for their
new weapons of destruction.
The warped genius of the Skaven engineers is concentrated in
the work of Clan Skryre. They are the most technologically
advanced, using warpstone technology to create formidable
combat teams able to survive the City of Evil, and return with
hoards of warpstone for their warlock engineers.
Jezzail rifles, poisoned wind globes, and Warpfire throwers
are all the creations of Clan Skryre, the engineers. These
skaven are more intelligent than most, and design the war
machines used by skaven in massed warfare. When turned
upon the streets of Mordheim, the effects of these weapons
can be devastating.
Clan Skryre Warbands have great technological knowledge
and prefer Magic and Technology to combat.

0-1 Clan Skryre Rat Ogre
300 gold crowns to hire
The warlock engineers of Clan Skryre are renowned for their
fiendish inventions which utilize a blend of foul magic and arcane
machinery. The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is the pinnacle of their
devilish engineering, utilizing the corpse of a Rat Ogre combined
with a mechanical exoskeleton and powered by refined wyrdstone.
Clan Skryre has sent out the handful that it has made to further test
them in combat. In battle it is a terrifying if somewhat unreliable
beast.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Weapons/Armor: Jaws, claws, and a miniature Warpfire
thrower on its mechanical left arm.
Special Rules
Bio Machinery: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not alive as
such, being a monstrous combination of dead flesh, arcane
Skaven technology and dark sorcery. The Clan Skryre Rat
Ogre is immune to psychology and never leaves combat.
Experience: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres never gains
experiences.
Fear: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a fearsome, monstrous
beast that causes fear.
Immune to Poison: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not affected
by any poisons.
Large: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge creature that
towers above the heads of its fellow Skaven and men alike.
Any warrior may shoot at a Rat Ogre, even if it is not the
closet target.
May Not Run: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge
lumbering monster-machine that lacks the sheer animal speed
of a living Rat Ogre. It may not run but may charge.
Metallic Body: These give Clan Skryre Rat Ogre a 4+
armor save.
Unreliable: The technology of biomechanics is still pretty
much in its infancy and as with most Clan Skryre
experiments is neither safe nor entirely reliable! At the
beginning of each turn, the Skaven player should roll a D6 to

activate and work the Rat Ogre. On a roll of 2-6 everything is
fine and the Rat Ogre may be moved normally. On the roll of
a 1, something has gone drastically wrong — roll again on
the Malfunction table.
Upkeep: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres is always in need of
repair after battle and so the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres has an
upkeep of 35 GC, or the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres stops
working.
Malfunction table
D6 Result
1 Explodes: Something has gone horribly wrong with
the Rat Ogre's warpstone generator and it has
overloaded, exploding in a bright green flash! All
models within 6” of the Rat Ogre receive a single
Strength 5 hit. The Rat Ogre is completely destroyed.
Do not roll for injuries after the game.
2 Goes Berserk! From now until the end of the game,
the Rat Ogre is out of control. At the start of each of
the Skaven player's turns, the Rat Ogre will move
randomly (use the Artillery Scatter dice from
Warhammer to determine the distance and direction
moved) — if there are any warriors within charge
range (of either side) it will charge them, otherwise it
will move full pace towards the nearest warrior.
3 Shuts Down: The warpstone generator fizzles out and
the Rat Ogre comes to a halt for the rest of the battle.
It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.
4 Temporary Loss of Control: The Rat Ogre moves in
a random direction and if it comes into contact with
any warriors (of either side) it attacks and counts as
charging. If it does not move into contact with any
warriors but there are warriors within range of its
Warpfire thrower, it will fire this at them instead.
5-6 Freezes: The Rat Ogre just freezes on the spot for this
turn. It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.


#### Orc Mob

Orcs enjoy fighting and looting more than anything else. Because of this, an Orc’s life is spent in constant battle – either
with his fellow Orcs or some other enemy. With its wealth of opponents and loot ready for the taking, Mordheim offers
the perfect opportunity for an aspiring Orc Warboss to prove himself. What follows are complete rules, written by
Mark Havener, for Orc & Goblin warbands.
Among the races of the Warhammer world, none enjoy the
prospect of a good looting more than Orcs and Goblins. For
this reason many Orc warbands have been drawn to the city
of Mordheim and the wyrdstone that lies hidden there. Of
course, Orcs would much rather ambush other warbands and
take their wyrdstone than collect it themselves, but their goals
are the same as any other warband – collect as much treasure
as possible! These traits are reflected in the following special
rules:

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In
any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.

2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

An Orc warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and

Boyz.
Goblin Warriors: Your warband may include any number of
Goblin Warriors, though it may not have more than two
Goblins for each Orc in the warband (including Orc Heroes).
Cave Squigs: Your warband may include up to five Cave
Squigs. You may never have more Cave Squigs in your
warband than you have Goblin Warriors.
Troll: Your warband may include up to one Troll.

An Orc Boss is a tough and brutal warrior, who will throw his lads

toughest and most barbaric member of the warband and if any of his
Boyz think otherwise, the band may soon find itself with one less
member!

Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.
0-1 Orc Shaman
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc Shamans are outcasts from Orc society. They are gifted by the
Orc gods Gork and Mork with powers they can neither understand
nor completely control. Many join roaming Orc warbands where
they are no longer shunned for their abilities, but respected for
them.

0-3 Orc Big ‘Uns
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc society is a savage hierarchy where only the toughest survive
and rise through the ranks (often atop the bodies of other
challengers). Big ’Uns are such rising stars, and they carry out the
orders of the Orc Boss. If the Boss ever falls, it is up to the Big ’Uns
to decide on a new leader (usually through personal combat).

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Goblin Warriors
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins are often used as cannon fodder (as well as a food source in
lean times!) by their larger Orc cousins. They are usually not as
well equipped as Orc Boyz, having to make do with whatever the
Orcs do not want or cannot use.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 2 3 3 3 1 3 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Goblins may be armed with weapons
and armor chosen from Goblin equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Goblin Warriors are subject to the rules for
Animosity (see Special Rules for details). Note: A Goblin
Warrior who fails his Animosity test and rolls a 1 for the
result will never charge an Orc Henchman, though he will
still use any missile weapons to attack as normal. Goblins are
far too afraid of Orcs to challenge them individually.
Not Orcs: Orcs don’t expect much from non-Orcs, and are
therefore not unsettled if Goblins or Cave Squigs break or get
cut down in battle. In fact, they expect as much from these
weaklings! Therefore, when testing to see if an Orc Warband
needs to take a Rout test, each Goblin Warrior or Cave Squig
taken out of action only counts as half a model. Therefore, a
band of 5 Orcs and 10 Goblins (15 models) would only have
to take a test if 4 models fell (4 Orcs or 8 Goblins, or some
combination thereof).
Runts: Goblins may gain experience but if they happen to
roll ‘That Lad’s got talent’ they are immediately killed by
their Orc overlords for becoming too ‘mouthy’ (remove the
Gobbo from the roster).

0-5 Cave Squigs
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins raise the deadly Cave Squigs. These creatures are a curious
blend of animal and fungus, and are composed mostly of teeth,
horns, and a nasty temperament.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Big gob and brutality! Cave Squigs
never use or need weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
a Goblin Warrior, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without a Goblin within 6" at the start of its
Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point on, move
the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each of its
Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact with
another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model in
hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of the
Orc & Goblin player’s control until the end of the game.

Not Orcs: See Goblin Warriors entry for rules.
Animals: Cave Squigs are animals of a sort and so do not
gain experience.
 
Orc Boyz
25 gold crowns to hire
Orc Boyz are savage and tough. They fear nothing that they can get
their bare hands on, though they are even more ignorant and
superstitious than most other beings in the Warhammer world. They
form the core of any Orc warband.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 4 1 2 1 7
Weapons/Armor: Boyz may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Orc equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Orc Boyz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).
 
0-1 Troll
200 gold crowns to hire
Trolls are not intelligent enough to recognize the value of gold, but
large amounts of food can often instill a certain loyalty in them.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armor: Trolls do not require weapons to fight
but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If the warband lacks the gold to pay
the upkeep, the Boss has the option of sacrificing two Goblin
Warriors or Cave Squigs to the Troll in lieu of buying food
(Trolls eat nearly anything). If this fee is not paid (either in
gold or in warband members) the Troll gets hungry and
wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armor saves.


#### Black Orc Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Smarter, stronger, more vicious and better equipped than the
normal Orc (and that’s saying something when you’re talking
about Orcs), Black Orcs are amongst some of the worst foes
anyone can face in single combat...and a band of them is
certainly something to put the fear into the hearts of men!
They do appear more built than born and it is little wonder
that there are many rumours regarding their origins.
Since the Storm of Chaos there are many, many more of
these monsters now wandering the Empire, having followed
Grimgor Ironhide in his Waaagh! Where once the forces of
the Empire could have tracked down warbands of these
creatures in a matter of weeks, now there is no means or
enough men to perform such a task and thus the Black Orcs
roam freely.
What aims do the Black Orcs have? What is the point of a
tornado? It is meaningless to ponder such matters because all
the Orcs want is to fight and that means attacking whomever
crosses their path. What they gain from such battling is not
completely understood, but it seems to be nothing more
complicated than the chance to fight. There is no logic from
them nor can any be expected.

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is

has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or

Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Let the goons do the work: Black Orcs rely on themselves
to do the killing and do not ride mounts of any kind. Only
normal Orcs may ride a boar or other such mount.
Da Boss is Dead!: If the Boss should be killed a Black Orc
will always assume leadership of the warband before any
other type, irrespective of relative experience. The
replacement will automatically acquire the "Oi Behave!"
skill.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Black Orc warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns with which you can use
to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.
Black Orc Boss: Each Black Orc warband must have one
Black Orc Boss.
Black Orcs: Your warband may include up to 2 Black Orcs

Oi Behave!: If any Henchman fails his Animosity test within
6” of the Boss, the player may opt to have the boss stamp his
authority (and clenched fist) on the situation.
The misbehaving Henchman will receive an automatic hit at
the strength of the Orc player’s choosing. If the Henchman is
still on his feet after his slap, he may add a number equal to
the strength of the slap to his subsequent roll to determine the
effects of Animosity.
e.g. The player decides that the Boss will hit a misbehaving
Henchman with a S2 slap. If the slap fails to Knock Down,
Stun or Out of Action the Henchman, then he adds +2 to the

but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If this fee is not paid the Troll gets
hungry and wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armor saves.

Orc Shootaz
25 gold crowns to hire
Not all Orcs enjoy getting into a fight straight away. Some are
hunters, tracking prey and shooting it down from a distance; others
recognise that sometimes you need to soften up a really tough foe
from a distance before moving in to finish them off. This is the
closest Orcs come to outright cowardice.

Special Rules
Animosity: Shootaz are subject to the rules for Animosity
(see Special Rules for details).
Uncommon: A warband may not hire more Shootaz than
they have Boyz. If a boy dies and the Shootaz outnumber the
Boyz, the next hire must be a boy so that the balance is
restored.
 
0-4 Savage Orcs
40 gold crowns to hire
Savage Orcs persist in their primitive ways to this day. Even by
Orcish standards, they are a complete bunch of primitives. They use
mostly stone or bone weapons and go around half-naked, or worse.
Many live in their own tribes and have their own ways of fighting
that make them easily distinguishable.

Special Rules
Unstable: These Orcs are not quite all there. They do not
suffer from Animosity but instead have a host of their own
issues to deal with.
Crazy: Savage Orcs always pass any Leadership-based Tests
they have to take. A side effect of this is that their primitive
minds and they may never learn Academic Skills should they
become a Hero on an Advance Roll.
Savage: Savage Orcs are subject to Frenzy as detailed in the
Psychology section of the Mordheim rulebook. They must
always run or charge towards the nearest opponent they can
see. If no enemy is visible they are moved under the player’s
control. They can never use any form of armor or ranged
weapons. Savage Orcs are also so primitive for other Boyz
and can never have the Leader ability or use their Ld stat for
rout tests, unless they are the only models from the warband
left on the board.


#### Forest Goblin Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Forest Goblin tribes dwell deep within The Great Forest. They have completely adapted to their surroundings, learning stealth
and camouflage to evade their neighbours.
Gold motivates the Forest Goblins as it does any warband, albeit for different reasons. It is worthless to them as currency but
as a metallic resource, it is valuable nonetheless. Instead of using gold to buy weapons and armor, Forest Goblins actually
coat their stone equipment with the metal. This has led unscrupulous leaders to send their henchmen into certain ambush, only
to arrive later to collect the arrowheads and spear points from the remains of their former employees
Forest Goblins are able to create poisons with a precision surpassing even the Dark Elves. Their natural surroundings
harbour any number of poisonous creatures, including the gigantic spiders they are rumoured to prod into combat with their
enemies. Coating their weapons with deadly venom, the Goblins are capable of felling any foe, no matter their size. Led by
their Chieftain (usually the Goblin with the loudest voice), the Forest Goblins appear from nowhere and strike with feral
ferocity before receding into the trees, leaving injuries as the only proof they were ever there.

##### Special Rules

Natives: Used to poking through the underbrush, Forest
Goblins suffer no movement penalties from moving through
any wooded terrain.
Animosity: Goblins enjoy nothing more than a good scrap,
unfortunately they’re not always very discerning about who
they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of the Goblin
player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is either an
Orc or Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior has taken
offense to something one of his mates has done or said. Do
not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat
(they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how offended
the model is, roll another D6 and consult the following chart
to see what happens:
D6 Result
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc
or Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach
(if there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one
nearest to the mad model), the offended warrior will
immediately charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand
combat against the source of his ire. At the end of this
round of combat, the models will immediately move 1"
apart and no longer count as being in close combat
(unless one of them fails another Animosity test and rolls
this result again). If there are no friendly Orc or Goblin
Henchmen or Hired Swords within charge reach, and the
warrior is armed with a missile weapon, he immediately
takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin
Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above applies,
or if the nearest friendly model is an Goblin Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart.
In any case, the warrior in question may take no other
action this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked
in hand-to-hand combat.
2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Goblin, but
he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.

6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
    laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly

    names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first
one to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as
possible towards the nearest enemy model, charging into
combat if possible. If there are no enemy models within
sight, the Goblin may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a
single turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Goblin
within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior must
charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Giant Spider Mount: If you are using the optional rules for
mounts, then your warband’s heroes may ride giant spiders.
The rider’s armor save increased by +1, exactly as if mounted
on an ordinary horse. The rider need not dismount to climb
terrain (including building exteriors) and the spider’s natural
climbing abilities allow the rider to re-roll any failed
climbing attempts. The Giant Spider count as Rare 5 and
Cost 45Gold Crown for Forest Goblins Mobs.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Forest Goblin warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 20.
Chieftain: Each Forest Goblin warband must have one
Chieftain.
Braves: Your warband may include up to four Braves.
Shaman: Your warband may include one Shaman, but he can
only be taken instead of a Brave.
Forest Goblins: Any number of models may be Forest
Goblins.
Red Toof Boyz: Your warband may include up to five Red
Toof Boyz.
Sluggas: Your warband may include up to five Sluggas.
Gigantic Spider: Your warband may include one Gigantic
Spider.
##### Starting Experience

A Chieftain starts with 17 experience.
A Brave and Shaman starts with 6 experience.
Henchmen start with 0 experience.

#### Hobgoblins Wolf Rider Mob

Based on Hobgoblin Raiders by the unnamed author and Hob Goblins Warband by Brian Coggin & James S. Mackay.
The acrid smell of wolf musk precedes them as they drift silently through the ruins. You know they’re somewhere, but still you
don’t see them. The sharp twangs of their bowstrings echoing through the city send you diving for cover, but it isn’t until the
deadly barbed arrows strike that you see your opponents. As you muster the warband, your cunning opposition is already
moving back into the shadows to circle for another guerrilla strike. The treacherous hobgoblins have arrived!

##### Background

Khans and their hobgoblin wolf riders have always plunged
deep into any territory where their swift swords and sure
arrows could bring them wealth, and Hogada Khan and his
Keregit raiders are no different. When human captives
revealed to Hogada the rumors of the untold riches available
in Mordheim, the opportunistic leader immediately
abandoned his orders from the Ka-Khan and steered his wolf
riders towards the City of the Dammed.
The Keregit raiders keep their camp on a constant move, and
few have discovered the motley collection of yurts and lived
to tell the tale. Years of constant warfare has taught Hogada
Khan that mobility and secrecy are his two greatest allies.
Certainly more reliable than most of his treacherous warriors.
Only a swift sword delivering death to those who oppose his
rule has kept this group together. Although the wealth the
hobgoblins are earning in Mordheim helps with loyalty, as it
far exceeds what they’re used to finding on the warpath.
Soon after arriving Hogada began raiding the city with large
groups of wolf riders, but the clever git quickly realized two
things. First, Mordheim is not the steppe, and large parties
cannot move through the ruins with the stealth and agility a
hobgoblin must have to survive. Secondly, the Khan
discovered that wolves were not the best form of
transportation through the rubble, as his warriors were
constantly dismounting to traverse small caverns, pass
through doorways, and climb to upper levels of buildings.
Now Hogada sends his Ilkhans, or subordinate khans, into the
city with small and stealthy raiding parties to gather the
precious wyrdstone. Although some of these groups still have
wolves as steeds, the majority of the raiders have retrained
their wolves to fight without riders.
The new system works well for the hobgoblins, and they’ve
seen a great deal of success since arriving on the scene. The
stealthy hobgoblins are deadly with their bows, and the
slavering wolves provide the raiders with an excellent fast
attack squad. As long as the treacherous warriors remain
disciplined, the hobgoblins are warbands to be reckoned with.

##### Special Rules

Treacherous Gits: Hobgoblins are notorious for their
treachery in all things, including combat. For all henchmen
not already in hand to hand combat roll a d6 at the beginning
of each turn. If they roll a 1 on that d6 then roll another and
reference the following chart:
1 – The treacherous git switches sides, and can now be
controlled by the opposing team for the rest of the
battle. If there are multiple opponents the hobgoblin
will attach himself the warband with the highest
rating. Note that this hobgoblin must still take
treachery tests, and therefore could end up back on his
original team
2-5 – The hobgoblin is too interested in saving his own skin
that he will refuse to shoot or charge this turn, but may
perform other actions.
6 – The henchman is infused with fresh determination and
loyalty, and doesn’t need to roll further treachery tests
for the rest of the game
Giant Wolves: The warband may include a number of Giant
Wolves as detailed below. These must be ridden into battle, they 
may not be used as loose animals.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

### Campaigns

Warbands travel to the City of the Damned from all over the
Old World. They come from many races and for many
reasons but ultimately they must all face the dangers of the
dim alleys and twisting, winding streets of Mordheim.
Although it is great fun to fight individual battles, part of the
challenge of Mordheim is to build your warband into a force
to be reckoned with. A campaign gives your warband the
chance to gain experience and new skills, as well as the
opportunity to hire extra warriors as its fame and fortune
increases.

#### Starting a campaign

To start a campaign you’ll need at least two players,
preferably three or more. Players may have more than one
warband, but most people prefer to run one at a time, as this
allows them to devote more of their attention to painting,
modelling and playing with their favourite warband.
You can start a campaign as soon as two players have
recruited their warbands. New players can join the campaign
any time after that. Although the new warbands will be less
experienced they will soon learn new skills. Fighting other,
more powerful, warbands will allow them to develop more
quickly.

#### Playing a campaign game

To start the campaign, the two players select one of the
scenarios to fight (see the Scenarios section). At
the end of each game the players work out how much
experience their warriors have earned and how much
wyrdstone the warband has collected before returning to its
encampment.
Experience is expressed as Experience points which Heroes
and Henchmen groups receive for surviving each game. This
is covered later in the Experience section. When a Hero or a
group of Henchmen has sufficient Experience points they
receive an advance. An advance might improve a warrior’s
characteristics profile, adding to his WS, BS, S etc, or he
might gain a special skill such as Mighty Blow or Acrobat.
After each game the warriors collect wyrdstone. This is
recorded on the warband’s roster sheet, and can later be sold
for gold, used for trading, etc. You can recruit more warriors
or buy new weapons from traders. All this is explained in the
Income and Trading sections, later.


#### Post battle sequence

After the battle is over, both players work their way through
the following sequence. You do not have to work through it
all at once (try to do the first three parts straight after the
battle – you may wish to consider further purchases later) but

any dice rolls must be seen by both players or a neutral third
party.
1 Injuries. Determine the extent of injuries for each warrior
who is out of action at the end of the game. See the Serious
Injuries, on page 118.
2 Allocate experience. Heroes and Henchmen groups gain
experience for surviving battles. See the Experience and
Scenarios sections for details.
3 Roll on the Exploration chart. See the Income section for
details.
4 Sell Wyrdstone. This can only be done once per post battle
sequence.
5 Check available veterans. Roll to see how much
Experience worth of veterans is available for hire. You don’t
have to commit to hiring any at this point.
6 Make rarity rolls and buy rare items. Make rolls for any
rare items you intend to buy and pay for them. These items
go into the warband’s stash.
7 Look for Dramatis Personae. If you want to hire any.
8 Hire new recruits & buy common items. New recruits
come equipped with their free dagger and may be bought
common items. This is done in any order and may be done
several times. Note that newly hired recruits cannot buy rare
items. They can, however, be equipped with rare items if
there are any in the warband’s stash in stage 9.
9 Reallocate equipment. Swap equipment between models
as desired (provided they are eligible to use it).
10 Update your warband rating. You are now ready to
fight again.

#### Death of a Warrior

When a warrior is killed (Hero or Henchman) all his weapons
and equipment are lost. This is very important, so be clear
about it from the start. It is not possible to reallocate a
warrior’s weapons or equipment once he is dead.

#### Death of a Leader

If the leader of the warband is slain, the Hero with the next
highest Leadership value takes command. He then gains the
Leader ability (although he must continue to use his original
Skill list). If there is more than one Hero eligible to assume
command, the warrior with the most Experience points
becomes the leader. If that is also is even the player may choose.
In the case of Undead warbands, the death of the Vampire
means that the warband’s Necromancer must take over. If the
warband doesn’t include one, the spells that hold the restless
dead together unravel, and the warband collapses into a pile
of bones. You can buy a Vampire after the next game, at
which point the Necromancer will step down (whether he
wants to or not) and lose the Leader skill.


#### Buying new equipment between games

As explained in the Trading section, warriors may purchase
new equipment and armaments using the warband’s treasury.
Warriors can also swap equipment between themselves.
Alternatively, old equipment can be hoarded and re-used at a
later date.
Weapons and armor purchased, swapped or taken from
storage for your warband must be of an appropriate type for
the warrior, as indicated by the warband lists. Record any
changes to the warrior’s equipment on the roster sheet.

#### Serious injuries

During a game some warriors will be taken out of action and
removed from play. At that time it doesn’t matter whether the
warrior is dead, unconscious, injured or just playing dead – in
game terms he is no longer capable of fighting in the battle
which is all that matters.
When you are playing a campaign it matters a great deal what
happens to warriors who are taken out of action! They might
recover completely and be ready to fight in the next battle, or
they might have sustained injuries. Worst of all they might
die, or be so badly injured that they have to retire.
When a Henchman receives a serious injury this is treated
differently than if a Hero received one (this is to represent the
greater effect that losing a Hero would have on your
warband). Working out the extent of a Henchman’s injuries is
very simple. You will need to roll on the chart opposite to
determine what has happened to your Hero. The chart covers
a whole range of injuries and random things that might befall
your warrior. Bear in mind that only Heroes who are taken
out of action are obliged to roll on this chart.

##### Henchman with Serious Injuries

Henchmen who are out of action at the end of the battle are
removed permanently from the roster sheet on a D6 roll of 1-
2. They have either suffered severe injuries, died of their
wounds, or decided to quit the warband. On a roll of 3-6 they
can fight in the next battle as normal.

##### Heroes with Serious Injuries

After a battle some of your Heroes may be taken out of
action. You will need to determine the extent of their injuries
before the next game.
To use the Heroes’ Serious Injuries chart opposite, roll two
D6. The first dice roll represents ‘tens’ and the second
‘units’, so that a roll of 1 and 5 is 15, a roll of 3 and 6 is 36,
etc. This type of dice roll is referred to as a ‘D66 roll’.


#### Heroes’ serious injuries chart (roll D66)

11-15 DEAD
The warrior is dead and his body is abandoned in the dark
alleys of Mordheim, never to be found again. All the
weapons and equipment he carried are lost. Remove him
from the warband’s roster.
16-21 MULTIPLE INJURIES
The warrior is not dead but has suffered a lot of wounds. Roll
D6 times on this table. Re-roll any ‘Dead’, ‘Captured’ and
further ‘Multiple Injuries’ results.
22 LEG WOUND
The warrior’s leg is broken. He suffers a -1 Movement
characteristic penalty from now on.
23 ARM WOUND
Roll again: 1 = Severe arm wound. The arm must be
amputated. The warrior may only use a single one handed
weapon from now on. 2-6 = Light wound. The warrior must
miss the next game.
24 MADNESS
Roll a D6. On a 1-3 the warrior suffers from stupidity; on 4-6
the warrior suffers from frenzy from now on (see the
Psychology section for details).
25 SMASHED LEG
Roll again: 1 = The warrior may not run any more but he may
still charge. 2-6 = The warrior misses the next game.
26 CHEST WOUND
The warrior has been badly wounded in the chest. He
recovers but is weakened by the injury so his Toughness is
reduced by -1.
31 BLINDED IN ONE EYE
The warrior survives but loses the sight in one eye; randomly
determine which. A character that loses an eye has his
Ballistic Skill reduced by -1. If the warrior is subsequently
blinded in his remaining good eye he must retire from the
warband.
32 OLD BATTLE WOUND
The warrior survives, but his wound will prevent him from
fighting if you roll a 1 on a D6 at the start of any battle. Roll
at the start of each battle from now on.
33 NERVOUS CONDITION
The warrior’s nervous system has been damaged. His
Initiative is permanently reduced by -1.
34 HAND INJURY
The warrior’s hand is badly injured. His Weapon Skill is
permanently reduced by -1.
35 DEEP WOUND
The warrior has suffered a serious wound and must miss the
next D3 games while he is recovering. He may do nothing at
all while recovering.
36 ROBBED
The warrior manages to escape, but all his weapons, armor
and equipment are lost.

41-55 FULL RECOVERY
The warrior has been knocked unconscious, or suffers a light
wound from which he makes a full recovery.
56 BITTER ENMITY
The warrior makes a full physical recovery, but is
psychologically scarred by his experience. From now on the
warrior hates the following (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1-3 The individual who caused the injury. If it was a Henchman,
he hates the enemy leader instead.
4 The leader of the warband that caused the injury.
5 The entire warband of the warrior responsible for the injury.
6 All warbands of that type.
61 CAPTURED
The warrior regains consciousness and finds himself held
captive by the other warband.
He may be ransomed at a price set by the captor or
exchanged for one of their warband who is being held
captive.
Captives may be sold to slavers at a price of D6x5 GC.
Undead may kill their captive and gain a new Zombie.
The Possessed may sacrifice the prisoner. The leader of the
warband will gain +1 Experience if they do so.
Captives who are exchanged or ransomed retain all their
weapons, armor and equipment; if captives are sold, killed
or turned to Zombies, their weaponry, etc, is retained by their
captors.
62-63 HARDENED
The warrior survives and becomes inured to the horrors of
Mordheim. From now on he is immune to fear.
64 HORRIBLE SCARS
The warrior causes fear from now on.
65 SOLD TO THE PITS
The warrior wakes up in the infamous fighting pits of
Cutthroat’s Haven and must fight against a Pit Fighter. See
the Hired Swords section for full rules for Pit Fighters.
Roll to see which side charges, and fight the battle as normal.
If the warrior loses, roll to see whether he is dead or injured
(i.e., a D66 roll of 11-35). If he is not dead, he is thrown out
of the fighting pits without his armor and weapons and may
re-join his warband.
If the warrior wins he gains 50 GC, +2 Experience and is free
to rejoin his warband with all his weapons and equipment.
66 SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS
The warrior survives and rejoins his warband. He gains +1
Experience.


### Experience

As warriors take part in battles, those who survive become
more experienced, and improve their battle skills. This is
represented in campaigns by Experience points.
Warriors earn Experience points when they take part in a
battle. Once a warrior has enough points he gains an advance.
This takes the form of an increased characteristic or a new
skill. Warriors who survive long enough may progress to
become great Heroes, with many skills that they have picked
up during their long and glorious fighting career.
When warriors are recruited, some of them already have
some experience. The warband lists detail how many
Experience points different warriors begin with. Record these
on your warband roster sheet by ticking the right number of
boxes. No extra advances are gained for this experience. It
simply represents the experience the warriors have
accumulated before the warband is formed.

#### Earning experience

The Experience points warriors earn depend on the scenario.
Different scenarios have different objectives and
consequently warriors can earn experience in slightly
different ways.
Extra Experience points are always added to the fighter’s
total after the game is over, though it is a good idea to keep a
record of the opponents your warrior puts out of action
during the battle, as this often affects the experience they
gain.
If you look through the scenarios you will notice that
warriors always earn +1 Experience point for surviving a
battle. They earn this even if they are injured – so long as
they live to fight again!
The Scenarios section includes details of how many
Experience points are earned for each scenario.

#### Experience advances

As warriors earn more Experience points they are entitled to
make Advance rolls. The warband roster sheet shows how
much experience a Hero or a Henchman group must
accumulate before making a further roll. When the
accumulated experience reaches a box that has thick borders,
the warrior may make an Advance roll. The roll(s) must be
taken immediately after the game in which the advance was
earned, while both players are present to witness the result.
Note that Henchmen gain experience as a group, and
consequently all the warriors in one group gain the same
advance.

#### Underdogs

If a warband is deemed to be significantly weaker than the other participating warbands it may be considered an Underdog - though this must be decided unanimously by all players. An Underdog warband will recieve a bonus +1 experience to all participating Heroes and Henchmen Groups. 

#### Advance rolls

Make Advance rolls straight after the battle so both players
can witness the result. Roll 2D6 and consult the appropriate
tables below.
##### Heroes

2D6 Result
2 - 5 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill. See the
Magic section.
6 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Strength; 4-6
= +1 Attack.
7 Characteristic Increase. Choose either +1 WS or +1 BS.
8 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Initiative; 4-6
= +1 Leadership.
9 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Wound; 4-6
= +1 Toughness.
10 - 12 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill.
##### Henchmen

All warriors in the group gain the
same advance.
2D6 Result
2 - 4 Advance +1 Initiative.
5 Advance +1 Strength.
6 - 7 Advance Choose either +1 BS or +1WS.
8 Advance +1 Attack.
9 Advance +1 Leadership.
10 - 12 The lad’s got talent. One model in the group becomes a
Hero. If you already have the maximum number of
Heroes, roll again. The new Hero remains the same
Henchman type (e.g., a Ghoul stays as a Ghoul) and starts
with the same experience the Henchman had, with all his
characteristic increases intact. You may choose two skill
lists available to Heroes in your warband. These are the
skill types your new Hero can choose from when he gains
new skills. He can immediately make one roll on the
Heroes Advance table. The remaining members of the
Henchmen group, if any, roll again for the advance that
they have earned.
#### New skills

There are several types of skill and each has a separate list.
You may not choose the same skill twice for the same
warrior. The skills a Hero may have are restricted by the
warband he belongs to and what type of Hero he is.
To select a new skill for a Hero, pick the type of skill you
want from those available, then choose which skill has been
learned.


### Skills & Abilities Lists

The Skill lists are used to pick skills earned as advances. Your warrior is restricted to specific Skill lists depending upon his
warband type and what kind of warrior he is. Each warband entry includes a list of skills available to the Heroes of that
particular warband.
All warbands have their own strengths and weaknesses which relate to the skills available to them. For example, the Possessed
are good fighters and very strong, but they are not very academically minded.
Some warbands also have access to a unique Skill list, which is clearly indicated in their entry.

#### Common Skills

The common skills are available to any Hero, Henchmen & Hired Sword who wishers for these Skills.
Animal\Beast Handler (e.g. War hound): This skill is highly
beneficial if non-ridden animals are to be included in a warband.
This skill must be taken for specific animals and may be taken
multiple times for different animals. It represents knowledge of the
general care and well being of the animal as well as training
techniques.

A warrior with this skill has a beneficial effect on the animals under
his care. If a warrior has the Animal Handling skill for a particular
animal, any such animals may use his Leadership provided he is
within 6". If the Warband’s leader is also nearby, a player may
choose which of the warriors’ Leadership to use unless the animal is
stupid, in which case only the handler’s Leadership may be used. In
addition, stubborn animals with a handler in base contact ignore the
effects of stubbornness.

Beast Companion: A Hero or Warrior with this skill may buy an
attack animal, the attack animal must be set up with the owning
model within 3". But free to move around once started. The attack
animal may use the owner Leadership if within 6". The attack
animal does not count towards the maximum number of warriors
allowed in your warband. If the owner is stunned or knocked down,
the attack animal will move to it owner and guard him\her until the
Owner get up or the games ends. If the owner dies the attack animal
is lost.


Mark of Chaos: Few who travel to Mordheim do so with good intentions,
indeed many see the calamitous destruction of Sigmar's followers as a 
sign that the site is clearly of great interest to the Chaos Gods.
Eager to prove themselves to their new masters they may
dedicate themselves to their worship.

Heroes from a Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (other than
Skaven and undead) may immediately choose one Mark of Chaos. Due to the
brashness, arrogance, boastfulness, and self-importance instilled 
universally upon any Chaos worshipper who recieves a visible gift of their
patron god each Mark taken in this way will add an upkeep cost of 5 gold
per game. If the leader has any other mark then Undivided all heroes must 
have the same mark.

Medical Knowledge: If you have a warrior in your warband with
this skill you may re-roll a result on the Serious Injury table. If the
model with this skill is not taken out of action.

Musician: Musicians are important to a warband both during and
after a battle. They can sing and tell tales to raise extra income, sing
songs of valour during battle to embolden the troops, and rally the
troops when things look bad.
Warrior with this skill can choose skills from the Musicians Skills
list. Only one model per warband may have this skill, and Musicians 
recruited from the Warhammer books automatically have it.
Mob Mentality: If a model with this skill is within 3”
of at least three other models from his warband, then he gives all of
the models in that area, including himself, immunity to fear and +1
Initiative. If the model, with Mob Mentality, is taken out of action
while giving bonuses, then all models who are benefiting from the
effects will automatically fail an “All alone check” and move
accordingly.
Money Maker: The model with this skill utilizes his
talents and wares to try and make extra money after the adventure. If
the model is not taken out of action, they may roll an additional die
during the exploration phase. There may not be more than one character
with the Money Maker skill in your warband. There's just not enough money!
Ride: This skill is vital if a rider wishes to ride an
animal into combat. Taking this skill once will allow a Warrior to ride any
War Beast class mount. Taking this skill twice will allow a Warrior to ride any
Monstrous Mount. Taking this skill a third time will allow a Warrior to
ride Monsters. The mount options available to each Warrior must be appropriate
to their race however, so an Orc could not ride a Wolf (as Wolves are for Goblins!)
Warriors with this skill can choose skills from the Cavalry Skills list

Sneaky: All enemy models halve their Initiative range when trying
to detect this model while he is Hidden.


#### Combat Skills

Strike to Injure: The warrior can land his blows with uncanny
accuracy. Add +1 to all injury rolls caused by the model in hand-to-
hand combat.

Combat Master: The warrior is able to take on several opponents at
once. If he fights against more than one enemy at a time, he gains an
extra Attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase as long as he is
fighting two or more enemy models. In addition, the warrior is
immune to ‘All Alone’ tests.

Weapons Training: A warrior with this skill is adept at using many
different weapons. He may use any hand-to-hand combat weapon he
comes across, not just those in his equipment options.

Flashy Fighting: Few can match the ability of this warrior. He fights
with great skill and flair, weaving a web of steel around him. The model
gains +2 to all his rolls on Critical Hit tables in hand-to-hand
combat.

Expert Swordsman: This warrior has been expertly taught in the
art of swordsmanship. He may re-roll all missed attacks if he is
using a sword in the hand-to-hand phase of the turn that he charges.
Note that this only applies when they are armed with normal swords
or weeping blades, and not with double-handed swords or any other
weapons.

Step Aside: The warrior has a natural ability to avoid injury in
combat. The warrior gains a 5+ Ward Save against wounds inflicted by
hand-to-hand combat.

Axe Master: The warrior may parry with normal axes as per normal
parrying rules.

Disarm: The warrior may opt to forego his normal attacks and
attempt to disarm a single opponent. To disarm the opponent, the
warrior must declare what weapon he is disarming and then roll to
hit the foe at a -2 WS for a single handed weapon and a -3 WS for a
2 handed weapon. If successful the opponent must fight without the
designated weapon until he recovers it. The foe recovers his weapon
in the first Recovery Phase out of Hand-to-Hand. Not vs. natural
weaponry such as teeth/claws etc.

Expert Axeman: A Warrior with this skill may re-roll any failed to-hit
rolls with single-handed axes in the combat phase of the turn he charges.

Finishing Move: The warrior may opt to forgo his usual number of
attacks and make a single attack at an additional +2 Strength to its
normal strength. This can be used in conjunction with Mighty Blow,
Weapon Bonuses, and any other Strength enhancing abilities. The
blow is resolved last AFTER 2 Handed Weapons. Useful for taking
out Knocked Down models with high Toughness.

Follow-Through: If a Warrior manages to take all of their opponents
Out of Action in the same combat phase in which they charged they may
immediately make an additional 2" movement. This move may bring them 
into base contact with another model in which case they are considering
as having charged them too and will immediately fight in that turn's
combat. A Warrior may not Follow-Through more than once per turn, and
will be at -1 Strength for that combat phase (including for the purposes
of Impact Hits, also applying to their mount if they have one). 

Pugilist: The warrior may treat their bare fists as clubs. They will
never count as being Unarmed, and will count as being equipped with
clubs equal to their number of arms. Yes, you can be a mutant Pugilist
who boxes with their extra tentacles and crab hand.

Shield Smash: The warrior has trained to integrate his shield into
his fighting style. When using a Shield or Buckler in Hand-to-Hand
he may make a single additional attack resolved at the warriors
Strength. The Shield Smash cannot cause critical hits. 

Sweeping Blow: The warrior may opt to make a single sweep attack
against all the models in base to base contact with him instead of
making his normal attacks. Rather than rolling to hit, each foe must
take an Initiative test to avoid the blow. Each model failing their
test is hit, and the warrior rolls to wound each enemy
independently as normal. This maneuver can only be executed with
a two-handed weapon (including halberds and flails, etc.), but no
Strength bonuses granted by the weapons themselves are included.

Whip Master: The hero has mastered the brown hat, and may re-roll
all failed to-hit rolls with Whipcrack. Additionally enemies must 
re-roll any successful armour saves made from the Whipcrack attack.
Note that this does not benefit the hero's regular attacks.

#### Shooting Skills

Quick Shot: The warrior may shoot twice per turn with a bow or
crossbow (but not a crossbow pistol).

Pistolier: The warrior is an expert at using all kinds of pistols. If he
is equipped with a brace of pistols of any type (including crossbow
pistols), he may fire twice in the Shooting phase (though note that
normal reloading rules apply). If he has a single pistol then he may
fire it in the same turn it was reloaded.

Eagle Eyes: The warrior’s sight is exceptionally keen. He adds +6"
to the range of any missile weapon he is using.

Ranged Weapons Expert: The warrior has been trained to use some of the
more unusual weapons of the known world. He may use any missile
weapon he comes across, not just the weapons available from his
warband’s list.

Nimble: The warrior may move and fire with weapons that are
normally only used if the firer has not moved. Note that this skill
cannot be combined with the Quick Shot skill. This does not apply to
War Machines.

Trick Shooter: The warrior can shoot through the tiniest gap
without it affecting his aim. He ignores all modifiers for cover when
using missile weapons.

Action Hero: Ammunition somehow doesn't appear to be a problem for this
hero! The Warrior never needs to reload their weapons.

Knife-Fighter: The warrior is an unrivalled expert at using lightweight
throwing weapons. They can throw a maximum of three of these missiles in 
their shooting phase and may divide their shots between any targets 
within range as they wish. This only works with generic throwing weapons,
not Throwing Axes or Javellins for example.

Vitals Shot: The warrior is adept at shooting where it hurts the
most. He adds +1 to rolls on the Critical Wound effect chart when
using ranged attacks.

Fletcher: The warrior makes his own arrows. When shooting a bow,
his arrows are +1 to rolls on the Injury Chart.
Heavy Pull: The warrior has trained to use a bow with a heavier
draw. All attacks made by the warrior with a bow are at +1 Strength.


#### Academic Skills

Battle Tongue: This skill may only be chosen by a leader. The
warrior has drilled his warband to follow short barked commands.
This increases the range of his Leader ability by 6". Note that
Undead leaders may not use this skill.

Sorcery: This skill may only be taken by Heroes that is a Magic
User. A warrior with this skill gains +1 to his rolls to see whether he
can cast spells successfully or not. Note that Pray Users may not use
this skill.

Streetwise: A warrior with this skill has good contacts and knows
where to purchase rare items. He may add +2 to the roll that
determines his chances of finding such items (see the Trading
section).

Haggle: The warrior knows all the tricks of bargaining and
haggling. He may deduct 2D6 gold crowns from the price of any
single item (to a minimum cost of 1gc) once per post battle
sequence.

Warrior Wizard: This skill may only be taken by Magic Users. 
The mental powers of the wizard allow him to wear armor
and cast spells.

Scribe: The warrior is a natural adept at writing and making scrolls.
Any warrior with the ability to cast spells or use prayers may take
this skill. It allows them to make a scroll before the battle and
inscribe a single spell or prayer upon it that they are versed in. The
scroll may be used just before they are about to cast the spell or
prayer and allows the caster +2 to his difficulty roll. Once used the
scroll will crumble to dust and is useless. Scrolls may not be saved
up from battle to battle if they are not used.

Mind Focus: The warrior possesses a great strength of mind which
allows him to concentrate beyond the levels of most normal men.
This skill may only be taken by a be taken by Magic / Pray Users.
When using a spell or prayer the warrior with this skill may reroll
one dice roll used in the difficulty roll.

Tactician: This skill may only be taken by a warband leader. The
warrior has a great tactical mind and can often find the best
positions for his warriors to meet the oncoming attack. In any scenario
the player may deploy their Warband 4" further onto the board than usual.

Hunch: This skill may only be taken by the warband leader. The
warrior has an uncanny knack of placing their men in the right place
at the right time, as if they sense danger through instinct alone. The warband
leader may position up to 3 of their Warriors capable of earning experience 
in any building on the board that is atleast 12 inch away from an enemy 
model and not in the enemy deployment zone.

Magical Aptitude: This skill may only be taken by a Magic User. It
may not be used by pray-users. The warrior has a keep aptitude for
magic and can push themself beyond normal limits to produce a
storm of spells, allowing them to cast twice per turn. After attempting the
first spell, they must take a toughness test. If they pass they may attempt
a second spell that turn or even cast the same spell twice. If they fail
they must roll on the injury table immediately with no saves treating
Out Of Action results as Stunned instead.

Drive Chariot: Taking this skill will allow a Hero ride a Chariot.

#### Strength Skills

Mighty Blow: The warrior knows how to use his strength to
maximum effect and has a +1 Strength bonus in close combat. 

Pit Fighter: The warrior has learned how to fight in enclosed spaces
from their time in the dangerous fighting pits of the Empire. They are an
expert at fighting in confined areas and adds +1WS and +1A Attacks if they
are fighting inside buildings or ruins. It’s a good idea
to define which bits of your terrain collection count as ‘buildings or
ruins’ at the start of a battle to avoid confusion later.

Resilient: The warrior is covered in battle scars. They gain +1 Toughness
against attacks made in close combat. Does not effect being shot with pistols.

Fearsome: Such is the reputation and physique of the model that he
causes fear in opposing models.

Strongman: The warrior is capable of great feats of strength. He
may use a double-handed weapon without the usual penalty of
always striking last. Work out order of battle as you would with
other weapons.

Bell Ringer: 1 Attack Only, +1 to hit, +1 S, no Weapon Bonuses,
foe Stunned on a 2-5 on Injury Chart.

Untiring: When wielding Flails and Morning Stars, the Hero may
use the Strength Bonuses every Hand-to-Hand phase of the game,
not just the first round of a Hand-to-Hand engagement. (Created by
Jester.)

Strong Legs: The Hero may use Heavy Armor and a Shield
without suffering Movement penalties.

Beastmaster: If the model confronts an animal (not mount!) in hand-to- 
hand combat, then before combat is fought they may take a Ld test. If the
test is successful then the animal falls under their command. The animal then
come under control of the Beastmaster's warband. Control of the animal is immediately
lost if the Beastmaster either moves more than 8" away ir is _incapacitated_.

#### Speed Skills

Leap: The warrior may leap D6" in the movement phase in addition
to his normal movement. He may move and leap, run and leap, or
charge and leap, but he can only leap once per turn.
A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models,
including enemies, and obstacles 1" high, without penalty.
The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you
must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice
to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he
falls through the gap (see page 6).

Sprint: The warrior may triple his Movement rate when he runs or
charges, rather than doubling it as normal.
Acrobat: The warrior is incredibly supple and agile. He may fall or
jump from a height of up to 12" without taking any damage if he
passes a single Initiative test, and can re-roll failed Diving Charge
rolls. 

Lightning Reflexes: The Warrior negates the 'strikes first' bonus of
any model that charges them.

Get Down Mister President!: Sometimes you've got to put your own life on
the line to protect your leaders. Exactly how one would perform an Intercept
to block a charging foe, a Warrior with this skill may perform an Intercept
to move into the path of a missile or Magic Missile that would hit an ally.
The Warrior must pass a Leadership test in order to perform this manouvre, but 
if successful they will move into the path of the projectile and take the hit
instead of the intended target. Damage is then resolved normally.

Jump Up: The warrior can regain his footing in an instant,
springing to his feet immediately if he is Knocked Down. The
warrior may ignore Knocked Down results when rolling for injuries,
unless he is Knocked Down because of a successful save from
wearing a helmet or because he has the No Pain special rule.
Dodge: A warrior with this skill is nimble and as fast as quicksilver.
They gain a 5+ Ward Save against all missiles and Magic Missiles.

Scale Sheer Surfaces: A warrior with this skill can scale even the
highest wall or fence with ease. They no longer require Initiative tests
for climbing. (Jumping down still requires them).

Roll Dodge: The warrior can ignore the 2" Interception rule when
charging in to Hand-to-Hand combat.

Fleet Footed: The warrior gains +1 to his base Movement.



#### Assassin Special Skills

Backstabber: The assassin specializes in attacking his targets when
their back is turned. If The Assassin charges a foe from outside of line
of sight (therefore needing an Initiative Test to do so) they surprise their opponent
and receive a +1 to hit with all attacks and any Injury Rolls are at +1.
This bonus lasts for the first round of combat only, as their opponent will 
swiftly recover their wits if they survive the initial assault.

Silent Takedown: If an Assassin manages to _incapacitate_ a target within the same
round of combat as they charged it they may make an immediate free movement of up to
2". Assuming this movement would put them into a position to do so, they may then
go into hiding. This move may not take them into combat with a new enemy.

Opportunistic Killer: An assassin's preferred foe is an oblivious one. If an
assassin completes a diving charge against an unengaged foe they gain the 
_Killing Blow_ special rule for that round of combat.

Master of Poisons: The assassin is a master in brewing up different
poisons. If the hero does not search for rare items, they may
brew up D3-1 portions of either dark venom or black lotus. It may come up
empty, but those are the hazards of trying these intricate things
on the move. The portions are large enough for one weapon and
need to be used for the next battle as they are less stable then
normally purchased poisons.

Master of Disguise: Paranoia is rewarded in Mordheim, and warriors quickly
learn to watch the shadows and remember to look up. In the chaos of a skirmish
innovative thinking can even turn a direct assault into a surprise! Before the 
start of a game the Assassin's owner may choose to have the Assassin replace a
henchman in either their own or a Formal Ally's warbands. Secretly make a note
of which henchman has been replaced. The disguised assassin gains the equipment 
and stats of that henchman until they are revealed. An assassin is automatically 
revealed if they are charged, or they be revealed at the start of their owning
player's turn. Once an assassin is revealed they immediately recover their own gear 
and behave as normal. Assassins may not disguise themselves as Monstrous Infantry,
no amount of low-brimmed hats and hunching will make an Elf look like a convincing Ogre.

Hitman: The Assassin is a master of acting natural and hiding in plain 
sight, allowing them to go into Hiding even if in the open and in line of sight of
an enemy. This ability ceases to work for the rest of the battle if the
assassin attacks an enemy or attempts to pick up loot.

Infiltration: The Assassin with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.

#### Beastmen Raiders Special Skills

Shaggy Hide: The Beastman’s massively shaggy hide acts as
armor, deflecting sword strokes and protecting him from harm. The
model gains a 6+ Armor Save that can be combined with other
armor as normal.
Mutant: The Beastman may buy one mutation.
Fearless: Immune to Fear and All Alone tests.
Giant Horns: The Beastman gains Impact Hits (1)
Bellowing Roar: Only the Beastman Chief may have this skill. He
may re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Manhater: Will be affected by the rules of Hatred when fighting
any Human warbands.
Oppression: Beastmen henchmen within 8" of a Hero with this skill
will not have to test for Infighting.
Violent: The Hero now suffers from Infighting!

#### Blessings of Nurgle

Those that worship at the fetid altar of the Lord of Decay suffer
from terrible diseases and decay, which are known as Blessings of
Nurgle.
Blessings of Nurgle may be bought for Tainted Ones only when
they are recruited; you may not buy new Blessings for a model after
recruitment. Any Tainted may have one or more Blessings. The first

flame template and is resolved at Strength 2 with no saves for armor.

#### Blood Dragon’s Bloodline Abilities

Red Fury: The vampire falls in a horrible blood-rage, unstoppable
for his enemies. He gains one additional Attack to his profile.
Killing Blow: The vampire is an expert fighter and every time he
rolls a natural 6 on the to-hit roll, he automatically wounds his
opponent. No parries are allowed, although the opponent may make
armor or saving throws.
Challenger: The vampire really doesn't put much effort into fighting
the peasants and chaff. Only heroes are worth his time! The vampire 
re-rolls failed 'to hit' rolls against heroes.
Curse Of The Undead: The vampire is one of the ever-living and is
extraordinarily difficult to kill. The vampire has 5+ ward save in
addition to all his armor-rolls and parries.

heavy armor and shield.

Action, Stunned or Knocked Down, you may re-roll a failed Rout
Test
Virtue of Noble Disdain: The Knight is subject to Hatred of all
enemies armed with shooting weapons.
Virtue of the Impetuous: The Knight gains an additional +D3" to
his move when charging. Roll the dice each time you wish to charge
and before moving the model.

#### Cavalry Skills


Cavalry Commander. Mounted heroes are an impressive sight.
With a good vantage point, they can see (and be seen) far more
readily than if they were on foot. If the warband's leader has this
skill and is mounted, he may add an extra 6" to the distance within
which other warriors in the warband may use his Leadership. This is
in addition to any other bonuses that increase the range of the
leader’s influence.
Trick Riding. By athletically hanging off the side of his mount, a
rider makes himself harder to hit. While a rider is trick riding all
missile attacks against him suffer -1 to hit in addition to other
modifiers. The rider must declare that he is trick riding before
moving. He must then make an initiative test and if successful may
move full distance. If he fails he loses control of his mount and must
roll immediately on the Whoa Boy! Table. 
Combat Riding. The rider has trained his mount to use its bulk to
trample any unmounted enemy before him. The mount of a warrior with
this skill gains Impact Hits (1) against Infantry, Swarms, and War Beasts.
Evade. The rider has trained his mount to swerve from side to side
in combat, wrong footing his opponent. A rider with this skill
always strikes first in close combat against dismounted opponents.
When charged by an opponent, or otherwise fighting an enemy also
entitled to strike first, attacks are carried out in order of Initiative. If
Initiative is equal, the model with greater experience strikes first.
Running Dismount. The rider is able to dismount from his mount
at speed. The rider may ride up to the mount’s normal move
distance and then dismount immediately. No further movement or
shooting is possible. This skill may be used to move into contact
with the enemy, counting as a Diving Charge from a height of 2" –
all usual rules for diving charges apply. Note that the rider then
counts as dismounted, gaining no further assistance from his mount.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.
Athletic Mount. Without breaking stride, the warrior is able to leap
onto the back of his mount and immediately spur it into a full gallop.
Once the warrior is aboard, the mount may make a run or charge
move as normal. The warrior must be within 2" of his steed to use
this skill.
Mounted Combat Master. The rider is especially skilled at combat
against a mounted opponent. The model may re-roll failed 'to hit' rolls
in combat against mounted opponents.

#### Clan Eshin Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Art of Silent Death: The Skaven has patiently mastered the deadly
art of open-hand fighting, as taught by the mystics of Cathay in the
temples of the far East. In hand-to-hand combat, the Skaven can
fight with his bare paws without any penalties and counts as having
two weapons (i.e., +1 attack). In addition, a Skaven Hero with this
skill will cause a critical hit on a To Wound roll of 5-6 instead of
just 6. This skill may be used in conjunction with the Eshin Fighting
Claws (+2 Attacks instead of +1).
Play Dead: Sometimes strange things happen when people have the
misfortune of running into Skaven. A clearly dead corpse is not
there anymore after the fight is over, or dropped weapons or
treasures have disappeared. As well as being taught to roll with the
blows, these characters are taught to feign death. When avoiding the
full effects of a potentially lethal blow they play dead so they can
escape undetected later. The character may re-roll a result on the
serious injury table.

#### Clan Moulder Special Skill

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The

the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.

with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Beast Master: Any animals (giant rats, rat wolves, and rat ogres) in
the same warband as the Skaven with this skill are treated as having
a +1 bonus to their Leadership.

strengthened until is a frightening addition to his physical makeup.
He may grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks
by –1, down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which
attack his opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns.


#### Clan Pestilens Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Censer Bearer: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Black
Hunger special skill may choose the Censer Bearer special skill. A
Clan Pestilens member with this skill is called Censer Bearer. He
gains the special rule Frenzy and the only weapon he may use in
close combat is a censer.
Contagious: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Rotten Body
special skill may choose the Contagious special skill. A model who
inflicts an injury in close combat that send the contagious member
of the Clan Pestilens out of combat must take a Toughness test. Roll
a D6. If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking
the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always
inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this
test.
Diseased Visage: The follower of the Plagued Ones with this
attribute has obtained a body and face covered in oozing sores and
legions so horrible, that the model causes fear.
Ignore Pain: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Resilient
strength skill may choose the Ignore Pain special skill. A Clan
Pestilens member with this skill treats "Stunned" injuries as
"Knocked Down".
Rotten Body: A Clan Pestilens member with this skill has grown
accustomed to poisons, diseases and the fog of death emanated by
censers. He is now immune to poisons and diseases and, if taken out
of combat because of a failed test for wielding a censer, he will not
have to roll for injuries at the end of the battle, recovering
automatically.
Unholy Chant: Once per battle, the model with this skill may start
an Unholy Chant. This chant causes all Skaven in the warband to
immediately pass all Leadership-based tests in the turn the chant is
uttered, including Rout tests.

#### Clan Skryre Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no

on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and

up first.
Excellent Engineer: The Skryre Engineer with this skill is
constantly working on the black powder and Warplock weapons of
the warband. Any black powder or Warplock weapons owned by the
Skaven in the warband have their range increased by +6”.
Warp Magic (magic user only): The Skaven may now uses magic
from the any Skaven magic list or Lesser Magic List.

#### Dark Elf Special Skills

Draich Master: The hero has chosen the aspect of the Executioner
as his primary focus. The hero can wield a double-handed sword
without the usual penalty of striking last, and is allowed to wear
Heavy or Ithilmar armor (note that he may not wear Gromril
armor; what kind of Elf would wear Dwarf-made armor,
anyways?). [Skill by Julian Hellstrom]
Fey Quickness: Few can ever hope to match an Elf ’s inhuman
quickness and agility. An Elf with Fey Quickness can avoid melee
or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the Elf also has Step Aside or
Dodge this will increase to a 4+ in the relevant area. For example,
an Elf with Fey Quickness and Step Aside avoids melee attacks on a
4+ and missile attacks on a 6.
Infiltration: The Dark Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Master of Poisons: The Dark Elf is proficient in concocting
different poisons. If the Hero doesn’t search for rare items, he may
make D3-1 doses of Dark Venom instead. There is a chance of
getting none, as the hero doesn’t have access to a stable workplace.
The poison must be used in the next battle and cannot be sold or
traded to other warbands as the Dark Elves guard their secrets very
carefully.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf and is
capable of feats of strength. A warrior with this skill may choose
skills from the Strength table. The Sorceress may never take this
skill and no more than two warriors in the warband may take this
skill at any one time.
Murderer: The Dark Elf may always choose to attack _incapacitated_ 
foes even if there are standing foes in combat with them.


#### Dwarf Special Skills

Master of Blades: This Dwarf’s martial skills surpass those of a
normal warrior; he has fought unscathed against hordes of Orcs and
Goblins. When using a weapon that has a Parry special rule, this
hero parries successfully if he beats or matches his opponents
highest ‘to hit’ roll, not just if he beats the roll. In addition, if this
warrior is using two weapons that have the Parry special rule, he is
allowed to parry two attacks (if his two dice match or beat the two
highest Attack dice against him) instead of the normal maximum of
one. Note that if this Dwarf has two Dwarf axes (as detailed above)
he can re-roll any failed parries.
Extra Tough: This Dwarf is notorious for walking away from
wounds that would kill a lesser being. When rolling on the Heroes
Serious Injury chart for this Hero after a game in which he has been
taken Out Of Action, the dice may be re-rolled once. The result of
this second dice roll must be accepted, even if it is a worse result.
Resource Hunter: This Dwarf is especially good at locating
valuable resources. When rolling on the Exploration chart at the end
of a game, the Hero may modify one dice roll by +1/-1.
True Grit: Dwarfs are hardy individuals and this Hero is hardy
even for a Dwarf! When rolling on the Injury table for this Hero, a
roll of 1-3 is treated as Knocked Down, 4-5 as Stunned, and 6 as Out
Of Action.
Thick Skull: The Hero has a thick skull, even for a Dwarf. He has a
3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made, treat a
Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Dwarf also wears a
helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of the
normal Helmet special rule).


#### Halfling Special Skills

Quiet as a Mouse: The Halfling as adept at staying as quiet as a
mouse whilst hiding. Enemy warriors must use half their initiative
value in inches (rounded down) when trying to detect this hidden
Halfling.
Crude Belch: Having eaten a meal or six, this Halfling may release
a withering belch to distract his enemies. During the first round of
hand to hand combat the Halfling can release his noxious fumes
upon all enemies within base contact. All enemies affected must
take a leadership test. If the leadership test is failed then the putrid
odour has severely affected the warrior's fighting ability and he must
miss his first attack (regardless of whether he has only one attack or
not).
Skilled Huntsman: The Halfling has been hunting things ever since
he was young (the more food he has, the better!) and has become
well adapted to firing as silently and discreetly as possible. To
represent this a Halfling may try and fire a ranged weapon and
remain hidden. When shooting from hiding roll D6. On a 3+ the
Halfling has managed to keep his actions inconspicuous to the eye
of the enemy and may remain hidden that turn. Note this skill may
not be combined with black powder weapons, they are just too
noisy!
Layers of Fat: The Halfling has gained mountains of flab during his
vast experience of eating fine foods and his thick bulk could
swallow a sword whole! The Halfling always has a basic saving
throw of 6 regardless of the enemy warrior's strength and on top of
any armor he already wears.
Shifty: The Halfling has long-been skirting in the shadows,
avoiding unwanted attention. So nimble is he that he may surprise
even those who believe they've got them dead-to-rights. The
Halfling gains a bonus attack when charged that strikes first.
Wily Thief: If the Halfling takes any enemy out of action and
doesn’t go out of action himself, the warband gains an extra piece of
Wyrdstone (in addition to his Cutpurse piece. See Halfling thief)
Stealthy: The Halfling can hide even after running, and can run
while within 8” of the enemy.

#### Hobgoblin Special Skills

Charge Stoppa: A hobgoblin with this skill can deliver a huge
surprise to a charging opponent. When an opponent charges the
hobgoblin he can immediately make a free attack with a missile
weapon. If the hobgoblin’s strike causes him an injury, the attacker
is stopped halfway through his charge. For example, if the charge
would have been 8”, the hobgoblin’s strike would stop the attacker
at 4 inches. Unfortunately for the hobgoblin, if his assailant does
succeed in his charge, the hobgoblin cannot use hand-to-hand
combat weapons during that round. He can use his fist however.
Ded Shooty: Hobgoblins are famed masters of the bow, and their
steady aim allows them to fire with uncanny accuracy while on the
move. This skill allows a hobgoblin to ignore movement penalties
when shooting. Hobgoblins riding giant wolves can use this skill as
well, suffering no penalties to movement while firing from
wolfback.
Ded Sneaky: These sneaky hobgoblins have been trained as scouts,
sneaking up close to the enemy to deliver a deadly strike or observe
the enemy positions for their leaders. A hobgoblin with this skill is
placed after all other models have been placed. He can be placed
anywhere on the table, as long as he’s at least 12” from any
opponent’s models.
Backstabba: The hobgoblins are a tricky breed, and take advantage
of any opportunity in combat. A hobgoblin with this skill can make
a surprise attack on his opponent from a direction he isn’t expecting.
The attack is in addition to the hobgoblin’s normal attacks, but
cannot be parried.

#### Kislev Ranger Skills

Animal Call: If hidden, the Ranger may use animal calls to
confound the enemies. Any enemy model that is within 18” of the
Ranger and does not declare a charge in its movement phase must
take a Leadership test (determine which models these are after
charges are declared but before they are moved). Those that fail the
Ranger may move in any direction she wishes instead of their
normal move.
Herb Lore: The Ranger has learned basic herb lore to cure injuries.
Any friendly model in base-to-base contact with her may have 1
wound restored on a roll of 4+ in the recovery phase. The ranger
may also heal herself. If any healing is successful, the ranger may
not move this turn, but may shoot as normal. The ranger may not
heal if she is in close combat.

#### Lahmia Special Skills

Swift: when moving the vampire may run but counts as having
moved normally for all purposes.
Transfix: at the start of the combat phase, one enemy model in base
contact must test against Leadership. If the test is failed, the model
may not attack that turn and all attacks against it gain an additional
+1 to hit. Ineffective against models immune to psychology.
Quickblood: the vampire's lightning reflexes give it an
unmodifiable 6+ save against all wounds. This save is in addition to
and taken before normal armor saves. Note that in the case of
critical hits this save is taken before rolling to see if multiple
wounds are taken. If the vampire acquires Dodge or Step Aside,
those skills supercede this one and cannot be combined to produce a
4+ save. Hence, a vampire with Quickblood and Dodge has a 5+
save against missiles and 6+ against close combat.
Innocence Lost: the vampire's ability to appear virginal and
innocent temporarily disarms her opponent. The vampire always
attacks first in close combat. If an enemy model also has the ability
to attack first, then decide in order of initiative. In case of equal
initiative, the highest score on 1d6 goes first. This skill is ineffective
against models immune to psychology.
Seduction: The vampire must test against Leadership at the start of
the combat phase. If successful, one enemy model in base contact
must also save against Leadership. If failed, the model is controlled
by the vampire player. The model's original owner may attempt to
regain control in each subsequent turn by testing again in his
recovery phase. If the vampire chooses to attack the controlled
model, control is lost immediately. If the model ends the game
under vampire control, they count as out of action. A maximum of
one model may be so controlled. Ineffective against models immune
to psychology.
Night Creature: the vampire blends effortlessly into the
background. Models wishing to charge, shoot or cast spells at the
vampire must roll 4+ to do so, or choose another target. This skill is
only effective if the vampire did not move in its previous movement
phase.


#### Marks of Chaos

Mark of Chaos Undivided: Models with the Mark of Chaos Undivided
gain +1 Leadership. This may take them above 10.

Mark of Khorne: Heroes bearing the Mark of Khorne gain Frenzy, and a 5+
ward save against the effects of spells. A Warband containing one or more
of this mark may never form Formal Alliances.

Mark of Nurgle: The Model gains +1 Toughness, +1 Wound, but loses
1 point of Movement and 1 point of Initiative. They are now 
immune to poison and the effects of Plague Victims. These bonuses also
apply to any War Beast or Monstrous Mount the rider may have, though 
it will lose 2 points of movement rather than 1 as it has to contend with
its own decrepitude as well as the increased weight of its rider.

Mark of Slaanesh: Enemy models that wish to charge a character with the
Mark of Slaanesh must first pass a successful Leadership test or 
the charge is failed. Enemies are additionally at -1 to hit in melee.
The character gains Stupidity.

Mark of Tzeentch: The hero immediately learns all spells from Chaos
Rituals and may cast spells in armour. Any roll of a double will miscast.

#### Musicians Skills


Minstrel: The musician is a masterful taleteller and gains extra
income for the warband. If the Musician was not taken out of action they
may earn an additional 2d6 gold after the game.

Fighting Songs: The musician has in his selection of songs many a
fighting ballad. These ballads dispel fear. Any musician with this
ability sings in battle emboldening the troops. Any friendly troop
within 12” does not suffer from fear or all alone tests.

Rally!: Even the most crestfallen Warriors will take heart when gathered
around a motivated and uplifting bard. For every allied Warrior whose
loss would contribute to rout theshold within 6" of the Musician with
Rally the owning player may add +1 to their warband's leadership for
the purposes of rout tests.

Marching Tune: If the Musician forms a unit with five or more allies they
may all add 1 to their base movement as long as they stay together. 

Deafening racket: A musician may choose to make a deafening racket in
each of their shooting phases. If they choose to do so then until their
next shooting phase (so yes, this may even cause the musician's warband to
be more likely to rout) all non-Musicians within 8" reduce their Leadership 
by 1.



#### Mutations

Those who dwell in Mordheim soon develop horrible mutations, and
the Cult of the Possessed seem to be especially susceptible. In
addition, Mordheim attracts mutants from all over the Empire, who
are always quick to join the Chaos covens. Most mutations are
simply inconvenient or hideous, but some make their bearers
extremely dangerous in combat.
Mutations may be bought for a Mutant or a Possessed warrior only
when they are recruited; you may not buy new mutations for a
model after recruitment. Any Mutant or Possessed may have one or
more mutations. The first mutation is bought at the price indicated,
but second and subsequent mutations bought for the same model
cost double.
Daemon soul: A Daemon lives within the mutant’s soul. This gives
him a 4+ save against the effects of spells or prayers.
Cost: 20 gold crowns.
Great claw: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
Cost: 50 gold crowns.
Cloven hoofs: The warrior gains +1 Movement.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Tentacle: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical hits)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
Cost: 30 gold crowns
Spines: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Scorpion tail: The mutant has a long barbed tail with a venomed
tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each hand-to-
hand combat phase. If the model hit by the tail is immune to poison,
the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Extra arm: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in the
extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or a buckler in the extra
arm. If a Possessed chooses to do this, he gains an extra attack but
still cannot carry a weapon.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Hideous: The mutant causes fear. See the Psychology section for
details.
Cost: 40 gold crowns


#### Norse Special Skill

Shield Master: Norse warriors begin training with shields when
they are still children. Some warriors become so skilled with these
weapons that they can block almost any blow against them. When
this hero is armed with a shield he may parry with it in addition to
getting a 6+ save.
Berserk Charge: The Norse are very skilled with weapons that
many other races see as primitive and savage. When this hero is
armed with an axe or double handed weapon, he may re-roll all
failed to hit rolls when he charges.
Crushing Blow: Norse warriors train in almost all of their spare
time. They are expert fighters and learn to put all of their strength
into very powerful attacks. No enemy may parry an attack made by
this hero because it strikes with such power that it pushes right
through a buckler or sword.
Battle Tongue: Only a hero with the leader skill may gain this skill.
It allows models within 12" of him use his leadership, rather than
the normal 6".
Barbarian Courage: As Norse warriors strive to die bravely in
battle, they learn to fear nothing and embrace hardship. This hero
never needs to take all alone tests and may re-roll failed fear tests.

#### Orcs Special Skills

’ard ead: The warrior has a thick skull even for an Orc. He has a
special 3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made,
treat a Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Orc also
wears a helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of
the normal helmet special rule).
Waaagh!: Orcs are aggressive creatures and some are experts at
bulldozing charges. The warrior may add +D3" to his charge range.
’ere we go!: Orcs often charge even the most fearsome opponents.
The model may ignore Fear and Terror tests when charging.
da cunnin’ plan: Only the Boss may have this skill. The warband
may re-roll any failed Rout tests as long as the Boss is not Out Of
Action.
well ’ard (Greenskin warband only): The Orc has a thick, dark-
green skin, possibly indicating Black Orc blood. Such is the
toughness of the Orc that he may add +1 to any armor saves.
Proven Warrior (Black Orc Warband only): This young warrior
has proven himself worthy of his Black Orc heritage. This skill may
only be taken by a Young’un with the Black Orc blood ability and
25 experience. Once he gains this skill, the model is now considered
a full Black Orc Warrior (yet still retains the title of Young’un). He
follows all the rules for Black Orcs and uses their equipment list and
has access to the same skill lists as a Black Orc.
’eadbasher: Orcs have massive physical strength and some of them
even learn to aim their blows at the heads of their opponents, with
obvious results. Any Knocked Down results which the Orc causes in
hand-to-hand count as Stunned results instead.

#### Ostlanders Special Skills

Bull Rush: This warrior is huge, even by Ostlander standards, and
can use his massive girth to overpower his opponents. When he
charges, this Hero may attempt to knock down his opponent rather
than making his normal attacks. Roll to hit once with a +1 to hit
modifier, though no ‘to wound’ roll is necessary. Instead, if the
warrior hits with this attack, the opposing model is Knocked Down.
(Models with the Bull Rush skill should have a suitably large beer-
belly modeled out of putty whenever possible.)
Foul Odor: Ostlanders are one and all prodigious drinkers and none
too hygienic! This warrior rises head and shoulders above the rest.
After a lifetime of drinking, liquor has little effect on him any
more... not that this stops him from consuming massive quantities!
His unwashed clothes and sweat reek of alcohol and all living
enemies (not Undead or Possessed) are at -1 to hit him in hand-to-
hand combat. In addition, the warrior cannot carry any open flames
(torch, lantern, etc.) and fire attacks made against him are resolved
at +1 Strength as his beer soaked clothing burns readily.
Taunt: After years of baiting opponents into drunken brawls the
Ostlander has learned some of most vile insults in the Empire.
During the shooting phase the warrior may choose to taunt one
enemy instead of shooting with a missile weapon or casting a spell.
The warrior must be able to see the enemy and taunting follows all
the LOS rules for shooting (you must taunt the nearest opponent,
etc.). The player should insult the enemy model in some manner
whenever possible (perhaps his hat looks like a strangled parrot or
his mother was a Bretonnian.). The enemy then takes a Leadership
test. If he passes, nothing happens but if he fails he must spend his
next movement phase trying to get into close combat with the
warrior who taunted him.
Animal Friendship: Having grown up amidst the animals of the
forest this warrior exudes a certain charm to all ‘normal’ animals
(i.e. warhorses, Warhounds, etc.). Animals will never attack him and
up to two War dogs (see Mordheim book, page 54) that the warrior
owns do not count against the maximum number of models in the
Warband.
Blood Oath: The leader of an Ostlander Warband sometimes takes
a Blood Oath never to leave any of his fallen ‘family’ members
behind. Such is his determination to protect his fallen Blood-kin that
it is extremely difficult to cause him to Rout from the field. Only a
Warband’s leader may have this skill, which allows him to re-roll a
single Rout test once per game.


#### Pit Fighters Special Skills

Force of Will: When the Pit Fighter loses his last wound and is
taken OOA, he must roll a D6 equal or under his Toughness, each
following round he has to roll again on his toughness but then with a
-1 modifier for each subsequent round. If he succeeds he gets up and
may continue to fight, when he gets taken Out -of-Action a second
time he’ll be removed as normal.
Arms master: The Pit Fighter may now ignore all ‘difficult to use’
rules for all weapons, this enables him to combine certain types of
weapons, he can combine a Morning Star with buckler, or even a
Morning Star with a Morning Star.
Body Slam: Instead of making a normal charge the Pit Fighter may
attempt to slam his opponent to the ground, he burrows his shoulder
deep into his opponent’s stomach. Instead of making his normal
attacks the Pit fighter may make a single attack resolved as
following: +1Str, +1 to Hit, no weapon bonuses or abilities. Critical
hit on a 5+.
Grizzled Veteran: The Pit Fighter is used to fighting fearsome
monsters and being cornered in the Pit when there's no escape. He
has been close to death so many times that he has made his peace
and the thought of Death no longer bothers him. The Pit Fighter is
immune to all psychology.


#### Sisters of Sigmar Special Skills

Sign of Sigmar: The Sister is favoured by the great god Sigmar.
Possessed or Undead opponents lose their first attack against the
Priestess in the first round of hand-to-hand combat (down to a
minimum of 1).
Protection of Sigmar: The Sister has been blessed by the High
Matriarch. Any spell which would affect her is nullified on a D6 roll
of 4+. Note that if the spell is nullified it will not affect any other
models either.
Utter Determination: Only the Matriarch may have this skill,
which allows her to re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Righteous Fury: The Sister feels cold fury and utter contempt
towards any evil that pollutes the soil of the holy Empire with its
presence. The model hates all Skaven, Undead or Possessed
warbands and all models in them.
Absolute Faith: The Sister puts her faith in Sigmar, and faces
dangers unflinchingly. She may re-roll any Fear tests and does not
have to test if she is fighting alone against several opponents.

#### Shadow Warrior Special Skills

Infiltration: A Shadow Warrior with this skill is always placed on
the battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed
anywhere on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing
warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both
players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the
lowest roll sets up first.
See in Shadows: The warrior’s senses have become especially keen
from years spent walking the shadows. As long as he has movement
to reach them, the warrior may always roll to charge opponents he
cannot see (instead of the normal 4").
Hide in Shadows: Over time Shadow Warriors have learned how to
freeze in place and remain undetected, even from the heightened
senses of their Dark Elf cousins. An enemy warrior attempting to
detect this warrior when he is Hidden must halve his Initiative
before measuring the distance.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf, and is
capable of feats of strength not often seen among the people of
Ulthuan. A warrior with this skill may choose skills from the
Strength skills table from now on. This skill may not be taken by
Shadow Weavers. There may never be more than two Elves with
this skill in the warband at any one time.
Master of Runes: The Shadow Weaver has learned to harness the
power of the High Elven runes of power (see Elven Runestones,
below) to a degree few mages attain. When using Elven Runestones,
the mage is +1 to his dispel roll. In addition, the mage can inscribe
the weapons and armor of one of his fellow warriors with Elven
runes. One member of the Warband may re-roll a single failed
armor save or Parry roll once per battle. After a single battle, the
runes lose their glamour and must be redone. This skill may only be
taken by Shadow Weavers.


#### Troll Slayer Special Skills

Ferocious Charge: The Slayer may double his attacks on the turn
that he charges. He will suffer a -1 to hit penalty on that turn.
Monster Slayer: The Slayer always wounds any opponent on a roll
of 4+, regardless of Toughness, unless his own Strength (after all
modifiers due to weapon bonuses, etc) would mean that a lower roll
than this is needed.
Berserker: The Slayer may add +1 to his close combat to hit rolls
during the turn which he charges. (may not be used with Ferocious
Charge).
Sweeping strike: The slayer may make get an extra attack for each
enemy model in base contact, if he is engaged by more than 1
model, up to a total of ten attacks.
Tattoos of Grimnir: The Slayer is tattooed by one of the Priests of
Grimnir the Brave, the God of Slayers. The model now has a 6+
ward save. You may take this skill again increased to 5+ and so on,
up to 3+. (The Slayer is then covered in tattoos!).
Fated: The Slayer is destined not to die easily. You may re-roll any
result on the Serious Injury table. The second result stands, even if it
is worse than the first one.

#### Von Carstein Special Skills

Transfixing Glare: The Vampire is able to hypnotize a victim using
his glowing red eyes, the victim will remain passive and wait for the
Vampire to close. The Glare may be used on any living model in
base contact that is not Immune to Psychology. The victim must
pass a Leadership test on a 2D6 or be transfixed. A transfixed model
may not attack in close combat and is treated as being Knocked
Down for purpose of being attacked. Roll for the Glare at the start of
the combat phase.
Mist Form: A Vampire's human form is only one of many and a
few can transform into a thin mist in the recovery phase. While in
this state the Vampire has a move of 2D6" per turn. He may not
attack in close combat, shoot with a missile weapon or cast spells
and he gains no protection from armor. All to hit rolls against the
Vampire need a natural '6' to hit and all to wound rolls need a
natural '6 '. Note that this may not be modified by any bonuses as it
represents the protection of a non-physical form. The Vampire may
reduce the injury roll by -2. If the Vampire is Knocked Down he
immediately reverts to his physical form. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form in any subsequent recovery phase by choice.
Ratswarm Form: Some Vampires hold a sway over nature and they
can transform into animals such as a wolf, a swarm of rats or a giant
bat. A Vampire can change form in the recovery phase regardless of
whether the Vampire is Knocked Down or Stunned but he suffers all
penalties for standing up for example. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form at the start of any subsequent recovery phase.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ratswarm Form 6 3 0 3 3 * * 4 *
While in Ratswarm form the Vampire may not use weapons and
does not receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot with a
missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat without
a penalty for fighting without a weapon. The Vampire should be
represented by a Ratswarm base but treat the Vampire as being the
size of a single rat for moving through alleys or similar small
spaces. The Vampire may move through small holes and gaps that
would allow a single rat-sized creature to pass through and can thus
move through walls as most have a small holes in them.
Bat Form: Many Vampires can transform into giant bats. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as detailed
above.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bat Form 8 3 0 3 2 * * 1 *
Whilst in Bat form the Vampire may fly and ignores movement
penalties, he cannot run as such but may move double distance and a
charge move is also doubled. The Vampire may not use weapons
and does not receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot
with a missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat
without a penalty for fighting without a weapon.
Wolf Form: Many Vampires can transform into Giant Wolves. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as described
above.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Wolf Form 9 4 0 4 3 * * 2 *
Whilst in Wolf form the Vampire may not use weapons and does not
receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot with a missile
weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat without a
penalty for fighting without a weapon.
Note: In Ratswarm, Bat or Wolf Form for the * Use the same
characteristics as the Vampire



#### Wardancer Skill List

Aerial Fury: Instead of making a normal charge the Wardancer
may use the Aerial Fury skill. If the Wardancer passes an initiative
test he may jump into combat with the same effects as a diving
charge. This attack can be made from ground level and does not
have to be made from a higher position as per normal diving charge
as the Wardancer simply leap up and brings death to his foes from
above.
Blade Master: The Wardancer is a master of the dance and his skill
with his twin blades is legendary. This allows the Wardancer to use
his second blade to re-roll his parry attempt in the same way as a
buckler though still gaining a +1 attack bonus.
I Shall Fight: Who I Please - With this ability the Wardancer may
charge any enemy within range and line of sight regardless of
models intercepting. Opponent’s clumsy attempts to intercept the
Wardancer are easily dodged or even leapt over.
Ritual Trance: The Warrior puts himself into a ritual chance before
the battle begins. The warrior is utterly fearless and has an undying
lust for combat. The warrior is immune to all psychology.

#### Wood Elf Special Skills

Luck. The Wood Elf is blessed by Lileath, the Elven goddess of
luck. Once per game he may re-roll any dice roll he makes (but not
one made by other members of the warband).
Masterful Ricochet: Learning to ricochet arrows is a life's work for
even an Elven archer - but learning to do so within the contorted and
irregular shapes of Athel Loren is a whole new level of mastery. The range
of the Ricochet critical hit effect is increased to 12" and ignores line of
sight.
Fey protection: The flow of the forest of Athel Loren is a bit
stronger in this warrior and offer a degree of protection against the
winds of magic. The Elven warrior receives a Save of 4+ against the
effect of any magic that affects him or her.
Fey Quickness: Few mortal beings can ever hope it match an Elf ́s
quickness and agility. An Elven warrior with this skill can avoid
hand-to-hand combat or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the warrior
also has the Step Aside or Dodge skill this will increase the special
save to 4+ in the relevant area (IE a warrior with Step Aside avoids
hand-to-hand combat attacks on 4+ and missile attacks on 6+).
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Wood Elf, and
is capable of feats of strength not often seen among the Wood Elf. A
warrior with this skill may choose skills from the Strength skill table
from now on, in addition to his other skill tables. There may bever
be more than two Wood Elf with this skill in the warband at any one
time.
Infiltration: A Wood Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12” from any enemy model. The Scout may set up hidden
if you wish. If both players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6
for each, and the lowest roll sets up first.
Asrai Archery: The Wood Elf does not suffer -1 penalty for
moving and shooting.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Hide in Shadow: enemy attempting to detect a Wood Elf with this
skill must halve his inniative
Confused: Gains the Hatred rule of all Forest Spirits.

### Starting the game

#### Pre-battle sequence

Although you can simply decide with your opponent which
scenario you want to play, most players prefer to generate
their scenarios randomly. To do this, work your way through
the following sequence before the battle.
1 The player with the lowest warband rating rolls on the
Scenario table to determine which scenario is played. In the
scenarios where there is an attacker and a defender, the same
player may choose which he is.
2 Roll for warriors with old battle wounds to see whether
they can take part or not.
3 Set up the terrain and warbands according to the rules for
the scenario you are playing. The more buildings the better,
so you should place all the terrain you have.

#### Rules for playing multiplayer games

Size of playing area: Multiplayer Mordheim obviously
requires more room to play. While Mordheim normally plays
fine in a 4'x4' area, the size of the playing area for
multiplayer games should be at least 4'x6'. This is important
for set-up as detailed below.
Attackers and defenders: In scenarios where attackers and
defenders are defined, the defender is the player whose
warband has the highest rating. If more than one warband
have the same highest rating, the defender will be the one
among them whose warband includes the most models. If
there is still a tie, roll a dice to determine who gets to be the
defender. There is only ever one defender, all the other
warbands are the attackers.
Setting up the warbands: In scenarios where there is a
defender, that player sets up his warband first. To determine
who among the attacking warbands sets up next (or among all
the warbands in a scenario without defined attackers and
defenders), each player rolls a D6. The player with the
highest roll sets up next and the remaining players set up in
order of descending dice rolls.

When it is his turn to set up his warband, each player must
choose one segment of table edge (see the diagram above for
what constitutes a ‘segment’) and set up his warband within
6" of it. No player may start a member of his warband within
6" of a member of another warband.
Note that some scenarios will have special set-up rules
(usually for the defender) which are different from the above.
Any such variation will be noted in the rules for that scenario.
Order of play: After all warbands have been set up, players
must determine the order of play. Players should be arrayed
about the table by their set-up segment (see above). Each
player rolls a D6. The player with the highest roll gets the
first turn. Play proceeds clockwise around the table from
there.

Shooting into close combat: Unlike in the regular Mordheim
rules, it is possible to shoot into close combat in multiplayer
games, just as long as the shooters belong to a different
warband than the models involved in the Close Combat. Enemies in
a combat are not considered the closest enemy for the purposes
of being the closest target for shooting, though unless their combat
runs the risk of hitting your own allies you may target them anyway.
Randomise any missile hits between the
target and any models in close combat with him.
Close combat involving multiple warbands: In multiplayer
Mordheim it is quite possible that one warband member gets
charged by models from two or more opposing warbands.
When this occurs, a model will fight during the Close
Combat phase of each model it is fighting. This can give a
model many attacks during a cycle of player turns but any
model that has been ganged up on in this way is probably
done for in any case!
Routing warbands: Unlike normal games of Mordheim, one
warband failing its Rout test (or having all of its models
taken out of action) does not necessarily end the game.
Unless there are special victory conditions noted in the rules
for the scenario you are using, a multiplayer game will last
until there
is only one warband left on the table. The player whose
warband stays on the table for the longest is normally the
winner, though in some scenarios the winner might be the
warband leaving the table first, as it achieves its objective and
leaves the scene!
