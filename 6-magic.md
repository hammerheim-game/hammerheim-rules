There have always been those who have used magic: witches and wizards, wise women and warlocks. But as all scholars know, all magic is dangerous, for it originates from Chaos, the source of corruption and change. Indeed, during these times, sorcery is illegal and punishable by death. Wizards have little say in whether the world of magic touches them or not. They are born with second sight and to them the world of magical energies and spells is much more real than the mundane world of normal mortals. With all the persecution, fear and hatred it is little wonder that wizards become reclusive and suspicious, and many are downright insane. Some even turn to the worship of the dark gods, and others follow the forbidden path of necromancy. Mordheim has become home to many magic users and they roam the ruins hiding from Witch Hunters. But there are other ways of gaining power over and above that of a normal mortal man. The gods watch over their subjects and a priest of strong faith can call upon them to assist him in battle. Of these, the Priests of Sigmar are the most common, for Sigmar is the patron god of the Empire, and his following is strong during these times of strife.

Most wizards start with one randomly determined spell, but may gain more. Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart. If you get the same spell twice, roll again or lower the spell’s difficulty by 1. 

#### Casting spells

In order to cast a spell, the caster must roll 2D6. If they equal or exceed the casting value of the spell then the spell has succeeded! If their roll includes 2 or more 6's then the caster has casted with Irresistable force. Their spell may not be dispelled and after resolving it they must roll on the Miscast table in the Warhammer rulebook. Note that Prayers behave exactly like spells, except they do not miscast and may be used even when wearing armour.

There are several different types of spell, each behaving differently: 
 
Hex: Hex spells are malific enchantments that inflict some sort of negative status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any foe to be the target of a Hex as long as they are in line of sight.   

Augment: Augment spells are powerful enhancements that bestow some sort of positive status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any ally to be the target of an Augment as long as they are in line of sight. Note that many Augment spells only effect the caster.   

Direct Damage: Direct Damage spells are the term used for any magic that inflicts damage but is not necessarily a projectile. This might be a snap of the fingers causing an enemy to burst into flames for instance. Direct Damage spells may freely be targeted on any enemy as long as they are within line of sight.   

Magic Missile: Magic Missile spells tend to be more powerful than Direct Damage spells, or easier to cast. They represent streaming bolts of fire, or lightning lances that have to trace towards their target. Magic Missiles behave in the same way as Shooting attacks in every way, so may not be used against targets in combat or if the wizard themself is in combat.

\page

#### Damage

Some spells cause direct damage, and are resolved the same way as damage from shooting or blows in hand-to-hand combat. Models always receive armor saves against wounds caused by spells unless noted otherwise.

<div class='wide'>

##### Prayers of Sigmar

Those with great faith in the gods can call upon their divine power. The priests of Sigmar can pray for many miracles: healing of wounds, strengthening the resolve of their comrades or the banishment of Daemonic creatures and the Undead. The Prayers of Sigmar can be used by Witch Hunter Warrior Priests and Sigmarite Matriarchs. A warrior may use the divine power of Sigmar while wearing armor. Prayers of Sigmar are not regarded as spells, so any special protection against spells does not affect them.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | The Hammer of Sigmar | 7 | Augment | This weapon of the faithful glows with a golden light, imbued as it is with the righteous power of Sigmar. | he wielder gains +2 Strength in hand-to-hand combat and all hits he inflicts cause double damage (e.g., 2 wounds instead of 1). The Priest must test each shooting phase he wants to use the Hammer. |
| 2 | Hearts of Steel | 8 | Augment | Asaves of glory surround the servant of Sigmar, the faithful are heartened by the warrior god’s presence. Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear and All Alone tests. In addition, the whole warband gains +1 to any Rout tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, i.e., the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +1. |
| 3 | Soulfire | 9 | Direct | Purifying flames surround the Priest and wipe out those who resist the righteous fury of the God-Emperor! All enemy models within 4" of the servant of Sigmar suffer a Strength 3 hit. No armor saves are allowed. The servants of darkness and Chaos are especially susceptible to Sigmar’s holy power. Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead. |
| 4 | Shield of Faith | 6 | Augment | A shield of pure white light appears in front of the Priest. As long as his faith remains strong the shield will protect him. The Priest is immune to all spells. Roll at the beginning of each turn in the recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the shield disappears. |
| 5 | Healing Hand | 5 | Augment | Laying hands upon a wounded comrade, the servant of Sigmar calls upon his Lord to heal the warrior’s wounds. Any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2" are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal. |
| 6 | Armor of Righteousness | 9 | Augment | Impenetrable armor covers the Priest and the fiery image of a twin-tailed comet burns above his head. The Priest has an armor save of 2+ which replaces his normal armor save. In addition, he causes fear in his enemies and is therefore immune to fear himself. The power of the Armor of Righteousness lasts until the beginning of the Priest’s next Shooting phase. |

##### Prayers of Shallaya

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Regeneration | Auto | After the game the Priestess may Heal 1 serious Injury of any 1 Hero. Optionally, 1 Hero may reroll a 'Dead' result,  ignoring Robbed, Captured, Horrible Scars, and Sold to the Pits; |
| 2 | Heal |  5 | Restores a single unit (including self) to full wounds, Stunned models become knocked down, Knocked Down stand up: Range: 2". Note: If the priestess deliberately Heals an opponent, she gains an additional experience point. |
| 3 | Mass Heal | 7 | Restores 1 wound to all units within 2" of the priestess including enemies except true Undead and Possessed, whom it causes a wound to. Stunned models become knocked down, Knocked Down stand up: range: 2" radius |
| 4 | Antidote | 6 | Nullifies all effect of any poison or drug on any one model, friendly or enemy: Range: 12" |
| 5 | Helping Hands | 7 | Target stunned model instantly recovers their feet and may fight as normal in the ensuing Hand-to-Hand action. Range: 12" |
| 6 | Protection of Shayalla |  8 |The target model (may cast on self) gains a 4+ Unmodified save against any attack that causes a wound, in addition to any other save. The effect persists, but a roll must be made for the affected model during their own recovery phase; on a 1 or a 2 the effect fizzles. Range: 6" |

##### Prayers of Taal

Taal is the God of Nature and demands the respect of all those who enter the wild regions of the Empire. He is portrayed as a tall, broad-shouldered man with long wild hair and a thick beard. He wears a stag skull as a helm and is clothed in bison and bear skins. He is often called the Lord of Beasts. His followers include rangers, trappers and those who live in the wilds of the Empire.

Prayers of Taal work like the Prayers of Sigmar although the Taal Priest never wears armor.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Stag’s Leap | 7 | Many of Taal’s priests wear a stag skull as a symbol of their devotion and the Forest Lord’s power can be used to emulate the speed and beauty of this magnificent beast. The Priest of Taal may immediately move anywhere within 9", including into base-contact with the enemy, in which case he counts as charging and gains a +1 Strength to his first round of attacks. If he engages a fleeing enemy, in the close combat phase he will score one automatic hit at +1 Strength and then his opponent will flee again (if he survives). |
| 2 | Blessed Ale | 5 | Like his brother Ulric, Taal has a great appetite for the strong ales of the Northern Empire. During the summer equinox each village in Ostland opens one keg of ale (at least!) in Taal’s honour. Drinking a flask of Taal-blessed ale (the priest is assumed to carry as many flasks as are needed) may heal any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself). The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, any living enemy models (not Undead or Possessed) within 2" of the Priest will be lose 1 Attack during the next round of combat due to the potent fumes of the ale. |
| 3 | Bear’s Paw | 7 | Many an armored knight has been knocked to the ground by the surprising Strength of the followers of Taal. Although traditionally called ‘Bear’s Paw’ this spell is sometimes referred to as ‘Moose’s Breath’ by those Ostlander’s who have felt its power. The Priest invokes the blessing of Taal on himself or a single friendly model within 6". The target receives a bonus of +2 to his Strength until the Priest’s next turn.|
| 4 | Earthshudder | 9 | Taal’s domain includes both the earth and the skies and his power can reach out even into the dark streets of Mordheim. When his name is invoked three times and the blood of an eagle is poured on the ground, the Lord of the Wild will cause thunder to rumble and the earth to shake. The spell is cast on a single building within 4". Any enemy models touching the building will suffer a single S3 hit. In addition the building will collapse and any models on it will count as having fallen to the ground (for example a model falling 5" to the tabletop must pass two Initiative tests to avoid taking D3 S5 hits.) Remove the terrain feature from the board for the rest of the game. |
| 5 | Tanglefoot | 8 | It is said that when Taal walked the earth, living things would spring up behind him as he passed. A portion of his power can be summoned by his followers to help regrow forests and aid in the return of the land to its natural state. Plants, vines and even small trees burst forth from the earth, hindering all those who attempt to move through them. All models (friend as well as foe) with the exception of Ostlander Jaeger within 12" of the Priest can only move at 1/2 speed until the next shooting phase. |
| 6 | Summon Squirrels | 7 | Taal is the master of all beasts both great and small. Those who anger him may be mauled by a mountain lion or drowned in a flood caused by an angry beaver. With this spell the Priest invokes the wrath of the Lord of Beasts, summoning forth dozens upon dozens of enraged squirrels. The furious rodents assault one enemy within 12" of the Priest, crawling inside the warrior’s clothing and armor, pelting him with nuts and causing numerous tiny bites and welts. The target suffers 2D6 Strength 1 hits. No armor saves allowed. |

##### Prayers of Ulric

In a similar way to Sigmarite Sisters and Warrior-Priests and their prayers to Sigmar, Wolf Priest call upon their god for assistance in times of battle. Wolf Priest may use a wolf cloak and still chant these prayers. They are prayers, not spells, and thus any special protection against spells does not affect them. Wolf Priest use the rules for magic with the following prayers.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Snow Squall | 6 | Ulric extends his protection to the Wolf Priest in the form of a localized snow squall that engulfs the model. All enemy models in Hand-to-Hand combat with the abbess are at -1 to hit due to the swirling snow and winds. The spell lasts for the duration of the Hand-to-Hand combat. |
| 2 | Hammerschlag | 10 | The Wolf Priest calls down a hammer blow from Ulric on any model within 6". That model suffers a S4 attack from an enormous ethereal hammer, including the concussion special rule. |
| 3 | Bloodlust | 7 | The Wolf Priest is infused with a lust for battle and attacks wildly. All attacks are at S +2, and she scores a critical hit on a 5-6. The Abbess must test, by rolling the prayer's | or greater on 2d6, each turn to see if the prayer remains in effect. |
| 4 | Wolf's Hunger | 7 | One member of the warband (abbess's choice) is thrown into a Frenzy. |
| 5 | Ulric's Howl | 10 | The Wolf Priest’s prayer is answered as an ear-shattering inhuman howl roars from him throat. For the duration of the battle, all members of the priest's warband are immune to Fear, Terror or All Alone tests as they feel the presence of their god. Additionally, all Rout tests are at +1. | 
| 6 | Call of Ulric | 10| The Wolf Priest lets out a cry of agony as her body re-shapes itself into that of a huge, slavering wolf (see below). During the time that the Wolf Priest is in the form of a wolf, she may do nothing but attack as a wolf, therefore, no spell-casting or weapons use. He still hates Sigmar's minions, however. In each shooting phase, the Wolf Priest may choose to make a Ld test (using the wolf's Ld 6) to regain her human form. If she is still in wolf form at the end of the battle, she gets one last chance to return to human form. If she does not, then she remains a wolf forever! He is still a Hire Sword, and thus entitled to XP gains and attribute increases. He may only choose skills from the Speed Table, with the exception of Scale Sheer Surfaces. |

##### Funerary Rites

By Todd Estabrook (legion@ennui.net)
Priests of Morr use Funerary rites to insure that the dead remain dead, that their body is sanctified and sealed and
their soul departed to pass on to Morr. They are prayers, not spells, and thus any special protection against spells does
not affect them.
Funerary rites work like the Prayers of Sigmar although the Priest of Morr never wears armor.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Morr's Protection | 6 | The priest of Morr calls out to his god when confronted by an abomination - and asks that he be shielded from the corrupted magics of the tainted. Any Magical attacks (spells) made by a Necromancer or a Magister or Daemons, which would be considered a Direct Attack on the priest of Morr, will be negated if this rite is successful. |
| 2 | Death Holds No Fear | Auto | Priests of Morr must be steadfast in their resolution and as such must, above all else, have no fear of death. The priest of Morr is now Fearless for the remainder of the combat. |
| 3 | Sanctity of the Fallen | 7 | Those who fall shall be sanctified and their soul freed, in the name of Morr, god of death. The priest of Morr may attempt to perform the Rite of Sanctity on a model (friend or foe) who has been taken Out of Action. The priest of Morr must be within 6" of the model in question. If successful, that model may not be raised up by a Necromancer. |
| 4 | Hand of Morr | 7 | By his hand, symbolic of the hand of Morr, the unliving shall become as dust and ashes. The priest of Morr must be in base-to-base contact with an undead model. Before Hand-to-Hand combat occurs, the priest of Morr may attempt to use the Hand of Morr rite. If successful, Zombies, Dire Wolves and Vampires immediately go Out of Action. Furthermore, Ghouls and Possessed will immediately (instead of engaging in Hand-to- Hand) flee their full Move away from the priest of Morr. |
| 5 | Do you know who I am? | 7 | Gaze upon me, abomination, for I am a priest of Morr. This rite has a range of 6" and must be directed at the closest Undead model first, or if no Undead are within range, at the next closest human servant of the Undead (Dregs, Ghouls, Necromancers), or finally at any model. If successful, that model is immediately Stunned. If the model cannot be Stunned, then it is Knocked Down instead. |
| 6 | I am death! | 8 | I am a priest of Morr, god of death! It is a well known fact that the priests of Morr are not martially inclined. Their divine duties involved the dead, not the taking of life. However, there are times when a priest of Morr will be called to engage in combat and who would be more feared than a representative of the god of Death? This spell gives the priest of Morr a 6+ armor save and increases their WS by either +1 or makes it 4, whichever is greater. |

##### Prayers of Ranald

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Thief's speed | 6 | Calling upon Ranald, the priest moves with an almost supernatural speed. The priest may immediately make a 12" move to anywhere. |
| 2 | Fool's Gold | 9 | With a brief mutter, a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it. Nominate a spot within 8" of the caster. All members of the opposing warband that can see it must run towards it, unless they pass a Ld test. The enemy leader is always immune, as is anyone immune to psychology. This lasts for a turn |
| 3 | Ogre's Head | 7 | The priest's head suddenly takes the form of an ogre. The priest causes fear for a turn. |
| 4 | Sleep | 10 | The priest causes his foes to sleep while he runs away. All enemy models within 4" have to take a Ld test or they become stunned, even if they have more than one wound. Helmets won't save them. |
| 5 | Luck of Ranald | 6 | Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers and his blessings are upon the priest. The Priest may reroll any dice-roll in the next turn. |
| 6 | Shadows of Ranald | 6 | The priest moves into the shadows, obscuring him from would be chargers. The priest may not be charged. If in combat, move him 1" apart. |

##### Norse Runes

The Norse Shaman starts with two ‘Runes’ from the following chart. These are treated in the same way as Sigmarite Prayers
and can be cast whilst wearing armor. Abilities that give saves against spells, give saves against runes.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Howl of the North | 9 | Icy winds sweep before the Shaman knocking missiles from their path. The Shaman is immune to all missile fire. Roll a dice during the Shaman’s recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the winds dissipate. |
| 2 | Angvar’s Fury | 7 | The Shaman’s howls rouses the anger of the warriors around him to a fever pitch. All warriors within 8" of the Shaman gain a +1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat against the opposing warband. The spell lasts till the start of the Norse players next turn. |
| 3 | Elvek’s Cold Spear | 7 | A razor sharp icicle flies at the Shaman’s foe. The icicle has a range of 18" and causes one S4 hit. It strikes the first model in its path. Normal armor saves applies. |
| 4 | Gift of the Fates | 7 | The Shaman calls on the three Wyrd Sisters of Norse legend for a glimpse of the future. The Shaman may adjust one die roll by +/-1 between a successful casting of this rune & his next recovery phase. A to wound roll adjusted to or from 6 will not cause a critical. |
| 5 | Kiss of Frost | 6 | The Shaman covers ground of his choosing with slick ice. A single model within 12" of the Shaman must pass an Initiative test or be knocked down. |
| 6 | Bear’s Might | 9 | The Shaman calls upon the spirits of the great Ice Bears of the North to aid him. The Shaman gains +1 Attack, +2 Strength, +2 Toughness and lose -2 Initiative (to a minimum of 1). Take a Leadership test at the beginning of each turn (both your’s and your opponent’s). If the test fails, Bear’s Might drains away. Bear’s Might can only be cast successfully once per game. |

##### Shadow Warrior Magic

Shadow Weavers use a strange blend of magic that differs in many ways to the traditional High Magic of their cousins of the Tower of Hoeth.

Author’s note: Several of the following spells mention that the target must be within a certain distance of ‘a wall’. This is not literally restricted to walls, but may include any piece of terrain that could be expected to cast a man-sized shadow.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Pool of Shadow | 7 | The area immediately surrounding the mage is suddenly filled with twisting shadows that make it nearly impossible to see anything inside. This spell allows the mage and all within 6" to Hide, exactly as if there were a wall or other obstruction between them and their enemies. They may Hide even after marching. This Hiding is disrupted if any enemy enters the area of affect. In addition, all affected count as being in cover against enemy shooting. This spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s next turn. |
| 2 | The Living Shadows | 7 | Shadows around the target suddenly writhe as if alive and move to strike the victim. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 12" of him and within 2" of a wall. The target suffers a single Strength 4 hit with no armor saves. |
| 3 | Wings of Night | 6 | Wings of darkness unfurl from the Shadow Weaver’s back and engulf him. He disappears, only to reappear in nearby shadow. This spell may only be cast if the Shadow Weaver is within 2" of a wall. He is instantly moved up to 12" to a place that is also within 2" of a wall. If moved into contact with an enemy model, the Shadow Weaver counts as charging in the first round. |
| 4 | Cloak of Darkness | 7 | The Shadow Weaver appears to be swallowed by shadows that even the sharpest senses cannot pierce. The Shadow Weaver is effectively concealed from enemy sight. As long as he does not attack (cast spells, shoot, or engage in close combat) any enemy models, he may not be attacked. He may intercept as normal if the player controlling him wishes, but he does not have to do so (and if he does not, enemy warriors may charge past him of course). The spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver attacks an enemy model. Note that a model engaged in close combat with an enemy warrior may never choose to not attack. |
| 5 | Shadowbind | 9 | Tendrils of darkness rise from the shadows to engulf an enemy warrior, rendering him helpless to the whims of the Shadow Weaver. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 24" of him and 2" of a wall. The target may not move unless it first passes a Strength test on 2D6 at the start of his turn (before the Recovery Phase). This spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver suffers a Wound or attempts to cast another spell. If attacked while affected by this spell, treat the target exactly as if he were Stunned. |
| 6 | Shield of Shadow | 7 | Shadows congeal and become a solid barrier in front of the Shadow Weaver or one of his comrades, protecting the target from enemy attacks. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell on himself or a member of his warband within 12". The target receives an armor save of 5+ that is not modified by the attacker’s Strength. The spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s next turn. |

##### Fey Magic

Wood elf magic draws upon the raw forces of nature granting the mage the ability to wield some of its primordial power.

| - | Tree Singing | 5
The Spellsinger encourages the spirits of the woods to make the forest shift and begin moving.
This spell can be cast on any woodland, tree, shrub, etc within 24" of the caster, provided there are no enemy models within. The spell makes the chosen woodland move 2D3" in a direction nominated by the caster before rolling. Any friendly model within the woodland will move with the woodland. The woodland must stop 1" away from any enemy models.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Inner fear | 6 | The mage projects the image of primordial horrors in his target.
The Wood Elf Mage causes fear in her enemies for the duration of the battle. |
| 2 | The Green Eye | 9 | The wizard projects a bolt of mystic green energy 18" long and 1" wide that ignores terrain and obstructions. Any
    model who’s base is even partially under this line must roll under their Initiative or suffer d3 S4 hits. Range: 18 |
| 3 | Hunting Spear | 9 | The wizard hurls a mystical spear at any enemy model within LOS not fighting in Hand to Hand, rolling to hit using his
    BS. Any model struck by the spell suffers a single S6 hit that causes d3 Wounds. Normal Armor saves do not apply.
    Range: 24" |
| 4 | Thorn Call | 8 | Thick Vines sprout out of the ground tearing and ensnaring its victim.
This spell has a range of 12". The spell may be cast on a single enemy model entrapping the victim in constricting
    thorny vines. The target may test to see if he can get free at the start of his next turn by rolling equal or under his
    strength value if he fails he suffers a strength 4 hit as the thorns wound him as he struggles. While trapped by this spell
    a warrior may do nothing at all and may not fight if engaged in hand to hand combat if he is attacked this way then he is
    treated as been "knocked down" and if an enemy can wound him he is taken out of action. |
| 5 | Ariel’s Blessing | 7 | Tendrils and Vines burst from the Mages arm binding and embracing a fallen warrior, filling him with life and
    returning him to his feet filled with the power of the forest.
The Mage may put any model who has been taken out of action back on their feet ready for action as if they had never
    been taken out. Note if the mage himself has been taken out of action he may not bring himself back to the battle.
    Friendly models taken out of action are left on the board where they perished and the mage may only bring them back
    to life if he is base to base contact. |
| 6 | Eagle’s cry | 8 | The caster utters a melodious cry, which sounds like an great eagle. This inspires the elves so much they gain the
    legendary sight of Thuarindir.
All elves within 6” gain +1 on to hit and +1 on the critical hit table. |

##### Spells of the Djed’hi

The Mage chooses a single enemy model he can see. That model may not move as long as the Mage remains both static
and alive. The Mage and the target may cast spells normally, but fight in close combat at -2 WS (minimum of 1). |
| 4 | Fleeting Shadows | 8 | The Mage slips between worlds, shimmering in and out of existence and becoming hard to pinpoint exactly.
The first time the Mage is hit in close combat or shooting, the spell protects him and the hit is ignored. Move the Mage
2" from his current position in a random direction (but not off a cliff, etc). This is where he really was all along. The
spell remains in play until it saves the Mage from a hit, whereupon it is dispelled. It may not be cast again whilst it is in
play. |
| 5 | Hunter’s Fury | 9 | The Mage gestures at the target, and glowing arrows shoot from his fingertips to fly at the foe.
The spell summons D3+1 arrows which the Mage can use to shoot against one enemy model following the rules for
normal shooting. The arrows have a range of 36". Use the Mage’s own Ballistic Skill to determine whether he hits or
not, but ignore movement, range and cover penalties. Each arrow causes one S3 hit. |
| 6 | Silent Guardian | 9 | Glowing swords appear by the Mage, leaping to his defence if he is attacked in close combat.
This spell acts as an invisible guardian that will defend the Mage. If the Mage is attacked in close combat then the
guardian will fight first with WS5, S3. The guardian will make 1 attack per turn against each enemy that attacks the
Mage. The guardian will not leave the Mage’s side, and will only fight if the Mage himself is being attacked. The
Guardian cannot be attacked in return and will only be dispelled if the Mage casts another spell or dies. |

##### Lesser magic

Those who have not been schooled in the ways of magic can cast only relatively simple spells. Many human wizards,
lacking the tradition of sorcery and the grimoires of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, have to rely on their own natural
aptitude and experimentation.
Lesser Magic (or hedge magic) is used by human warlocks. It may not be as awesome as the mighty spells of Necromancers
and Chaos Mages, but it is still dangerous.

###### D6 Result

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Fires of U’Zhul | 7 | The wizard summons a fiery ball of flames and hurls it upon his enemies.

taken as normal (i.e., with -1 modifier). |
| 2 | Flight of Zimmeran | 7 | Calling upon the power of the winds of magic, the wizard walks on air.
The wizard may immediately move anywhere within 12", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case he
counts as charging. If he engages a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase he will score 1 automatic hit and then his
opponent will flee again (if he survives). |
| 3 | Dread of Aramar | 7 | The wizard places a sense of mind-numbing fear into the minds of his opponents.
A single model within 12" of the wizard must pass a Leadership test or flee 2D6" directly away from him. If he flees, he
must test at the start of each of his own movement phases and will continue to flee until he passes a test. Note that this
spell does not affect Undead or any model immune to fear. |
| 4 | Silver Arrows of Arha | 7 | Silvery arrows appear from thin air and circle around the wizard, shooting out to strike his foes.
Unlike other spells, this cannot be cast whilst in hand-to-hand combat. The spell summons D6+2 arrows which the
wizard can use to shoot against one enemy model. The arrows have a range of 24". Use the wizard’s own Ballistic Skill
to determine whether he hits or not, but ignore movement, range and cover penalties. The arrows cause one S3 hit each. |
| 5 | Luck of Shemtek | 6 | The wizard summons the fickle power of magic to manipulate chance.
The wizard may re-roll all his failed dice rolls, though the second results stand. The effect lasts until the beginning of
his own next turn. |
| 6 | Sword of Rezhebel | 8 | A flaming sword appears in the hand of the wizard, promising red ruin to all who stand in his way.
The sword gives the wizard +1 Attack, +2 Strength and +2 Weapon Skill. Take a Leadership test at the beginning of
each of the wizard’s own turns. If the test fails, the sword disappears. |

veins.

##### Dark Elf Magic

The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High

strength and vigour.
Once successfully cast, the Sorceress has to make a to hit roll against a model in base contact. If the attack is successful

and the extra wound is lost at the end of the battle. |

##### Necromancy

Necromancy is the magic of the dead. It grants Necromancers the power to raise the dead and command spirits, but also to
destroy the vitality of the living.

###### D6 Result

You may choose a single model within 6". The target suffers a wound (no save allowed) and the Necromancer gains an
extra wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the Necromancer’s Wounds above his original maximum
value. This spell will not affect the Possessed or any Undead models. |
| 2 | Re-Animation | 5 | At the spoken command of the Necromancer, the dead rise to fight again. | One Zombie that went out of action during the last hand-to-hand combat or Shooting phase immediately returns to the

with an enemy model. |

what happens to the unfortunate warrior. |
| 5 | Call of Vanhel | 6 | The Necromancer summons the world of the dead to invigorate his Undead servants.
A single Zombie or Dire Wolf within 6" of the Necromancer may immediately move again up to its maximum
Movement distance (i.e., 9" in the case of Dire Wolves). If this moves them into base contact with an enemy model,
they count as charging.
6 Spell of Awakening | Auto |
The Necromancer calls the soul of a slain Hero back to his body and enslaves him with corrupt magic.
If an enemy Hero is killed (i.e., your opponent rolls 11-16 on the Serious Injury chart after the battle) then the
Necromancer may raise him to fight as a Zombie in his servitude.
The dead Hero retains his characteristics and all his weapons and armor but may not use any other equipment or skills.
He may no longer run, counts as a Henchman group on his own, and may not gain additional experience. This spell
always succeeds (rules for Henchmen and experience are described later). The new Zombie follows all the normal
Zombie rules (immune to poison, causes fear) except for retaining his profile, weapons and armor. |
