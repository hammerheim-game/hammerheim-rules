<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->


There have always been those who have used magic: witches
and wizards, wise women and warlocks. But as all scholars
know, all magic is dangerous, for it originates from Chaos,
the source of corruption and change. Indeed, during these
times, sorcery is illegal and punishable by death.
Wizards have little say in whether the world of magic touches
them or not. They are born with second sight and to them the
world of magical energies and spells is much more real than
the mundane world of normal mortals. With all the
persecution, fear and hatred it is little wonder that wizards
become reclusive and suspicious, and many are downright
insane. Some even turn to the worship of the dark gods, and
others follow the forbidden path of necromancy.
Mordheim has become home to many magic users and they
roam the ruins hiding from Witch Hunters. But there are
other ways of gaining power over and above that of a normal
mortal man. The gods watch over their subjects and a priest
of strong faith can call upon them to assist him in battle. Of
these, the Priests of Sigmar are the most common, for Sigmar
is the patron god of the Empire, and his following is strong
during these times of strife.

Most wizards start with one randomly determined spell, but may gain more. Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart. If you get the same spell twice, roll again or lower the spell’s difficulty by 1. 

#### Casting spells

In order to cast a spell, the caster must roll 2D6. If they equal or exceed the casting value of the spell then the spell has succeeded! If their roll includes 2 or more 6's then the caster has casted with Irresistable force. Their spell may not be dispelled and after resolving it they must roll on the Miscast table in the Warhammer rulebook. Note that Prayers behave exactly like spells, except they do not miscast and may be used even when wearing armour.

There are several different types of spell, each behaving differently:

Hex: Hex spells are malific enchantments that inflict some sort of negative status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any foe to be the target of a Hex as long as they are in line of sight.

Augment: Augment spells are powerful enhancements that bestow some sort of positive status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any ally to be the target of an Augment as long as they are in line of sight. Note that many Augment spells only effect the caster.

Direct Damage: Direct Damage spells are the term used for any magic that inflicts damage but is not necessarily a projectile. This might be a snap of the fingers causing an enemy to burst into flames for instance. Direct Damage spells may freely be targeted on any enemy as long as they are within line of sight.

Magic Missile: Magic Missile spells tend to be more powerful than Direct Damage spells, or easier to cast. They represent streaming bolts of fire, or lightning lances that have to trace towards their target. Magic Missiles behave in the same way as Shooting attacks in every way, so may not be used against targets in combat or if the wizard themself is in combat.

#### Damage

Some spells cause direct damage, and are resolved the same way as damage from shooting or blows in hand-to-hand combat. Models always receive armor saves against wounds caused by spells unless noted otherwise. 

#### Spell Lists

<div class='wide'>
##### Prayers of Sigmar

Those with great faith in the gods can call upon their divine power. The priests of Sigmar can pray for many miracles:
healing of wounds, strengthening the resolve of their comrades or the banishment of Daemonic creatures and the Undead.
The Prayers of Sigmar can be used by Witch Hunter Warrior Priests and Sigmarite Matriarchs. A warrior may use the divine
power of Sigmar while wearing armor. Prayers of Sigmar are not regarded as spells, so any special protection against spells
does not affect them.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | The Hammer of Sigmar | 7 | This weapon of the faithful glows with a golden light, imbued as it is with the righteous power of Sigmar. Augment spell.The wielder gains +2 Strength in hand-to-hand combat and all hits he inflicts cause double damage (e.g., 2 wounds instead of 1). The Priest must test each shooting phase he wants to use the Hammer. |
| 2 | Hearts of Steel | 8 | Asaves of glory surround the servant of Sigmar, the faithful are heartened by the warrior god’s presence. Augment spell. Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear and All Alone tests. In addition, the whole warband gains +1 to any Rout tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, i.e., the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +1. |
| 3 | Soulfire | 9 | Purifying flames surround the Priest and wipe out those who resist the righteous fury of the God-Emperor! Direct Damage spell.All enemy models within 4" of the servant of Sigmar suffer a Strength 3 hit. No armor saves are allowed. The servants of darkness and Chaos are especially susceptible to Sigmar’s holy power. Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead. |
| 4 | Shield of Faith | 6 | A shield of pure white light appears in front of the Priest. As long as his faith remains strong the shield will protect him. Augment spell. The Priest is immune to all spells. Roll at the beginning of each turn in the recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the shield disappears. |
| 5 | Healing Hand | 5  | Laying hands upon a wounded comrade, the servant of Sigmar calls upon his Lord to heal the warrior’s wounds. Augment spell.Any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2" are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal. |
| 6 | Armor of Righteousness | 9 | Impenetrable armor covers the Priest and the fiery image of a twin-tailed comet burns above his head. Augment spell. The Priest has an armor save of 2+ which replaces his normal armor save. In addition, he causes fear in his enemies
and is therefore immune to fear himself. The power of the Armor of Righteousness lasts until the beginning of the Priest’s next Shooting phase. |

##### Prayers of Shallaya

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Regeneration | Auto | After the game the Priestess may Heal 1 serious Injury of any 1 Hero. Optionally, 1 Hero may reroll a 'Dead' result,  ignoring Robbed, Captured, Horrible Scars, and Sold to the Pits; |
| 2 | Heal |  5 | Augment spell. Restores a single unit (including self) to full wounds, Stunned models become knocked down, Knocked Down stand up: Range: 2". Note: If the priestess deliberately Heals an opponent, she gains an additional experience point. |

</div>

<div class='wide'>
##### Prayers of Taal

Taal is the God of Nature and demands the respect of all those who enter the wild regions of the Empire. He is
portrayed as a tall, broad-shouldered man with long wild hair and a thick beard. He wears a stag skull as a helm and is
clothed in bison and bear skins. He is often called the Lord of Beasts. His followers include rangers, trappers and those
who live in the wilds of the Empire.
Prayers of Taal work like the Prayers of Sigmar although the Taal Priest never wears armor.
D6 Result
| 1 | Stag’s Leap | 7
Many of Taal’s priests wear a stag skull as a symbol of their devotion and the Forest Lord’s power can be used to
emulate the speed and beauty of this magnificent beast.
Augment spell. The Priest of Taal may immediately move anywhere within 9", including into base-contact with the enemy, in which
case they count as charging and gain a +1 Strength to their first round of attacks. If they engage a fleeing enemy, in the
close combat phase they will score one automatic hit at +1 Strength and then his opponent will flee again (if they survive).
| 2 | Blessed Ale | 5
Like his brother Ulric, Taal has a great appetite for the strong ales of the Northern Empire. During the summer equinox
each village in Ostland opens one keg of ale (at least!) in Taal’s honour.
Augment spell. Drinking a flask of Taal-blessed ale (the priest is assumed to carry as many flasks as are needed) may heal any one
model within 2" of the Priest (including themself). The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, any
living enemy models (not Undead or Possessed) within 2" of the Priest will be lose 1 Attack during the next round of
combat due to the potent fumes of the ale, down to a minimum of 1.
| 3 | Bear’s Paw | 7
Many an armored knight has been knocked to the ground by the surprising Strength of the followers of Taal. Although
traditionally called ‘Bear’s Paw’ this spell is sometimes referred to as ‘Moose’s Breath’ by those Ostlander’s who have
felt its power.
Augment spell. The Priest invokes the blessing of Taal on himself or a single friendly model within 6". The target receives a bonus of
+2 to his Strength until the Priest’s next turn.
| 4 | Earthshudder | 9
Taal’s domain includes both the earth and the skies and his power can reach out even into the dark streets of
Mordheim. When his name is invoked three times and the blood of an eagle is poured on the ground, the Lord of the
Wild will cause thunder to rumble and the earth to shake.
Direct Damage spell. The spell is cast on a single building within 4". The building immediately collapses as if it was the target
of the Collapsing Building random happening. Has no effect on objective buildings.
| 5 | Tanglefoot | 8
It is said that when Taal walked the earth, living things would spring up behind him as he passed. A portion of his
power can be summoned by his followers to help regrow forests and aid in the return of the land to its natural state.
Plants, vines and even small trees burst forth from the earth, hindering all those who attempt to move through them. Hex spell. All
models (friend as well as foe) with the exception of the Priest can only move at 1/2 speed until the next shooting phase.
| 6 | Summon Squirrels | 7
Taal is the master of all beasts both great and small. Those who anger him may be mauled by a mountain lion or
drowned in a flood caused by an angry beaver.
With this spell the Priest invokes the wrath of the Lord of Beasts, summoning forth dozens upon dozens of enraged
squirrels. Magic Missile. The furious rodents assault one enemy within 12" of the Priest, crawling inside the warrior’s clothing and
armor, pelting him with nuts and causing numerous tiny bites and welts. The target suffers 2D6 Strength 1 hits. No
armor saves allowed.

<div class='wide'>
##### Prayers of Ulric

In a similar way to Sigmarite Sisters and Warrior-Priests and their prayers to Sigmar, Wolf Priest call upon their god
for assistance in times of battle. Wolf Priest may use a wolf cloak and still chant these prayers. They are prayers, not
spells, and thus any special protection against spells does not affect them. Wolf Priest use the rules for magic with the
following prayers.
D6 Result
| 1 | Snow Squall | 6
Ulric extends his protection to the Wolf Priest in the form of a localized snow squall that engulfs the model. Augment spell. All enemy
models in Hand-to-Hand combat with the caster are at -1 to hit due to the swirling snow and winds. The spell lasts until the
start of the caster's next magic phase.
| 2 | Hammerschlag | 10
The Wolf Priest calls down a hammer blow from Ulric on any model within 6". Direct damage spell. That model suffers a single S5 hit from the
enormous ethereal hammer, including the concussion special rule as it is a club.
| 3 | Bloodlust | 8
The Wolf Priest is infused with a lust for battle and attacks wildly. Augment spell. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase they
gain the Frenzy special rule and +1 Strength.
| 4 | Run With The Pack | 7
Augment spell. The caster and any ally within 4" may immediately make an additional move as normal - this may be a charge.
| 5 | Ulric's Howl | 10
The Wolf Priest’s prayer is answered as an ear-shattering inhuman howl roars from their throat. Augment spell. For the duration of the
battle, all members of the priest's warband are immune to Fear, Terror or All Alone tests as they feel the presence of
their god. Additionally, all Rout tests are at +1.
| 6 | Call of Ulric | 11
The Wolf Priest lets out a cry of agony as their body re-shapes itself into that of a huge, slavering wolfkin creature. Augment spell. The
caster loses 1 WS but gains Fear, +1 Strength, +1 Toughness, +1 Attack, and +1 Wound and is considered Monstrous Infantry. They lose
 the benefits of all equipment they were using, and will gain no experience in this form as they are overwhelmed by Ulric's 
primal compulsions. At the start of each of the caster's recovery phases they may attempt to revert to their human form
 by taking a Leadership test at their own leadership. If they are still in their Wolfkin form at the end of the battle they
 make make one final attempt to revert their condition. If failed their stat changes become permanent and they become a 
Henchman in your warband. They lose all skills and experience they once had, may never gain experience, and any
equipment they may have once had is lost.



</div>

<div class='wide'>
##### Funerary Rites

Priests of Morr use Funerary rites to ensure that the dead remain dead, that their body is sanctified and sealed and
their soul departed to pass on to Morr. They are prayers, not spells, and thus any special protection against spells does
not affect them.

D6 Result
| 1 | Morr's Protection | 6
Morr will not protect the body, but will protect the soul. With a quickly worded plea the Priest may draw
about a deathly veil that protects the target from corruptive magicks.
Morr's Protection is an Augment prayer with a range of 12". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase 
the target may not be the target of spells cast by an Undead, Daemon, or follower of Chaos. Spells that 
Target all models in an area will not effect the augmented target.
| 2 | Death Holds No Fear | Auto
Priests of Morr must be steadfast in their resolution and as such must, above all else, have no fear of death.
Warbands that recruit them find this attitude rubbing off on them, and with time the chill grasp of death begins
to feel more like a reassuring hearth welcoming them for whenever their time comes. So long as the Priest knows
this spell and remains in the warband, the entire warband is Unbreakable.
| 3 | Mortality | 7
The majority of history of the Old World is one of mortals terrified of death, seeking to continue their lives through
legacy or reanimation. It is a universal fear, and with a prayer the Priest may envelop themselves in a chilling
shroud that draws up over their head like a hood. To peer under it is to percieve an unknowable truth of an abyssal
nothingness of an afterlife. Mortality is an Augment prayer that may only be cast on the Priest and grants them the Terror special
rule. Lasts until the Priest takes a wound.
| 4 | Reclamation | 7
It is well known that Priests of Morr are an anathema to the Undead, the souls bound through necromancy to decaying
corpses able to be freed through the touch of a Priest of Morr. Reclamation is a Direct Damage spell that targets one foe
in base contact with the caster. Undead targets must take an immediate Leadership test - if passed all is well. If failed
for every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. Non-Undead targets are mildly confused about
what this gaunt stranger is doing but suffer no other effects. If no undead warbands are present in the campaign this spell
may be re-rolled.
| 5 | Services Unto Morr | Auto
No corpse is safe in Mordheim, even the burnt or buried. A Priest of Morr will safeguard the souls of the departed to ensure
they are not abused by foul sorcery, and such dilligent work in service of their god doubtless earns them favour. The Priest
gains +1 experience whenever an ally is permanently killed (excluding mounts).
| 6 | Slip Away | 8
Priests of Morr are in the business of preserving the sanctity of death rather than the taking of life, and yet many Warriors
dying agonizing deaths have been allowed mercy at the hands of a Priest of Morr who expediates the process. This magic
does however have several other.. Practical uses. Slip Away is a Direct Damage spell with a range of 12". For every wound
the target is missing they take an additional wound with no armour saves allowed.


</div>

<div class='wide'>
##### Prayers of Ranald

D6 Result
| 1 | Thief's speed | 7
Calling upon Ranald, the priest moves with an almost supernatural speed. Augment spell. Until
the start of the caster's next magic phase their Movement value is increased by 3.
| 2 | Fool's Gold | 7
With a brief mutter, a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it.
Nominate a spot within 12" of the caster. Hex spell. All unengaged enemy warband members within 6" of
the target area must take a Leadership test. If failed then in their movement phase they 
will walk D6"  towards the target, ending their movement (though they may still shoot as normal).
This has no effect on Warriors who are Immune to Psychology, or on animals.
| 3 | Lucky Guess | 7
Hex spell. The Priest calls out a scathing made-up insult at any enemy on the board. If the enemy is within their
detection range of the Priest (double their initiative value in inches usually), they will gain 
the Frenzy special rule and Hates the Priest until the end of the battle. 
| 4 | Whoops! | 5
What horrible luck that they should happen to step on that one loose ladder rung, put their foot
through that one rotted plank, or that a falling roofslate would happen to land exactly on
their head? Whoops is a Hex spell with a range of 24". Until the start of the caster's next
magic phase the target treats all terrain as Dangerous Terrain.
| 5 | What Fortune! | 11	
Augment spell. Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers, Priests that ask for direct wealth rarely meet with fortune.
Or perhaps knowing that makes this all the riskier? If successfully cast the Priest immediately
comes into posession of a Wyrdstone Shard.
| 6 | Black Cat | 6
As if from nowhere a small feral cat the caster just happened to have befriended earlier leaps from 
behind the Priest and directly onto the face of their assailant in a flurry of angry claws and fur.
Black Cat is a direct damage spell that may be cast on an enemy in base contact with the caster, inflicting
D6 S3 automatic hits. If the spell fails to cast the cat does still appear, but simply watches in disinterest.

</div>

<div class='wide'>
##### Norse Runes

The Norse Shaman starts with two ‘Runes’ from the following chart. These are treated in the same way as Sigmarite Prayers
and can be cast whilst wearing armor. Abilities that give saves against spells, give saves against runes.
D6 Result
| 1 | Howl of the North | 9
Icy winds sweep before the Shaman knocking missiles from their path.
Augment spell. The Shaman is immune to all missile fire. Roll a dice during the Shaman’s recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the winds
dissipate.
| 2 | Angvar’s Fury | 7
The Shaman’s howls rouses the anger of the warriors around him to a fever pitch.
Augment spell. All warriors within 8" of the Shaman gain a +1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat. The spell
lasts till the start of the Norse players next turn.
| 3 | Elvek’s Cold Spear | 6
A razor sharp icicle flies at the Shaman’s foe.
The icicle is a Magic Missile and has a range of 18" and causes one S4 hit. Models wounded by the icicle are at 1 Initiative until the start of the caster's next magic phase.
| 4 | Gift of the Fates | 7
The Shaman calls on the three Wyrd Sisters of Norse legend for a glimpse of the future.
Augment Spell. The Shaman may adjust any one die roll of any player by +/-1 between a successful casting of this rune & his next recovery phase. A to
wound roll adjusted to or from 6 will not cause a critical.
| 5 | Kiss of Frost | 6
The Shaman covers ground of his choosing with slick ice.
Direct Damage spell. A single model within 12" of the Shaman must pass an Initiative test or be knocked down.
| 6 | Bear’s Might | 9
The Shaman calls upon the spirits of the great Ice Bears of the North to aid him.
Augment Spell. The Shaman gains +1 Attack, +2 Strength, +2 Toughness and loses -2 Initiative (to a minimum of 1). Take a Leadership
test at the beginning of each turn (both your’s and your opponent’s). If the test fails, Bear’s Might drains away.

<div class='wide'>
##### Shadow Warrior Magic

Shadow Weavers use a strange blend of magic that differs in many ways to the traditional High Magic of their cousins
of the Tower of Hoeth.
Author’s note: Several of the following spells mention that the target must be within a certain distance of ‘a wall’. This is not
literally restricted to walls, but may include any piece of terrain that could be expected to cast a man-sized shadow.

D6 Result
| 1 | Pool of Shadow | 7
The area immediately surrounding the mage is suddenly filled with twisting shadows that make it nearly impossible to
see anything inside.
Augment Spell.This spell allows the mage and all within 6" to Hide, exactly as if there were a wall or other obstruction between them
and their enemies. They may Hide even after marching. This Hiding is disrupted if any enemy enters the area of affect.
In addition, all affected count as being in cover against enemy shooting. This spell lasts until the start of the Shadow
Weaver’s next turn.
| 2 | The Living Shadows | 7
Shadows around the target suddenly writhe as if alive and move to strike the victim.
Direct Damage spell. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 12" of him and within 2" of a wall. The target
suffers a single Strength 4 hit with no armor saves.
| 3 | Wings of Night | 6
Wings of darkness unfurl from the Shadow Weaver’s back and engulf him. He disappears, only to reappear in nearby
shadow.
Augment Spell. This spell may only be cast if the Shadow Weaver is within 2" of a wall. He is instantly moved up to 12" to a place that
is also within 2" of a wall. If moved into contact with an enemy model, the Shadow Weaver counts as charging in the
first round.
| 4 | Cloak of Darkness | 7
The Shadow Weaver appears to be swallowed by shadows that even the sharpest senses cannot pierce.
Augment Spell. The Shadow Weaver is effectively concealed from enemy sight. As long as he does not attack (cast spells, shoot, or
engage in close combat) any enemy models, he may not be attacked. He may intercept as normal if the player
controlling him wishes, but he does not have to do so (and if he does not, enemy warriors may charge past him of
course). The spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver attacks an enemy model. Note that a model engaged in close combat
with an enemy warrior may never choose to not attack.
| 5 | Shadowbind | 9
Tendrils of darkness rise from the shadows to engulf an enemy warrior, rendering him helpless to the whims of the
Shadow Weaver.
Hex spell. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 24" of him and 2" of a wall. The target may not
move unless it first passes a Strength test on 2D6 at the start of his turn (before the Recovery Phase). This spell lasts
until the Shadow Weaver suffers a Wound or attempts to cast another spell. If attacked while affected by this spell, treat
the target exactly as if he were Stunned.
| 6 | Shield of Shadow | 7
Shadows congeal and become a solid barrier in front of the Shadow Weaver or one of his comrades, protecting the
target from enemy attacks.
Augment Spell. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell on himself or a member of his warband within 12". The target receives a 5+ Ward save.
The spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s next turn.

<div class='wide'>
##### Fey Magic

Wood elf magic draws upon the raw forces of nature granting the mage the ability to wield some of its primordial power.

| - | Tree Singing | 5
The Spellsinger encourages the spirits of the woods to make the forest shift and begin moving.
This spell can be cast on any woodland, tree, shrub, etc within 24" of the caster, provided there are no enemy models
    within. The spell makes the chosen woodland move 2D3" in a direction nominated by the caster before rolling. Any
    friendly model within the woodland will move with the woodland. The woodland must stop 1" away from any enemy
    models.

    strength value if he fails he suffers a strength 4 hit as the thorns wound him as he struggles.
| 5 | Ariel’s Blessing | 9
Augment spell: Tendrils and Vines burst from the Mages arm binding and embracing a fallen warrior, filling him with life and
    returning him to his feet filled with the power of the forest.
The Mage may put any model who has been taken out of action back on their feet ready for action as if they had never
    been taken out. Note if the mage himself has been taken out of action he may not bring himself back to the battle.
    Friendly models taken out of action are left on the board where they perished and the mage may only bring them back
    to life if he is base to base contact.
| 6 | Eagle’s cry | 8
Augment Spell. The caster utters a melodious cry, which sounds like an great eagle. This inspires the elves so much they gain the
    legendary sight of Thuarindir.
All elves within 6” gain +1 on to hit and +1 on the critical hit table.

##### Lesser magic

Those who have not been schooled in the ways of magic can cast only relatively simple spells. Many human wizards,
lacking the tradition of sorcery and the grimoires of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, have to rely on their own natural
aptitude and experimentation.
Lesser Magic (or hedge magic) is used by human warlocks. It may not be as awesome as the mighty spells of Necromancers
and Chaos Mages, but it is still dangerous.
D6 Result
| 1 | Fires of U’Zhul | 7
The wizard summons a fiery ball of flames and hurls it upon his enemies.
Magic Missile The fireball has a range of 18" and causes one Strength 4 hit.
| 2 | Flight of Zimmeran | 7
Calling upon the power of the winds of magic, the wizard walks on air.
Augment Spell. The wizard may immediately move anywhere within 12", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case he
counts as charging. If he engages a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase he will score 1 automatic hit and then his
opponent will flee again (if he survives).
| 3 | Dread of Aramar | 7
The wizard places a sense of mind-numbing fear into the minds of his opponents.
Hex spell. A single model within 12" of the wizard must pass a Leadership test or flee 2D6" directly away from him. If he flees, he
must test at the start of each of his own movement phases and will continue to flee until he passes a test. Note that this
spell does not affect Undead or any model immune to fear.
| 4 | Silver Arrows of Arha | 7
Silvery arrows appear from thin air and circle around the wizard, shooting out to strike his foes.
Magic Missile. The spell summons D6 arrows with a range of 24". The arrows cause one S3 hit each. The caster may still fire their ranged weapon after casting.
| 5 | Luck of Shemtek | 9
The wizard summons the fickle power of magic to manipulate chance.
Augment Spell. The wizard may re-roll all their failed dice rolls, though the second results stand. The effect lasts until the beginning of
their own next turn.
