<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->


There have always been those who have used magic: witches and wizards, wise women and warlocks. But as all scholars know that all magic is dangerous, for it originates from Chaos, the source of corruption and change. Indeed, during these times, sorcery is illegal and punishable by death. Wizards have little say in whether the world of magic touches them or not. They are born with second sight and to them the world of magical energies and spells is much more real than the mundane world of normal mortals. With all the persecution, fear and hatred it is little wonder that wizards become reclusive and suspicious, and many are downright insane. Some even turn to the worship of the dark gods, and others follow the forbidden path of necromancy. Mordheim has become home to many magic users and they roam the ruins hiding from Witch Hunters. But there are other ways of gaining power over and above that of a normal mortal man. The gods watch over their subjects and a priest of strong faith can call upon them to assist them in battle. Of these the Priests of Sigmar are the most common, for Sigmar is the patron god of the Empire and his following is strong during these times of strife.

#### Allocating spells



Most wizards start with one randomly determined spell, but may gain more. Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart. If you get the same spell twice, roll again or lower the spell’s difficulty by 1. 

#### Casting spells

In order to cast a spell, the caster must roll 2D6. If they equal or exceed the casting value of the spell then the spell has succeeded! If their roll includes 2 or more 6's then the caster has casted with Irresistable force. Their spell may not be dispelled and after resolving it they must roll on the Miscast table in the Warhammer rulebook. Note that Prayers behave exactly like spells, except they do not miscast and may be used even when wearing armour.

There are several different types of spell, each behaving differently: 
 
Hex: Hex spells are malific enchantments that inflict some sort of negative status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any foe to be the target of a Hex as long as they are in line of sight.

Augment: Augment spells are powerful enhancements that bestow some sort of positive status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any ally to be the target of an Augment as long as they are in line of sight. Note that many Augment spells only effect the caster.

Direct Damage: Direct Damage spells are the term used for any magic that inflicts damage but is not necessarily a projectile. This might be a snap of the fingers causing an enemy to burst into flames for instance. Direct Damage spells may freely be targeted on any enemy as long as they are within line of sight.   

Magic Missile: Magic Missile spells tend to be more powerful than Direct Damage spells, or easier to cast. They represent streaming bolts of fire, or lightning lances that have to trace towards their target. Magic Missiles behave in the same way as Shooting attacks in every way except that they do not need to roll to hit - they always hit automatically. As they are shooting attacks they may not be used against targets in combat or if the wizard themself is in combat.

##### Prayers of Sigmar

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

| 6 | Armor of Righteousness | 9 | Augment. Sigmar's blessings strengthen in direct proportion to one's willpower and belief, a Priest who wholly believes that they will come to no harm will not. The caster gains a 4+ Ward Save that lasts until they take a wound. |

##### Prayers of Shallya

Shallya is the Goddess best known for being unrelentingly merciful and sympathetic. Priests of Shallya are beloved by all in the Empire, for their duties range from the mending of wounds to the soothing of broken hearts. She is often symbolised by a white dove, and many see the relative popularity of worship of Sigmar over Shallya as being endemic of the bloodthirsty and violent state of the world.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Regeneration | Auto | After the game the Priest may Heal a single permanent injury from any warband member. Alternatively this spell may be used in the same way as Medical Knowledge. |
| 2 | Heal | 5 | Augment. The caster may restore all lost wounds to a single ally within 12". Warriors that are _incapacitated_ immediately recover at no penalty. |
| 3 | Mass Heal | 8 | Augment. The caster may restore a single lost wound to every ally within 4". Warriors that are _incapacitated_ immediately recover at no penalty. |
| 4 | Cleanse | 6 | Augment. The caster may remove a Hex effect from an ally within 18". This will also extinguish any burning effects such as from fire arrows, or negative effects or addictions from drugs like Crimson Shade. |
| 5 | Ward Against Pain | 6 | Augment. All allies within 6" of the caster, including the caster themself, may not be stunned. Stunned models are _Knocked Down_ instead. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

##### Prayers of Taal

Taal is the God of Nature and demands the respect of all those who enter the wild regions of the Empire. He is portrayed as a tall, broad-shouldered man with long wild hair and a thick beard. He wears a stag skull as a helm and is clothed in bison and bear skins. He is often called the Lord of Beasts. His followers include rangers, trappers and those who live in the wilds of the Empire.

Unlike most schools of prayer Taal Priests may never wears armor.



| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Stag’s Leap | 6 | Augment. The Caster may immediately move anywhere within 9", including into base-contact with the enemy, in which case he counts as charging and gains a +1 Strength to his first round of attacks. If he engages a fleeing enemy, in the close combat phase he will score one automatic hit at +1 Strength and then his opponent will flee again (if he survives). |
| 2 | Blessed Ale | 5 | Augment. Drinking a flask of Taal-blessed ale (the priest is assumed to carry as many flasks as are needed) may heal any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself). The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, any living enemy models (not Undead or Possessed) within 4" of the Priest will be at -1 to hit during the next round of combat due to the potent fumes of the ale. |
| 3 | Bear’s Paw | 7 | Augment. A single ally within 12" of the caster, or the caster themself, gains +2 Strength until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 4 | Mated Pair | 9 | Augment. The caster gains two of any Attack Animal of their choice from the "Birds of Prey" section. At the start of each of the caster's recovery phases they must take a Leadership test. If failed, the birds disappears. Only one pair may be active at any one time. |
| 5 | Ensnarement | 8 | Hex. The caster may nominate a single enemy on ground level that they can see. A writhing mass of barbed vines and roots burst from the earth to ensnare them. In each of the target's Recovery phases they take a S4 hit and must take a Strength test. If passed they are freed and may behave as normal. If failed the Hex remains in place. |
| 6 | Summon Squirrels | 7 | Magic Missile. Taal is the master of all beasts both great and small. Those who anger him may be mauled by a mountain lion or drowned in a flood caused by an angry beaver. With this spell the Priest invokes the wrath of the Lord of Beasts, summoning forth dozens upon dozens of enraged squirrels. The furious rodents assault one enemy within 12" of the caster, crawling inside the warrior’s clothing and armor, pelting him with nuts and causing numerous tiny bites and welts. The target suffers 2D6 Strength 1 hits. No armor saves allowed. |

##### Prayers of Ulric

Ulric is the patron god of Middenland, but his influence as the Great Wolf extends across the Empire. Before the rise of the Cult of Sigmar it was the worship of Ulric that was most dominant, and while the two cults would eventually reconcile with the rise of Magnus the Pious (the man who would go on to raze Mordheim to the ground) in this time period the two are fierce rivals. Priests of Ulric are typically enormously strong in stature, and are often seen wearing the pelts of great Dire Wolves that they have triumphed over as a rite of passage.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Snow Squall | 6 | Augment. Ulric extends his protection to the Wolf Priest in the form of a localized snow squall that engulfs the model. All enemy models in Hand-to-Hand combat with the caster are at -1 to hit due to the swirling snow and winds. The spell lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 2 | Hammerschlag | 10 | Direct Damage. The Wolf Priest calls down a hammer blow from Ulric on any enemy within 6". That model suffers a S6 attack from an enormous ethereal hammer, including the concussion special rule. |
| 3 | Bloodlust | 7 | Augment. The caster infuses themselves with a predatory rage, attacking with a fury that puts a Norscan to shame. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase they gain +1 Strength and will critical hit on a To Wound roll of a 5-6. |
| 4 | Run With The Pack | 8 | Augment. All Allies within 4" of the caster, including the caster themself, may make an additional free move - including a charge if they wish. |
| 5 | Ulric's Howl | 10 | Augment. The Wolf Priest’s prayer is answered as an ear-shattering inhuman howl roars from their throat. For the duration of the battle, all members of the priest's warband become Immune to Psychology. | 
| 6 | Call of Ulric | 10 | Augment. The Wolf Priest lets out a cry of agony as their body re-shapes itself into that of a huge, slavering wolfkin creature. The caster gains +2 Movement, +1 Strength, and +2 Attacks but loses the effects of any equipment they were carrying. At the start of each of the caster's recovery phases they may choose to attempt to revert to their human form by taking a Leadership test at their own leadership. If they are still in their Wolfkin form at the end of the battle they make make one final attempt to revert their condition. If failed their stat changes become permanent and they become a Henchman in your warband. They lose all skills and experience they once had, may never gain experience, and any equipment they may have once had is lost.

##### Funerary Rites

Morr is the god of death among humans, though rather than be the antithesis of life Morr serves as a guardian of the dead. Prayers to Morr are typically made to ensure safe passage to the soul of a lost loved one, and to preserve them lest they be arisen as an Undead later on. As such Morr is best known for its opposition of all things necromantic, and while Priests of Morr are typically sullen, quiet, and dreamful people they are known too for their unrivalled ability to reclaim trapped souls from undead bondage.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Morr's Protection | 6 | Augment. Morr will not protect the body, but will protect the soul. With a quickly worded plea the Priest may drawabout a deathly veil that protects the target from corruptive magicks. A single ally within 12", or the caster themself, may be the target of Morr's Protection. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target may not be the target of spells cast by an Undead, Daemon, or follower of Chaos. Spells from these casters that target all models in an area will not effect the augmented target. |
| 2 | Death Holds No Fear | Auto | Priests of Morr must be steadfast in their resolution and as such must, above all else, have no fear of death. Warbands that recruit them find this attitude rubbing off on them, and with time the chill grasp of death begins to feel more like a reassuring hearth welcoming them for whenever their time comes. So long as the Priest knows this spell and remains in the warband, the entire warband is Unbreakable. |
| 3 | Mortality | 7 | Augment. The majority of history of the Old World is one of mortals terrified of death, seeking to continue their lives through legacy or reanimation. It is a universal fear, and with a prayer the Priest may envelop themselves in a chilling shroud that draws up over their head like a hood. To peer under it is to percieve an unknowable truth of an abyssal nothingness of an afterlife. Mortality may only be cast on the Priest and grants them the Terror special rule. Lasts until the Priest takes a wound.|
| 4 | Reclamation | 7 | Direct Damage. Reclamation targets one foe in base contact with the caster. Undead targets must take an immediate Leadership test - if passed all is well. If failed for every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. Non-Undead targets are mildly confused about what this gaunt stranger is doing but suffer no other effects. If no undead warbands are present in the campaign this spell may be re-rolled. |
| 5 | Services Unto Morr | Auto | No corpse is safe in Mordheim, even the burnt or buried. A Priest of Morr will safeguard the souls of the departed to ensure they are not abused by foul sorcery, and such dilligent work in service of their god earns them favour. The Priest gains +1 experience whenever an ally is permanently killed (excluding mounts).|
| 6 | Slip Away | 8 | Direct Damage. Priests of Morr are in the business of preserving the sanctity of death rather than the taking of life, and yet many Warriors dying agonizing deaths have been allowed mercy at the hands of a Priest of Morr who expediates the process. This magic does however have... practical uses. Slip Away targets a single enemy within 12" of the caster. For every wound the target is missing they take an additional wound with no armour saves allowed.|

##### Prayers of Ranald

Ranald, known by many names such as the Night Prowler, the God of Thieves or even the Trickster God, is the Human God of Luck, Fortune and Mischief. His is a curious cult for it lacks the trappings, the pomp and majesty, even the structure of other cults. His priests are thieves, tricksters, and gamblers, rather than the educated effete elite so favoured by others. His temples are the gaming halls, the brothels, the taverns, and other dens of iniquity, not the gilt structures of gold and marble. Indeed Ranald and his priests are unlike any others, a fact that is both distressing and delightful.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Thief's speed | 7 | Augment.  Until the start of the caster's next magic phase their Movement value is increased by 3. |
| 2 | Fool's Gold | 7 | Hex. With a brief mutter a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it. Nominate a spot within 12" of the caster. All unengaged enemy warband members within 6" of the target area must take a Leadership test. If failed then in their movement phase they will walk D6" towards the target, ending their movement (though they may still shoot as normal). This has no effect on Warriors who are Immune to Psychology, or on animals. |
| 3 | Lucky Guess | 7 | Hex. The Priest calls out a potentially scathing made-up insult at any enemy whose detection range (usually twice their initiative value) the Priest would be within. The target will gain the Frenzy special rule and Hates the Priest until the end of the battle. | 
| 4 | Whoops! | 4 | Hex. Whoops! targets a single enemy warrior within 24". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target treats all terrain as Dangerous Terrain. What horrible luck that they should happen to step on that one loose ladder rung, put their foot through that one rotted plank, or that a falling roofslate would happen to land exactly on their head. |
| 5 | What Fortune! | 11 | Augment. Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers, Priests that ask for direct wealth rarely meet with fortune. Or perhaps knowing that makes this all the riskier? If successfully cast the Priest immediately comes into posession of a Wyrdstone Shard. |
| 6 | Black Cat | 6 | Direct Damage. The caster may cast Black Cat on every enemy in base contact. As if from nowhere a small feral cat the caster just happened to have befriended earlier leaps from behind the Priest and directly onto the face of their assailants in a flurry of angry claws and fur, inflicting D6 S3 automatic hits on each enemy. Once resolved, the caster may disengage freely from combat D6" in any direction. If the spell fails to cast the cat does still appear, but simply watches in disinterest. |

##### Norse Runes

Norscan Shamans are an ecclectic bunch. With so many Norscan tribes shifting more towards the Hound, Serpent, Crow, and Eagle there are few practitioners left who keep to their more ancient and less corrupt traditions. As a result Shamans tend to be dour and conservative mystics, and the tribes they belong to view them with a quiet reverence.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Howl of the North | 9 | Augment. Icy winds sweep before the Shaman knocking missiles from their path. The Shaman is immune to all missile fire. Roll a dice during the Shaman’s recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the winds dissipate. |
| 2 | Angvar’s Fury | 7 | Augment. The Shaman’s howls rouses the anger of the warriors around him to a fever pitch. All warriors within 8" of the Shaman gain a +1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat. The spell lasts till the start of the Norse players next turn. |
| 3 | Elvek’s Cold Spear | 6 | Magic Missile. A razor sharp icicle flies at the Shaman’s foe. The icicle has a range of 18" and causes one S4 hit. Models wounded by the icicle are at 1 Initiative until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 4 | Gift of the Fates | 7 | Augment. The Shaman calls on the three Wyrd Sisters of Norse legend for a glimpse of the future. The Shaman may adjust any one die roll by any player by +/-1 between a successful casting of this rune & his next recovery phase. A to wound roll adjusted to or from 6 will not cause a critical. |
| 5 | Kiss of Frost | 6 | Direct Damage. The Shaman covers ground of his choosing with slick ice. A single model within 12" of the Shaman must pass an Initiative test or be knocked down. |
| 6 | Bear’s Might | 9 | Augment. The Shaman calls upon the spirits of the great Ice Bears of the North to aid him. The Shaman gains +1 Attack, +2 Strength, +2 Toughness and lose -2 Initiative (to a minimum of 1). Take a Leadership test at the beginning of each recovery phase. If the test fails, Bear’s Might drains away. |

##### Shadow Warrior Magic

Shadow Weavers use a strange blend of magic that differs in many ways to the traditional High Magic of their cousins of the Tower of Hoeth.

Author’s note: Several of the following spells mention that the target must be within a certain distance of ‘a wall’. This is not literally restricted to walls, but may include any piece of terrain that could be expected to cast a man-sized shadow.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Pool of Shadow | 7 | Augment. The area immediately surrounding the mage is suddenly filled with twisting shadows that make it nearly impossible to see anything inside. This spell allows the mage and all within 6" to Hide, exactly as if there were a wall or other obstruction between them and their enemies. They may Hide even after marching. This Hiding is disrupted if any enemy enters the area of affect. In addition, all affected count as being in cover against enemy shooting. This spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s next turn. |
| 2 | The Living Shadows | 7 | Direct Damage. Shadows around the target suddenly writhe as if alive and move to strike the victim. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 12" of the caster and within 2" of a wall. The target suffers a single Strength 4 hit with no armor saves. |
| 3 | Wings of Night | 6 | Augment. Wings of darkness unfurl from the Shadow Weaver’s back and engulf him. He disappears, only to reappear in nearby shadow. This spell may only be cast if the Shadow Weaver is within 2" of a wall. He is instantly moved up to 12" to a place that is also within 2" of a wall. If moved into contact with an enemy model, the Shadow Weaver counts as charging in the first round. |
| 4 | Cloak of Darkness | 7 | Augment. The Shadow Weaver appears to be swallowed by shadows that even the sharpest senses cannot pierce. The Shadow Weaver is effectively concealed from enemy sight. As long as he does not attack (cast spells, shoot, or engage in close combat) any enemy models, he may not be attacked. He may intercept as normal if the player controlling him wishes, but he does not have to do so (and if he does not, enemy warriors may charge past him of course). The spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver attacks an enemy model. Note that a model engaged in close combat with an enemy warrior may never choose to not attack. |
| 5 | Shadowbind | 9 | Hex. Tendrils of darkness rise from the shadows to engulf an enemy warrior, rendering him helpless to the whims of the Shadow Weaver. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell at any enemy model within 24" of him and 2" of a wall. The target may not move unless it first passes a Strength test on 2D6 at the start of his turn (before the Recovery Phase). This spell lasts until the Shadow Weaver suffers a Wound or attempts to cast another spell. If attacked while affected by this spell, treat the target exactly as if he were Stunned. |
| 6 | Shield of Shadow | 7 | Augment. Shadows congeal and become a solid barrier in front of the Shadow Weaver or one of their comrades, protecting the target from enemy attacks. The Shadow Weaver may cast this spell on themself or a member of their warband within 12". The target receives a 5+ Ward save. The spell lasts until the start of the Shadow Weaver’s next turn. |

##### Fey Magic

Wood elf magic draws upon the raw forces of nature granting the mage the ability to wield some of its primordial power.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Nourish | 6 | Augment. In the caster's next magic phase, in which they would usually channel, they automatically gain 1 more channeling dice than normal. A wizard who unsuccessfully channels for example would still get 1 bonus dice to cast/dispel with. |
| 2 | The Green Eye | 9 | Direct Damage. The wizard projects a bolt of mystic green energy 18" long and 1" wide that ignores terrain and obstructions. Any model who’s base is even partially under this line must roll under their Initiative or suffer d3 S4 hits. |
| 3 | Hunting Spear | 10 | Magic Missile. 24" range S5, causes D3 Multiple Wounds. |
| 4 | Thorn Call | 8 | Hex. Thick Vines sprout out of the ground tearing and ensnaring its victim. This spell has a range of 12". The spell may be cast on a single enemy model entrapping the victim in constricting thorny vines. The target may test to see if they can get free at the start of their next turn by rolling equal or under their strength value. If they fail they suffers a strength 4 hit as the thorns wound them as they struggle. |
| 5 | Ariel’s Blessing | 9 | Augment spell. Tendrils and Vines burst from the Mages arm binding and embracing a fallen warrior, filling them with life and returning them to their feet filled with the power of the forest. The Mage may put any model who has been taken out of action back on their feet ready for action as if they had never been taken out. Note if the mage himself has been taken out of action they may not bring himself back to the battle. Friendly models taken out of action are left on the board where they perished and the mage may only bring them back to life if they are in base to base contact.
| 6 | Eagle’s cry | 8 | Augment Spell. The caster utters shrill, piercing cry of the legendary Great Eagle Thuarindir, inspiring their allies. All elves within 6” gain +1 on to hit and +1 on the critical hit table until the start of the caster's next magic phase.

##### Lesser magic

Those who have not been schooled in the ways of magic can cast only relatively simple spells. Many human wizards,
lacking the tradition of sorcery and the grimoires of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, have to rely on their own natural
aptitude and experimentation. Lesser Magic (or hedge magic) is used by human warlocks, though can be used by experimental researchers curious to study its effects. It may not be as awesome as the mighty spells of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, but it is still dangerous.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Fires of U’Zhul | 7 | Magic Missile. The wizard summons a fiery ball of flames and hurls it upon their enemies.
The fireball has a range of 18" and causes one Strength 4 hit. |
| 2 | Flight of Zimmeran | 7 | Augment. Calling upon the power of the winds of magic, the wizard walks on air. The wizard may immediately move anywhere within 12", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case they count as charging. If they engage a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase they will score 1 automatic hit and then their opponent will flee again (if they survive). |
| 3 | Dread of Aramar | 7 | Hex. The wizard places a sense of mind-numbing fear into the minds of their opponents.
A single model within 12" of the wizard must pass a Leadership test or flee 2D6" directly away from them. If they flee, they must test at the start of each of his own movement phases and will continue to flee until they pass a test. This spell has no effect on warriors that are Immune to Psychology. |
| 4 | Silver Arrows of Arha | 7 | Magic Missile. The wizard's ranged weapon's ammunition begins to glow with a shimmering white light, and when discharged these spread out into a wide cone of tiny needle-like shards. The next time the wizard would fire a ranged weapon the target takes an additional D6 S3 hits. If the wizard is incapable of ever using a ranged weapon this spell may be re-rolled. |
| 5 | Mirror Image | 7 | Hex. Mirror Image targets any area within 24" of the caster. An illusionary version of the caster appears in that location under the caster's control. It shares the caster's movement speed but has a 1 in every other stat. It may not attack enemies, may not gather treasure, and any hit against it will immediately cause it to disappear and award no experience. |
| 6 | Sword of Rezhebel | 9 | Augment. The wizard's weapon (or weapons) transmute into a single blazing longsword, granting the wizard +1 Attack, +2 Strength, and +2 Weapon Skill. Take a Leadership test at the beginning of each of the wizard’s own turns. If the test fails, the sword disappears. |

##### Dark Elf Magic

The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High Elves specialise in the more subtle manipulations of a battlefield, the Dark Elves prefer the use of overwhelming power. Their spells are difficult to maintain but highly destructive.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Doombolt | 9 | Magic Missile. Whispering an ancient incantation the Sorceress conjures a bolt of pure dark energy and unleashes it from her outstretched hand. Doombolt has an 18" range and causes a Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 6" is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per spellcast. |
| 2 | Word of Pain | 9 | Hex. The Sorceress calls the curse of the Witch King down on her enemy, reducing their willingness to fight. The spell may be cast at an enemy model within 12". The victim must re-roll all successful to hit and to wound rolls. Lasts until the beginning of the next Dark Elf turn. |
| 3 | Soul Stealer | 9 | Direct Damage. Soul Stealer may be cast on a single enemy in base contact, inflicting a single wound with no saves of any kind allowed. The Sorceress feeds on this life-force and adds one wound to her profile, potentially taking her above her starting maximum. This bonus disappears after the battle. |
| 4 | Bittershard | 9 | Hex. The caster may target a single enemy within 12". A dense and jagged sensation emerges within the pit of their stomach as black crystals begin to sprout beneath their skin, agonizingly growing and spreading outwards. For the rest of the battle the victim takes a single S2 hit in each of their recovery phases. This effect does not stack if cast again at the same target. |
| 5 | Deathspasm | 10 | Direct Damage. The Sorceress channels Dark Magic into her enemy, causing them to writhe in excruciating pain. The Deathspasm has a range of 6" and must be cast on the closest enemy model. The affected model must roll on the injury chart. |

##### Necromancy

Necromancy is the practice of reanimating the dead, typically done by binding souls to the inanimate bodies. This is not always necessarily the case however, and while there are tales of vindictive necromancers binding spirits to mundane objects like chairs or candles the Tomb Kings are famous for their use of constructs to house souls.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Lifestealer | 9 | Direct Damage. The Necromancer sucks out the very essence of life from their victim, stealing its vigour for himself. You may choose a single model within 6". The target suffers a wound with no armour save allowed and the Necromancer gains an extra wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the Necromancer’s Wounds above his original maximum value. |
| 2 | Re-Animation | 5 | Augment. At the spoken command of the Necromancer, the dead rise to fight again. One Zombie that went out of action during the last hand-to-hand combat or Shooting phase immediately returns to the battle. Place the model within 6" of the Necromancer. The model cannot be placed straight into hand-to-hand combat with an enemy model. |
| 3 | Death vision | 6 | Augment. The Necromancer calls on the power of Necromancy to reveal the moment of his enemies’ death. The Necromancer causes Terror for the duration of the battle. |
| 4 | Romejo's Awakening | 8 | Direct Damage. The Necromancer whispers to the sleeping dead to rise up from the ground and seize their enemies. Choose one enemy model within 12". The model must immediately roll equal to or less than their Strength on a D6 or the dead emerging from the earth will rend him with supernatural power. If they fail, you may roll on the Injury table to see what happens to the unfortunate warrior. Has no effect on creatures Large or greater. |
| 5 | Call of Vanhel | 10 | Augment. The Necromancer summons the world of the dead to invigorate their Undead servants.
All Undead allies within 6" of the Necromancer immediately make a free move - including charging. |
6 Spell of Awakening | Auto | The Necromancer calls the soul of a slain Hero back to his body and enslaves him with corrupt magic. If an enemy Hero is killed (i.e., your opponent rolls 11-16 on the Serious Injury chart after the battle) then the Necromancer may raise him to fight as a Zombie in his servitude. The dead Hero retains his characteristics and all his weapons and armor but may not use any other equipment or skills. He may no longer run, counts as a Henchman group on his own, and may not gain additional experience. This spell always succeeds (rules for Henchmen and experience are described later). The new Zombie follows all the normal Zombie rules (immune to poison, causes fear) except for retaining his profile, weapons and armor. |

##### Chaos Rituals

Chaos rituals are the sorcerous acts performed by aspirant wizards who seek to earn favour with the Dark Gods. Typically these magisters are unaligned or at least have yet to discover their true calling, though they are universally insane. Nevertheless Chaos Rituals are a dark and disturbing thing to behold, bringing about violent change as often as liquefying destruction.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Revelation | 10 | Direct Damage. The caster may target a single enemy model within 6". The victim is assaulted with glimpses into the unknowable cosmic truth of Chaos, of geometrically impossible universes and shown exactly how minescule they are within that world. The affected model is immediately stunned. This spell has no effect on models that cannot gain experience, since they don't really understand what they're looking at. |
| 2 | Eye of the Gods | 7 | Augment. There is nothing that earns the favour of a Chaos God more than the keeping of a particularly brutal promise. The caster may nominate a single allied Hero within 6", including themself. If in the combat phase the Augmented Hero puts an enemy Hero _Out of Action_ they and the caster will both gain +1 experience point. |
| 3 | Dark Blood | 8 | Direct Damage. This attack uses the flame template at S5. Upon attempting to cast this spell, the sorceror slices their palm and like an erupting geyser a wash of boiling black blood gushes out to crash over their opponents. Whether their spellcast is successful or not, the caster must take an injury roll. |
| 4 | Lure of Chaos | 9 | Hex. The Chaos Mage calls upon the taint of chaos which exists in the inner soul of all living beings. The spell has a range of 12". Roll a D6 and add the caster's Leadership to the score. Then roll a D6 and add the target’s Leadership to the score. If the Chaos Mage beats their opponent’s score they gain control of the model until the model passes a Leadership test in their own recovery phase. The model may not commit suicide, but can attack models on their own side, and will not fight warriors from the caster’s warband. If they were engaged in hand-to-hand combat with any warriors of the caster’s warband, they will immediately move 1" apart. |
| 5 | Warpstep | 9 | Augment. With a cursed utterance the fabric of reality tears just enough for the caster to slip through. The caster may immediately move anywhere within 24", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case they count as charging. Travelling however briefly through the demonic realm is extremely dangerous however, so after resolving the spell roll a D6. On a 1 a Bloodletter has followed them through on the other side and is placed in combat with the caster as if it had charged them. |
| 6 | Soulsurge | 9 | Magic Missile. Soulsurge has a range of 18" and is Strength 5. Before rolling to wound the caster may choose to sacrifice any number of toughness points for the rest of the game. For each toughness point sacrificed in this way the attack, if it succeeds in wounding, deals an additional wound. |
