### Starting a Warband

Before you begin to play you must recruit a warband to take part in the battle for Mordheim. The warbands are represented by a whole range of Citadel models available as boxed sets and blister packs. The boxed sets are designed to form an ideal starting point for your collection and further models can be added as your warband grows and thrives.

In this section of the book we take a detailed look at each of the warbands and provide the information you need to recruit a warband of that type.

Use the lists that follow to recruit and equip your warband
(an example warband has been included at the back of the
book.) You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model and
their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount
of money. As you make your choices, subtract the money you
have “spent” from your total until you have bought all you
can. Any unspent gold crowns are put into the warband’s
treasury and can be used later or hoarded to buy something
more expensive.
To start with you must recruit at least three warriors
including a leader. The weapons, armor and mutations you
choose for your warriors must be represented on the models
themselves. The exceptions are knives and daggers, which
you may assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing
if not represented on the model.

#### Skill tables and starting experience

The warband lists also include information about the starting
experience of the warriors and which skills they can choose
as they progress in the game. Some warbands also include
separate skill lists unique to the warband.
The rules about experience and skills will be fully explained
in the Campaign section, so don’t worry about them for now.

#### Heroes and henchmen

For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.

#### Heroes

These are exceptional individuals who have the potential to
become legends. Heroes can be armed and equipped
individually and may carry any special equipment they might
pick up during the campaign.

#### Leader

Every warband must have a leader. He represents you, the
player. He makes the decisions and leads your warriors
through the dark streets of Mordheim.

#### Other heroes

Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to five
other Heroes, who form the core of your warband. A warband
may never include more Heroes of any specific type than the
number given in the Warband list. This means that some
warbands can only get the maximum of six Heroes by
gaining experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).

#### Henchmen

Henchmen typically fall into two groups. There are
Henchmen such as the Brethren of the Possessed, Skaven
Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen. These Henchmen
gain experience and become better as time goes by. They are
bought in groups of one to five models.

The other type of Henchmen are those such as War hounds
and Zombies. These are too dim or too primitive to gain
experience.
Henchmen may never use any special equipment you acquire
during their adventures (unless otherwise noted); only Heroes
may do so. Henchmen can include potentially powerful
warriors, but Heroes always have an edge over them with
their potential to gain extra experience.
All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group, which usually
consists of between one and five individuals. Henchmen
groups gain experience collectively and gain advances
together.
#### Weapons and armor

Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two close
combat weapons (in addition to his free dagger), up to two
different missile weapons and any armor chosen from the
appropriate list. For these purposes, a brace of pistols counts
as a single missile weapon. Warriors may be restricted in
regard to which types of weapons they can use. The
warband’s equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is
available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and armor
when starting a warband, as indicated by the list in the
warband’s entry, but after playing the first game the only way
to get further rare weapons and armor is to roll to see if you
can locate them (see the Trading section).
You may buy additional equipment between battles, but your
warriors can only use the weapons and armor listed in their
warband entry. As they accumulate experience and gain
skills, Heroes may learn to use weapons other than those
initially available to them.
Every model in each Henchman group must be armed and
armored in the same way. This means that if your
Henchman group has four warriors, and you want to buy
them swords, you must buy four swords.
#### Warband roster

You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of
your warband. Blank roster sheets can be found printed at the
back of this book, one for Heroes and one for Henchman
groups. We suggest that you photocopy or copy as many
sheets as you need, so that you can keep a neat and accurate
record of your warband as it changes from game to game.
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and
write down the details of each Hero and Henchman group in
the appropriate places. You’ll notice that Heroes and
Henchmen have slightly different spaces provided to reflect
the different ways in which they gain experience and use
weapons, armor and equipment.
It is a good idea to work out the warband on a piece of scrap
paper first, as you will have to juggle the weapons and
fighters to get as close to the maximum permitted value of the
warband as possible. If you have any cash left after choosing
your warband write this down in the space marked as
‘Treasury’. At the end of the book you’ll find an example
warband; you can use this if you want or choose your own –
it’s up to you.

The warband roster is a record of your brave group of
warriors and is useful to keep beside you as you play. During
a battle you may wish to make notes on the sheet itself, to
record details such as extra experience, equipment used, etc.
You will need to give your warband a name, and also name
all your Heroes and each Henchman group. It’s up to you to
invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of
inspiration throughout this book.

#### Calculate the warband rating

Each warband has a warband rating – the higher the rating,
the better the warband. The warband rating is simply the
number of warriors multiplied by 5, plus their accumulated
experience.
Large creatures such as Rat Ogres are worth 20 points plus
the number of Experience points they have accumulated.
#### Ready for battle

The warband is now ready to start its fighting career!


### Warbands

#### Mercenaries

This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For
warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of
wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men
from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple
of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders
for the Emperor’s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the
Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three
contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are fighting for.
Warbands from different places will vary in many respects,
offering different benefits as well as having a unique
appearance and character.

##### Reikland

Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is
Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the
Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of
Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the
Empire. The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler
of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the
throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed
to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional
warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders
disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and
practical wargear. In battle they often wear coloured ribbons
as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud
of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and
contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they
sneeringly call the ‘lap-dog of Ulric’.
Special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the demands of
military discipline and have a strongly developed loyalty
between officers and men. To represent this, fighters may use
their Captain’s Leadership if within 12" rather than the usual
6".
A strong tradition of martial training is also responsible for
the high standards of archery amongst the people of
Reikland. All Marksmen therefore add +1 to their Ballistic
Skill, whether they are recruited when the Warband is first
formed or added later.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Middenheim

Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle surrounded by
dark forest in the centre of Middenland, and is also known as
the City of the White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves
and winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of the
city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim and

Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the Count of
Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one of the chief
contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a result there has
always been a great deal of friction between Middenheimers
and the Temple of Sigmar.
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men with a
well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts
which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain
a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are
famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into
battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons
of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look
especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies
howling their brutal battle-cries.
Special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and bulk, the
Champions and Captains of a Middenheim warband start
with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### Marienburg

Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in
the Old World. Many call it the City of Gold which alone
conveys a good idea of the wealth of this sprawling
cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can be found the vast array
of shops selling goods from as far away as the Elven
kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west and distant Cathay in the
east. The city’s craftsmen represent every skill known to
man, and a few others beside, so that it is said in Marienburg
there is no activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit.
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High Order
of Honourable Freetraders which represents the elite amongst
mercantile society. This large, rich, and ambitious body of
men feel themselves shackled by the old order and are eager
to seize power for themselves. Their champion for the
Emperor’s throne is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen
influence of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady Magritta’s
claim. It was only the Grand Theogonist’s refusal to crown
her that denied Marienburg the throne driving a wedge
between the City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed and
armed. Though Marienburgers are often ridiculed as foppish
and effete, their skill at arms and complete ruthlessness has
earned them grudging respect. Their chief skills lie in
duelling and in the use of poisons and other clandestine
fighting methods. Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and
wear jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather coats,
bandanas and short swords that are easy to conceal.
Special rules


As natural traders with contacts in the merchant guilds
Marienburg warbands receive a +1 bonus when attempting to
find rare items (see the Trading section for rules).
To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start off with
an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when fighting in a
campaign. In a one-off game they are permitted an extra 20%
gold crowns when recruiting a warband. For example, in a
1,000 gold crown game a Marienburger warband will have
1,200gc.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Choice of warriors

A Mercenary warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns available to spend. The
maximum number of warriors in the warband may never
exceed 15.

Captain: Each Mercenary warband must have one Captain:
no more, no less!
Champions: Your warband may include up to two
Champions.
Youngbloods: Your warband may include up to two
Youngbloods.
Warriors: Your warband may include any number of
Warriors.
Marksmen: Your warband may include no more than seven
Marksmen.
Swordsmen: Your warband may include no more than five
Swordsmen.

1 Mercenary Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
A Mercenary Captain is a tough professional warrior, a man who
will fight for anyone or against anything so long as the price is
right. Mordheim offers such a man the chance to become rich
beyond his dreams, though at great risk. But as ruthlessness and
lack of mercy and pity are the hallmarks of a successful Mercenary
Captain, it is no wonder that they flock to Mordheim.

0-2 Champions
35 gold crowns to hire
In any Mercenary warband there is one warrior who is bigger,
stronger (and often uglier) than his comrades. These men are called
Champions (or berserkers, first swordsmen and various other
names). Champions are amongst the toughest and the best fighters
in the warband. They often answer challenges issued to the warband
and, after the Captain, they get the pick of any equipment and loot.

#### Averlander

Averland lies in the south of the Empire, between the rivers
Aver and Upper Reik and borders upon the Black Mountains
and the huge range that is the Worlds Edge Mountains. It’s a
prosperous province, though it’s neither one of the largest or
most influential in the Empire. The Black Mountains and the
World Edge Mountains harbour plenty of mines, many are in
Dwarf possession. The metal ore is sold at a good profit in
Averheim, the provincial capital, to merchants from Nuln,
who transport it on barges down the river Aver. The
mountains contain several ancient Dwarf strongholds but
Night Goblins or Skaven has overrun several of them, while
others have been lost in violent volcanic eruptions.
The Black Fire Pass guards an important trade route between
the Borderlands and the Empire; it divides the World Edge
Mountains from the Black Mountains. The route is an old
Dwarf road and extends past Averheim and further north into
the Empire. Goods from the Black Fire pass are usually
shipped along the Aver River to Nuln. The pass is the only
place to cross the mountains, as the mountainsides are
extremely steep and almost impossible to pass. Not to
mention that the weather is notoriously unpredictable and few
dare risk being caught in a snow blizzard or avalanche. As if
things weren’t bad enough the mountains are home to fierce
tribes of Night Goblins, Trolls, Skaven and legendary
monsters. Some daring adventurers have made a living off
stealing eggs from the tallest peaks and selling them to the
Imperial Zoo. These beasts will be brought up to become
mounts for famous generals.
Averland is a rich province and as a result exorbitant sums of
money are spent on the uniforms of the state soldiers.
Seasoned veterans prefer flamboyant uniforms to make them
stand out compared to the peasant, but also to reflect their
seniority. This tradition has seeped down through the ranks to
a point where even the militia and mercenary bands strive to
have as flamboyant clothing as they can afford. The
Averlander army is said to employ enough tailors to supply a
small city! Outsiders joke that the Averlanders are such great
archers because they do not want to get up close and personal
as they risk tearing or bloodying their clothes. Such remarks
are hushed down in the presence of a veteran of the Black
Fire Pass though, or else the jester will soon find himself in
the gutter with a few missing teeth. The practice of wearing
outrageous clothing has certainly appealed to the diminutive
race of Halflings and tailors are constantly being asked to
shorten sleeves and add a little extra width to the waist. Many

Young recruits are disheartened to learn that they are
disallowed from wearing the stunning uniform until they
have served at least a year in the army. These ‘Youngbloods’
are by no means regarded as professional soldiers yet and
have to make do with more simple clothing.
The Bergjaeger are a special detachment of the Black Fire
Pass guard that is made up of trappers and rangers from the
surrounding mountains. They are experts at moving silently
through rocky terrain and are often used as scouts. The
background of a ranger is as varied as there are rangers, and
most of them have a story to tell. Some were gamekeepers
who have lost their job or found it too uninspiring.
Somewhere poachers press-ganged into the army to avoid
serving prison time. Some might have been rustlers who
decided to flee to the militia when the angry farmers came
too close to catching him. Whatever their background they
are expert marksmen and well suited to a life in the bleak
mountain wilderness.
##### Special Rules

Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the

1 Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
The Captain of a mercenary warband is typically a middle-aged
veteran soldier of the Imperial army, most likely he was a sergeant
or other petty officer. The survival of a mercenary warband relies
more on the wit and experience of its captain, than on how good a
fighter he is. It’s all too common that an inexperienced captain will
lead his men into an ambush, or lead them on a long journey with
no food or supplies. Being a successful captain means that your men
will follow you to hell and back, and plenty of gold crowns and
feasting. A captain that fails in his duty to keep his men alive and
well fed will at best find himself deserted and worst end up with a
knife in his back.

35 gold crowns to hire
Some captains are merchants or nobles that are looking for a
chance at making some extra money. The brighter captains hire the
service of a veteran as his sergeant, and leave all the practical
decision to him. A veteran can be recognised by his many battle-
scars and the cynicism that marks a soldier of the army.

0-2 Bergjaeger
35 gold crowns to hire
The Bergjaeger are trappers and rangers from the mountains that
surround the Black Fire pass. They are experts at moving silently
through terrain and are used as scouts. In addition they make good
use of animal traps to delay or divide a group of enemies.
Bergjaeger are not professional soldiers and rely more on stealth
and cunning than a strong sword-arm to survive.

Set Traps: Bergjaeger are expert trappers and hunters and
these skills can be put to great use in the ruins of Mordheim.
A Bergjaeger may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing
else (he may not set traps if he’s just recovered from being
Knocked Down). Place a marker in base contact with the
Bergjaeger. When a model, friend or foe, moves within 2" of
the marker he risks setting off the trap – roll a D6. On a score
of 3+ he has triggered the trap and suffers a S4 hit (note that
the Bergjaeger won’t trigger his own traps). If the trap did not
wound the model or it didn’t trigger, the ‘victim’ may finish
his move otherwise he is placed knocked Down or Stunned
2" from the marker. Regardless whether the trap was
triggered or not, the marker is removed.

0-1 Youngblood
15 gold crowns to hire
Although Empire armies are comprised of mature men there are
plenty of jobs for youths as there is always a demand for extra help
in the kitchens or as fetchers. Some of these youths actually join a
band of mercenaries or regiment in pursuit of a romantic dream of
fame and adventure. Some are herdsmen who hoped to find an
easier way of filling their belly than the hard and uncertain business
of looking after animals, not to mention that its quite dull!

(Brought in groups of 1-5)
Mountainguard
30 gold crowns to hire
The Mountainguard is the famous garrison of the Black Fire Pass
that has repelled countless greenskin invasion attempts. Their
traditional uniform is yellow and black and it’s a merit in the
Averland army to have served a few years at the mountain-pass. The
Mountain guard train both with the traditional Imperial weapons,
the halberd and the sword, and with the crossbow and bow.
Veterans are often employed by mercenary warbands who know that
their presence will certainly boost their chances in the battles to
come. Some of these veterans advance to become sergeants or even
captains themselves. There are a few warbands that consists solely
of Mountainguard veterans, often from the same regiment or the
survivors of a great battle.

Marksmen

Being a Marksmen is not as simple as picking up a bow and try to
hit your enemies. A Marksman has to train for years to master his
chosen weapon, Imperial enlisters often visit archery competitions
to try and enlist a couple of expert archers. Some Marksmen are
trained with black powder weapons instead of the traditional bow or
crossbow. Marksmen often own their own weapons, as the cost of a
handgun is as high as hiring the Marksman himself! Thus the
Marksmen are not forced to do as much hard labour as the militia.

pass and the Moot was devastated. Ever since then the Moot urge
their gamekeepers to serve at least a few years in the garrison that
guard the pass. If another warlord tries to invade the Moot, they will
meet the fierce resistance of the Halflings in the mountain Pass.

#### Ostlander

‘My only crime was to get in a brawl with some pig farmer outside of the Donkey’s Nut Tavern and the next thing I knew a
dozen of his brothers were after my blood.’ Udo Verkonnen, Freesword
The Principality of Ostland is the most sparsely inhabited of
all of the Empire’s Electoral Provinces. Its people have more
ties with the land of Kislev to the north than they do to their
countrymen to the south. This is because the Forest of
Shadows and the Middle Mountains form two natural barriers
between Ostland and the rest of the Empire. Within the Forest
of Shadows are vast amounts of wild game but also darker
creatures such as Chaos Beastmen and Forest Goblins. The
Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the
Empire and their peaks are inhabited by a large number of
Ogres.
Ostland’s isolation has greatly shaped its inhabitants and they
are a poor but hardy folk. Each small village lives barely
above subsistence levels and is usually composed of one
large extended family. The men of Ostland are tall and broad-
shouldered while the women tend to either be tall and
whippet thin or short and stout. Married men are usually dirt
farmers who also gather roots, tubers and nuts in the forests,
while unmarried men spend their lives as trappers and
hunters. The worship of Taal, the God of Forests and Beasts,
is very popular in the region although there is some worship
of Taal’s wife Ryha and his brother Ulric in the more
westerly villages.
While not warlike by nature, Ostlanders are never opposed to
a good honest drunken brawl and with their love of dark ales
these sorts of scraps are not uncommon. During the Great
War against Chaos, Ostlanders rallied in great numbers to
wield bow and spear in defence of their Kislevite neighbours.
More than any other part of the Empire, Ostland has tasted
the lash of Chaos and their hatred of the evil ones knows no
bounds.

##### Special Rules

Self-Sufficient: The men of Ostland have no desire to give
their hard-earned gold to outsiders. As a result they can never
hire any Mercenaries except for Ogres (who are not an
uncommon sight in Ostland).
Nouveau Riche: Ostlanders are almost universally poor.
Many Ostlanders never see coined money in their entire life
and those that do are often overcome with giddiness at the
mere sight of wealth. As a result, Ostlanders MUST sell all of
their Wyrdstone (unless they have more than 8 pieces in
which case they must only sell 8) after every battle and after
hiring new warriors (which may be done first) at least 50% of
the remaining gold MUST be spent on a single item of gear.
This means that Ostlander Warbands will often be composed
of a dozen men wearing muddy peasant garb with one
member wearing golden-laid heavy armor and another
carrying a double-barrelled hunting rifle from the finest
forges of Hochland.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### Choice of Warriors

An Ostlander Warband is often made up of an extended
family of Ostlanders. Fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins and
even the occasion tough-as-nails aunt all join together to form
the Warband. The ‘family’ must include a minimum of 3
models and a maximum of 15. You have 500 Gold Crowns
that you can use to recruit your initial warband.
Elder: Each Ostlander Warband must have one Elder, no
more, no less!
Blood-Brothers: Your Warband may include up to 2 Blood-
Brothers.
Priest of Taal: Your Warband may include up to 1 Priest of
Taal.

forest have begun to join bands of Ostlanders in their delvings into

More than anywhere in the Empire Ogres are most commonplace
within the hilly, pine forested landscape of Ostland. These brutish
creatures are very sought after by the rough mountain men of
Ostland as muscle in the Warband. An Ogre’s strength is near
legendary and their ability to sustain an awful lot of punishment
during a fight make these the perfect shock troops of any Warband.
Of course, an Ogre’s appetite is nearly as well renowned as their
fighting abilities and so they are rather expensive to keep.

Some Ostlander men choose not to marry but instead to spend their
times alone in the forests of the Old World. While these rangers do
not share the close family bonds of a typical Ostlander Blood-kin
they are well respected for their knowledge of the woods and their
rugged determination. Poor Jaeger usually wield a simple home-
made bow but it is every Jaeger’s dream to one day own a

behaviour is often misconstrued into a false belief that they are

Leadership based tests they are required to take.
No Respect: Ruffians are objects of a strange mix of pity and
abject fear for their fellows and may never become a
Warband leader.


#### Nuln Engineers

Based on Imperial Gunnery School of Nuln from the Nemesis Crown and Nuln Engineers By Josh Alexander
The Province of Nuln is renowned throughout the Empire as
a centre of commerce and knowledge, especially in the field
of engineering, the home to the finest handguns and war
machines, save for those constructed by the Dwarves. The
Imperial Gunnery School located there trains apprentices in
the intricacies of weapon design and maintenance, and is
crucial to the dominance of the armies of the Empire. The
relatively new science of black powder technology is
relentlessly researched and tested in Nuln, borrowing theories
from dwarf engineers and developing new ones through sheer
human ingenuity.
Nuln produces the majority of the cannons and other artillery
desired commodity used by the Empire army. In addition,
most of the handguns and pistols are manufactured in the city
as well. Its garrison is therefore unusually well armed, and
most enemies would rather mount an expedition into the
chaos wastes than an assault on Nuln.
Most of the students at the school come from the Imperial nobility,
sons who show talents in mathematics or an interest in things that
go boom, as well as not being immediately in line for succession.
Once they graduate, students are given the choice of staying in the
school for further studies (and eventually becoming a Master
Gunner) or returning home. For some the prospect of yet more
years of studies will send them home where they will go on to fight
as an army’s pistoleers or outriders, the others do attain their
pinnacle and get to watch their former trainees charge across the
battlefield, often to their deaths.
Mordheim presents an irresistible opportunity to the aged
scholars of Nuln, as the mysterious wyrdstone is said to have
many useful properties. The few shards that have found their
way to Nuln have successfully been used in the creation of
more efficient black powder, as well as the basis of a new
alloy for gunmetal and cannonballs. However, the high cost
the shards accrue on the secondary market makes them a rare
and expensive commodity. Rather than entrust their interests
to the mercenary rabble that wander the lands of the Empire,
the Master Engineers of Nuln have sent out several Engineers
to fetch as many shards of wyrdstone as they can carry. In
their eyes, it is cheaper to simply replace a warband
slaughtered in the ruins than to pay the extra amount for the
scant wyrdstone that is available. These engineers gather
together some of their students and a few city guard and
depart, taking pains to bring along plenty of weapons and
ammunition. While less than pleased at their new occupation,
the engineers owe their very livelihood to the Master
Engineers of Nuln, and grudgingly comply with their edicts.
Engineer warbands are unusual, even for the eclectic rabble
that fights in the ruins. While they employ a few soldiers for
their practical knowledge, most of the groups consist of
academic, scholarly individuals. Many of these scientists
have served in the armies of the Empire and have military
training, rusty though it may be. Some leaders underestimate
the danger they present, for what they lack in ferocity and
strength they make up for with sheer firepower. It is usually
easy to determine if a Nuln warband is fighting nearby,
because the gunshots echo through the deserted ruins and can
be heard even from outside the city walls.

##### Special Rules

Impeccable Care: Amongst one of the first things that the
students are taught is to take proper care of their equipment
and the right way to perform that maintenance. Once they
have mastered this function, they learn to repair the same
weapons should they become damaged and because of this
they can buy such black powder weapons on the cheap and
quickly return them to good working order. As a result they
can buy these weapons at a fairly reduced price! They can
ALWAYS use the reduced cost for black powder weapons
listed in their starting Equipment List, and they gain an
additional +2 on rare rolls to find any black powder weapons
since people don’t mind selling broken guns!
Properly Used: The students know the proper way to use
their weapons, spending many hours on the school’s shooting
range. This is considered to be a good use of time between
lessons and recommended by all the school’s instructors,
after all if the students constantly blow themselves up with
their weapons, there wouldn’t be many graduates. When
using the optional Misfire rules, if a one is rolled, roll a
second dice. On a 3+ the misfire is ignored (the shot still
misses, but the weapon does NOT explode).
Proud To A Fault!: Anyone studying at the Imperial
Gunnery School is very proud of this fact, as it is a great
honour to be accepted. After they start using black powder
weapons, students recognise the superiority of these weapons
and refuse to bend their knee to the ‘lesser’ ranged weapons.
The members of this warband NEVER use any non-black
powder ranged weapons (this prohibition does NOT apply to
hired swords or dramatis personae, as they are hired help and
have not received proper Nuln training).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Heroes

1 Engineer
65 gold crowns to hire
Engineers oversee the training of apprentices and are always
exacting and precise. They epitomize the technological innovation of
Nuln, and their aim is usually as keen as their intellect. Instead of
dominating their warbands with fear or brute force, Engineers earn
respect through their experience and technical knowledge.

closest target.

0-1 Instructor
45 gold crowns to hire
The gunners of Nuln are the most respected in the Old World. They
are in charge of keeping up the mighty Empire war machines such
as the great cannons. They are well educated and extensively
trained, but not yet too battle-hardened, so these excursions give
them field experience, even in the smallest things.

Orphans left on the doorsteps of the school, well cared for and
trained to take care of the constructs as apprentices and assistants.
Many go on to form gun crews for the cannons taken into battle and
some even rise as far as commanding such crews. For the most part
they remain a background element to the successful workings of any
cannon or black powder weapon and have become an essential part
of the school. On the excursions, sons of the guns provide a much
needed set of arms to carry provisions and spare powder, as well as
providing much needed additional firepower in a fight.

weapon other than a blunderbuss, roll a die. On a 4+, the gun
is automatically reloaded and does not have to miss a turn
before being able to fire again.


#### Cult of the Possessed

There is never any shortage of men willing to risk their lives
for a chance of real power: men whose ambitions lie beyond
the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or
physical deformities place them in constant danger of
persecution. What do such men have to lose if they pledge
their souls to the dark gods of Chaos! In the aftermath of the
destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have
appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the
stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical
gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of
the Witch Hunters.
Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims
lordship of the City of the Damned. He is called the
Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the
cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their
souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or
Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do
his bidding.
As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of
magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to
stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that proliferates in
Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all
natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once
men but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods
they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their
appearance is horrific – corrupted from within, their flesh is
twisted into a new and monstrous form.
With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers
of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. In the
Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of the Possessed ambushed
and destroyed a large force sent in to hunt them down. Now
the streets of Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his
servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at all or,
more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption. Men who
venture into Mordheim alone are hunted down and sacrificed
to the dark gods. All warbands of the Possessed gather
wyrdstone for the Shadowlord who remains hidden in the Pit
where he is said to be guarded by titanic Possessed the size of

houses. A few shards of the precious stone are kept by the
warbands and used to create more of the Possessed.
The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and each
leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark gods of Chaos.
These are men whose hunger for power knows no bounds,
who willingly give their bodies over to possession. All take
part in the blood sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of
Daemons – nothing is too base for them! These degenerate
humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they – things
half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors, and which men
refer to as Beastmen.
There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband. Deranged
warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave jagged weapons
and chant blasphemous rites as they throw themselves upon
their foes. Many are hardly recognisable as human, their
bodies are so scarred and disfigured. The stigmata of
mutation is borne by most, but the most unsettling of all are
the Possessed themselves – melded flesh made of men,
beasts, and metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon.
##### Special Rules

Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is always Chaotic.
##### Choice of warriors

A Possessed warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial

lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches
of the Realm of Chaos.
The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several creatures
together, be they men or animals, into a multi-faceted horror. These

dreadful.

#### The Carnival of Chaos

No one knows from whence it came, the dreaded Carnival of
Chaos. Some have rumoured that it was once a gypsy caravan
from the east of the Empire, wandering folk that brought their
colourful fare from village to village entertaining the poor
rural folk of the Empire with their lavish shows and stage
plays. If this past is the truth then what it has become in the
present is far more sinister and deadly. Still it wanders the
rural backwaters of the Empire, in a colourful cavalcade of
wagons, its folk dressed in the colourful finery of travelling
players, bringing sonnet and song to excitable villagers and
peasants.
Upon reaching a new settlement, these outlandish showmen
erect their stage and entertain the poor rural folk with songs
and plays of the dark days of the Empire. Tales such as: ‘The
Emperor’s True Face’, ‘Orfeo and Pustulate’, ‘Papa Noigul’s
Festering Children’ and ‘A Midsummer Nightmare’ wow the
enraptured throng.
Strongmen perform feats of incredible prowess to the
adoration of the crowd, whilst players in garish, grinning
masks juggle balls, knives and flaming brands. As the
crowd’s numbers increase, a fool in bright jester’s garb with
an inflated pig’s bladder on a stick leaps from one enthralled
watcher to the next joking and cackling, poking and
prodding.
It is only when the show reaches its blasphemous climax, as
the sun begins to set, that the truth of the Carnival of Chaos is
revealed in all its putrid, festering glory. For these are no
mere wandering thespians and entertainers. When the players
perform their final act, known as the ‘Dance of Death’, the
enchantments covering their true visages slowly slip away
revealing them to their blissfully ignorant audience for they
are cavorting, cyclopean daemons with rotting flesh hanging
from yellowing bones. What were originally considered
intricately decorated masks and cleverly applied make-up is
soon revealed as the players’ true horribly mutated faces,
covered in pustules and pox-ridden lesions. As the villagers’
expressions turn from those of elation to abject terror at the
sight of these horrific visions the slaughter begins. By now
most of the folk who made up the cheering audience would
have already succumbed to the virulent diseases spread by
these malevolent players. The insidious Carnival Master,
accompanied by his cackling fool, rounds up those
unfortunate women and children that remain alive, taking a
finger from each of his new brides, exclaiming “You’re my
wife now!”. The survivors are then led away to an unknown
fate and the village is left deserted, its inhabitants and
livestock killed by innumerable diseases and plague.
The Carnival of Chaos is the sick joke of the Great Lord of
Decay, the Chaos god known as Nurgle. Thrice cursed
Nurgle is also known as the unspeakable Master of Plague

and Pestilence and the players in the Carnival are his corrupt
followers and worshippers. They are those who have sold
their souls for a twisted form of immortality through
embracing death, destruction and decay – learning to love
Nurgle’s many and varied gifts. It is not known how many
Carnivals of Chaos there are or if the handful of reports from
the lips of petrified witnesses all refer to the same warband.
The leader of the Carnival of Chaos is known as the Carnival
Master and is reputed to be a sorcerer of great power,
wielding the unclean magic of his lord to cause suffering and
death through disease and decay. Through dark ritual and
sacrifice, the Carnival Master summons forth the cackling,
decaying Daemons of his patron god to take part in the
twisted masquerade. His mortal followers carefully nurture
their newly acquired diseases, blessings of their gregarious
deity and vie for power and advancement under his watchful
gaze. The most blessed of these twisted, insane creatures are
those known as the Tainted Ones. These are often the right-
hand ‘men’ of the Carnival Master and their bodies are
wracked with a multitude of foul diseases and mutation. The
Carnival of Chaos is justly hunted by the many bands of
zealous Witch Hunters that traverse the lands but always
seems to be just one step ahead of the Sigmarites and
continues to follow its merry path, bringing the blessings of
Nurgle to all.

Carnival Master starts with one spells generated at random
from the Nurgle Rituals. See the Magic section for details. In
addition the Magister may learn a new Spell instead on a new
skill.

0-2 Brutes
60 Gold Crowns to hire
These are a very specific type of mutant that have had their
constitution bolstered by the unnatural vitality of the Lord of Decay.
Nurgle’s foul attention has transformed what were once men into
massive, statuesque creatures rippling with diseased muscles and a
supernatural vigour. Brutes are immensely strong individuals and
their part in the masquerade that is the Carnival of Chaos is as
strongmen performing feats of strength to entertain the crowds.
They are nearly always hooded in the nature of executioners for
although their bodies appear outwardly strong and healthy, their
faces are often riddled with disease and are half-decayed. In battle,
they wield huge hammers and flails with reckless abandon, whirling
them around their heads like children’s toys.

0-2 Tainted Ones
25 Gold Crowns to hire (+Cost of Blessings of Nurgle)
The Tainted Ones are those that are most blessed and favoured of
Father Nurgle. They hold a position of great importance within the
hierarchy of the Carnival. They are often heavily robed and
protected by powerful enchantments, for beneath their robes are
unspeakable horrors. The bodies of the Tainted Ones are so
wracked with disease and mutation that it is unsafe for even the
other mortal members of the warband to touch their bare skin.
Ironically, they take the most prestigious role in the Carnival – the
fool. The Tainted Ones leap and prance about the audience, dressed
as jesters, when the Carnival is performing, laughing and joking
with the gathered throng infecting them with their multitude of
horrendous maladies. These twisted creatures are exceptionally
dangerous opponents in combat too, for it is said that they carry the
dreaded and incurable Nurgle’s Rot.

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
0–2 Plague Bearers
50 Gold Crowns to hire
Plague Bearers are daemons of the Chaos god Nurgle, also known
as the Lord of Decay. They can be identified by their cyclopean
faces and horrifically decayed bodies. Their entrails hang from
tattered holes in their grey-green, poxridden flesh and the aura of
death and decay surrounds them. They are sometimes known as the
Tallymen of Plagues or Maggotkin and are highly revered by the
mortal members of the warband. As with all Daemons they can
never be killed or destroyed for good so long as the power of their
god prevails. However, their presence in the mortal world is tenuous
and can only be maintained for long periods by Dark Magic and
sacrifice. In the Carnival, the Plague Bearers revel in their showy
roles as stage actors and players, dressing in filth encrusted but
ostentatious doublet and hose.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 4 3 4 4 1 4 2 10
Weapons/Armor: None. Plague Bearers have huge filth
encrusted claws, which they use to tear and slash at their foes.
They therefore neither need nor use weapons and cannot wear
armor.
Special Rules
Cloud of Flies: Plague Bearers are surrounded by a cloud of
flies, which buzz around them and their combat opponent.
They do not affect the Plague Bearer but distract foes by
buzzing into eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Plague Bearer’s
close combat opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all
attacks.

Stream of Corruption: Plague Bearers can spew forth a
grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This is
counted as a shooting attack with a range of 6" and is
resolved at Strength 3 with no saves for armor.
Demonic: Plague Bearers are Daemons of the lord of disease,
Nurgle, and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Plague Bearers are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Plague Bearers are Daemons and do
not know the concept of fear. They automatically pass any
Leadership-based test they are required to take.
Cause Fear: Plague Bearers are horrifying supernatural
creatures and therefore cause fear.
Daemonic Aura: Due to the magical, intangible nature of
Daemons they have a special Armor save of 5+. This is
modified by the Strength of the attack as normal and is
completely negated by magic weapons and spells. Plague
Bearers’ attacks are considered as magical also.
Daemonic Instability: Plague Bearers are bound to the
world by Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If
taken out of action a Plague Bearer is banished and
effectively destroyed on a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for
injury). In addition, if the warband routs then every Plague
Bearer in the warband must take an immediate Leadership
test. If this test is failed, then the Plague Bearer counts as
destroyed.


Nurglings
15 Gold Crowns to hire
Nurglings are tiny Daemons of Nurgle and are viewed by other
followers of the pus god as akin to his beloved children. They are
like rotten boils with legs and razor sharp teeth, that pick and tear
and infect their foes with filth-encrusted claws. Nurglings are
generally more of a nuisance in a fight than any real threat but in
sufficient numbers can overwhelm even the toughest of warriors.
Nurglings are mischievous little bundles of filth and pus and take
great delight in their part in the Carnival of Chaos, not only as
musicians but also as fools and slapstick comedians. Nurglings
often befriend the children of each village they visit, only revealing
their foul identity to their terrified victims at the final stage of
‘Nurgle’s Great Play’.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

not affect the Nurglings but distract foes by buzzing into
eyes, nostrils and mouths. A Nurgling’s close combat
opponent suffers a -1 to hit modifier on all attacks.
Swarm: You may summon as many Nurglings as you wish
(i.e.. you may have more than five Nurglings in a Henchman
group).
Daemonic: Nurglings are Daemons of the diseased Lord
Nurgle and are not made of living flesh but the eternal and
unchanging forces of Chaos. Therefore they never gain
Experience.
Immune to Poison: Nurglings are the Daemonic
embodiment of disease and pestilence. They are totally
immune to all poisons and diseases.
Immune to Psychology: Nurglings are Daemons and do not

attacks are also considered as magical.
Daemonic Instability: Nurglings are bound to the world by
Dark Sorcery that is highly volatile and unstable. If taken out

a D6 roll of 1-3 (do not roll for injury). In addition, if the
warband routs then every Nurgling in the warband must take
an immediate Leadership test. If this test is failed, then
Nurgling counts as destroyed.

Brethren
25 Gold Crowns to hire
Brethren are the crazed and devoted followers of Nurgle the Lord of
Decay. They have totally embraced the philosophy of the great Lord
of Decay and the path of damnation is the road that they have
chosen. Most brethren are infected with foul diseases and some have
even started to decay. Their faces are covered in warts and boils
and other lesser gifts of their lord. In the Carnival, the Brethren take
on all of the minor roles: stagehands, puppeteers, etc.

0–1 Plague Cart
120 Gold Crowns to hire
The Plague Cart is the embodiment of Nurgle and the core of the
Carnival of Chaos. Bedecked in the colourful, garish finery of the
coaches of travelling players and thespians, the Cart easily draws
the eyes of the dull and bland peasantry of the villages. However,
the canvas is tattered and rotten, the frame splintered and bent, the
metalwork pitted and rusted and the steeds rotted and dank. Few
mortals have ever seen the interior of one of these most sinister of
vehicles for it is only the Carnival Master and his Daemonic
minions that are permitted entry. It is rumoured that these
ramshackle wagons contain a pentagram daubed with dark runes of
incredible potency that actually creates a portal to the realms of
Chaos and the dwelling place of great Nurgle himself.

Guardian - 3 - 3 3 - 3 1 -
Weapons/Armor: None. The Plague Cart’s Guardian does
not use or need weapons but suffers no penalties for fighting
unarmed. Therefore it cannot use weapons and cannot wear
armor.
Special Rules
Plague Cart: The Daemonic nature of the Plague Cart fills
both the Daemons and mortals of the Carnival of Chaos with
vigour. The maximum number of warriors allowed in the
warband is increased by +2.
In addition, the Daemonic Instability of the Daemons within
the warband is slightly offset. Plague Bearers and Nurglings
may re-roll Leadership tests for Instability and may +1 to
their Injury tests if taken out of action.
Guardian: The Guardian comes as part of the Plague Cart. In
fact, more often than not he is physically bonded to the cart in
some twisted nightmare of flesh and wood. He may therefore
never dismount from the cart or leave under any
circumstances. In addition, as he is part of the Cart he cannot
be injured unless the Cart is destroyed in which case so is he.
The Guardian is considered a Daemonic creature and so
never gains any Experience. Attacks from the Guardian cause
Nurgle’s Rot.
The Plague Cart and Guardian are considered Daemonic and
don’t know the concept of fear. The Plague Cart
automatically passes any Leadership-based test it is required
to take.


#### Beastmen Raiders

The Beastmen are brutish, wild and unnatural creatures that
live in the deep forests. Anyone travelling through this
untamed wilderness risks being attacked by these
unpredictable raiders. Many of those who dwell within the
forests around the outskirts of Mordheim claim that these vile
creatures of Chaos outnumber mankind, though such
statements are impossible to prove, for the Beastmen build no
cities and do not create any structured form of society as
such. Order and organisation are alien and hated by them, and
they roam where they will, pillaging and killing for whatever
they have need or want for. They willingly turn on each
other, picking on the weakest amongst them for food and fun.
The Beastmen naturally form into roaming warbands, though
whether they do so consciously or merely instinctively is
unknown. A small warband is able to move swiftly through
the wilderness unnoticed, and can cover hundreds of miles
each season as they travel where they will. They are led by
the strongest and most ferocious of their kind, and if ever one
within the warband senses a weakness in their leader, they
will turn on him in a brutish leadership challenge that can
only result in one of the two being killed and consumed by
the victor. Literally thousands of these small warbands infest
the dark forests of the Old World, preying upon travellers and
farmsteads.
A Beastmen warband attacks without warning, and villagers,
merchants and travellers live in constant fear of ambush from
these forest denizens. They try to prepare themselves for such
an event, and often desperately appeal to the nobles to scour
the forests with their State troops – however, at such a time of
political upheaval, the nobles have far more pressing
concerns than the pleas of low-born villagers. Forced to fend
for themselves, terrified villagers hack down great swathes of
the forest around their settlements, and sometimes hire the
services of mercenaries to protect them, barricading
themselves indoors when they hear rumours of a marauding
band within the area. Nevertheless, purges of the forest are
nearly always hopeless, for the Beastmen warbands generally
move far away from an area they have struck well before
organised retaliation can be mounted.
The more isolated farms and villages are most at risk
from attack, being far from any aid. Frequently, travellers
will discover buildings and farms burnt to the ground, cattle
butchered and lying where they were cut down. Full of
malevolence, Beastmen take particular delight in tearing
down the carefully constructed and ordered structures of men.
They smash down fences and rip buildings down to rubble,
allowing them to be reclaimed by the forests. They
maliciously soil and blight painstakingly planted crops, and
will tear the throats from newborn lambs merely for sport.
Beastmen warbands often form temporary encampments,
from which to raid the surrounding areas. These are crude
things, usually little more than a place to store any plundered
loot and food. They may include roughly staked out pens for
their massive war hounds or for holding captives – both are
taunted and starved for no other reason than it is in the
Beastmens nature to behave so. Typically, a warband will
remain at this encampment until it makes one sizeable raid,
whereupon the Beastman chief will move his camp to another
area. These encampments are often positioned nearby roads

and settlements, for such areas are ripe for plunder. The
Beastmen are a constant threat, and even if travellers are
lucky enough not to encounter them, their presence can
always be felt, watching and waiting in the twisted shadows
amongst the dark trees. None can predict their movements,
and many live in constant fear of their attacks.
Beastmen are brutish creatures, the Children of Chaos and
Old Night. They roam the great forests of the Old World, and
are amongst the most bitter enemies of Mankind. The raging
power of Chaos has given them a ferocious vitality which
makes them shrug off ghastly wounds and carry on fighting
regardless of the consequences. Even the Orcs are
comparatively vulnerable to damage compared to the
awesome vitality of the Beastmen.
Beastmen are a crossbreed between men and animals, usually
resulting in the horned head of a goat, though many other
variations are also known to exist. The Beastmen are divided
into to two distinct breeds: Ungors, who are more numerous,
twisted creatures that combine the worst qualities of man and
beast, and Bestigors, a giant breed of Beastmen, a mix
between some powerful animal and man.
The Ungor are smaller Beastmen, who cannot compete with
Bestigors in strength and power. They may have one horn or
many, but these won’t be recognised as those of goat.
Bray Shaman are very special Beastmen and are revered by
all Beastmen, for they are the prophets and servants of Chaos
Powers.
Each warband of Beastmen includes a mix of some Bestigor,
Gor warriors and Ungor who are the mainstay of the tribes.
Seven great Herdstones stand hidden in the forests
surrounding the city of Mordheim. From there the Beastmen
warbands come to raid the city: Warherd of Thulak,
Headtakers of Gorlord Zharak, the Horned Ones of Krazak
Gore, and many others.
The shards of the meteorite are seen as holy objects, which
can be sold to the powerful Beastlords and revered Shamans
in exchange for new weapons and services of warriors.
For the tribes of Beastmen the battles fought in Mordheim are
part of a great religious war, an effort to bring down the
civilisation of man which offends the Chaos gods. After the
taint of Man has been wiped from the face of the earth then
the Beastmen shall inherit.
Appearance: Beastmen Bestigor stand some six-seven feet
tall, and their heavily muscled bodies are covered with fur.
Ungor are lesser Beastmen, no larger than Humans, but their
tough bodies and vicious tempers easily make them a match
to any Human warrior.
Beastmen wear little clothing, but often dress in the fur of
their defeated rivals. They usually carry the skulls of their
vanquished enemies as these are thought to bring good luck.
While most Beastmen have dark brown skin and fur, black-
furred or even albino Beastmen are not unknown.
Beastmen wear heavy armlets and necklaces which serve as
armor as well as decoration.
Apart from the most primitive clubs and wooden shields, the
Beastmen make few weapons. It is not the nature of Chaos to
create, but to destroy.


##### Special Rules

Infighting: Beastmen are constantly sparring with each
other, even in the middle of the battle. If at the start of your
movement phase any Gor or Ungor does not see any enemy,
make a leaderhip test on 3D6 (roll three dices and choose the
two lowest rolls). If the Gor or Ungor fails the test, he moves
full allowed distance directly to the nearest fellow Gor or
Ungor who is not in hand-to-hand combat (if there is any). If
he reaches the member, both may do nothing this turn.
Heroes are unaffected by infighting.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Chaotic

##### Choice of Warriors

A Beastmen warband must include a minimum of three

#### Shadow Warrior Warbands

Nagarythe was once one of the most prosperous and beautiful
of the kingdoms of the High Elven land of Ulthuan. When the
Witch King Malekith and his mother Morathi led the
kingdom of Nagarythe astray into worship of the Chaos
Gods, not all of their people followed. When Malekith led his
people in a rebellion against the rightful Phoenix King, those
who had not been converted to depravity remained loyal to
the throne of Ulthuan and waged a secret war, a war of
shadows, against the Witch King and his armies. When the
Witch King was defeated and forced to flee with his
followers, most of these ‘shadow warriors’ were killed,
drowned by the sea as their land was torn asunder by the
Witch King’s foul magics.
The people of Nagarythe that survived became a nation of
wanderers, moving from place to place and never really
welcomed by other High Elves, for these Shadow Elves as
they became known had gained a reputation for being a fierce
and warlike people, full of cruelty. This reputation, while
probably only partially true, sets the Shadow Elves apart
from other members of their race. This, along with their grim
attitude and generally dark presence, makes other High Elves
feel ill at ease around them. In Ulthuan they are misfits and
outcasts, and many of these proud people seek their fortunes
outside Ulthuan entirely. They truly are a race ‘in the
shadows’ between the cruel darkness of the Dark Elves, and
the beautiful light of the other High Elves.
Some of the Elves of Nagarythe have been driven mad by this
condition, but most have accepted their existence, and are
driven on by a desire for revenge against the arch nemesis the
Witch King and his perverse mother. The Shadow Elves form
themselves into warbands and travel the lands of Ulthuan and
the Known World, sometimes fighting Dark Elves (and other
forces of Chaos) when they find them, and fighting just to
survive the remainder of the time. Some still work in the
service of the Phoenix king, acting as scouts and trackers for
his armies. Sometimes small units of these warriors will be
sent by their king to distant lands on a special mission for
Ulthuan – recovery of ancient artefacts left behind when the
High Elves abandoned the Old World, or sabotage of a
rumoured plot of the Dark Elves. When sent on such a
mission, these bands bring their military trappings with them

- standards and war horns, unit insignia fiercely emblazoned
on their shields – for the Shadow Elves take pride in their
loyalty to the Phoenix King. Other warbands represent small
groups of warriors seeking their fortune... though still loyal to
Ulthuan, they may no longer feel welcome in their island
home, or perhaps they represent a family pursuing a personal
vendetta against a particular Dark Elf leader. Whatever the
case, bands of Shadow Warriors may occasionally be seen
roving the lands of the Old World to exploring the steamy
jungles of Lustria.
Due to their wandering nature, it’s not uncommon to see
Shadow Warriors travelling the lands of the Empire, so they
should fit right in your normal games of Mordheim.
However, the Empire is not the only land these tireless

warriors travel to in their quest to rid the world of Dark
Elves. As more settings are introduced for the game, you will
be able to take your Shadow Warriors to other lands, such as
the jungles of Lustria as introduced in Lustria Cities of Gold.
You should not feel constrained to keep the Shadow Warriors
in one city, it is their nature to wander.
##### Special Rules

Hate Dark Elves: All warriors in a Shadow Warrior
Warband (excluding any Hired Swords) have an unyielding
Hatred for Dark Elves.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Shadow Warrior Warband can
spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors
(i.e. twice their Initiative in inches).
Distaste for Poison: The use of poisons and various drugs is
a Dark Elf specialty. As such, it is frowned upon by Shadow
Warriors, even more so than by other High Elves. Warriors in
a Shadow Warrior Warband may not use poisons of any type.
Unforgiving: In addition to their hatred of their corrupt kin,
the folk of Nagarythe have a long history of struggle against
the forces of Chaos. In multiplayer games, a Shadow Warrior
warband may never forge an alliance with any Warband of a
Chaotic nature (Possessed, Skaven, Beastmen, Dark Elves,
etc.).
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Elves of Nagarythe have learned to stifle their distaste for
‘lesser races’, and have even been known to work alongside
them from time to time. A Shadow Warrior Warband may
hire any Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so
no Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins).
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Shadow Warrior Warband must include a minimum of 3
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns which you can use to
recruit your initial warband. Maximum number of warriors in

##### Heroes

1 Shadow Master
70 Gold Crowns to hire
Shadow Master is a very honourable title among the warriors of the
Shadow Elves... it is given to one who has fought in the shadow war
for so long that he rules the darkness that he fights from. Often a
member of the former Nagarythe nobility, the captain of a Shadow
Warrior Warband is known by the honourable title ‘Shadow
Master’. These proud and strong-willed warriors often gather a
small band of their followers and seek a life away from the hesitant
charity and distasteful stares of Ulthuan.

0-3 Shadow Walker
45 Gold Crowns to hire
One step down from the title of Shadow Master is Shadow Walker. A
walker in the shadows is considered to have made friends with the
darkness, and while he does not command it, it gives him aid when
asked. Shadow Walkers are seasoned veterans in the war against
the Dark Elves. They are skilled trackers and hunters, and the most
trusted lieutenants of the Warband’s captain, the Shadow Master.

0-1 Shadow Weaver
55 Gold Crowns to hire
All High Elves have some aptitude for magic, and those with the
greatest aptitude are taught how to bend the Winds of Magic to their
will. Shadow Weavers are the mages of Nagarythe. Due to the
nature of their unending war against the Dark Elves, the mages of
Nagarythe tend to specialise in magics that use shadows to conceal
their presence and confound their enemies. In fact the title Shadow
Weaver comes from the nature of their magic... like a talented
tailor, the Shadow Weaver takes the threads of shadow and fashions
them into shapes and forms of his choosing.

#### Forest-Walker Warbands

Once elves were a common sight in the Old World. After the War of The Beard they decided to leave the Old World and travel
back to Ulthuan but some elves stayed back and settled in the big forests of Bretonnia. Most famous is the wood elf kingdom
of Athel Loren ruled by Orion and Ariel. But the wood elves do not only live in Athel Loren and there are small communities
in most of the large forests of the Empire. On the rare occasions that the Wood Elves willingly enter into discourse with other
races while in search of extremely rare herbs or to check the integrity of magical seals designed to keep intruders from finding
secrets best kept from the prying eyes of the lesser races. But, ever since the appearance event known among men as the
Hammer of Sigmar, (the twin-tailed comet) there have been an increasing number of disturbing rumours that there is a group of
Shadow Dryads in the blasphemous city of Mordheim. Are they the work of Cyanathair, do they belong to the fallen kin of
Coethil or is there a more sinister truth behind these rumours?

##### Forest of Athel Loren

The forest of Athel Loren is typically isolationists, they are
ruled by the demi-gods Orion and Ariel, the King and Queen
of the Woods. Ariel has great sorcerous power and wisdom
beyond mortal ken. With the falling of the comet known
among men as the Hammer of Sigmar, she felt the approach
of a great and evil power; a fallen Chaos lord cast out of the
dark Realms by the other Gods whom it had tried and failed
to destroy. Known to man as Malal, this evil power was now
incarnate on the physical plane and not subject to the
instability that keeps other powers of Chaos somewhat in
check. Ariel saw in her wisdom that the coming of the Lord
of Shadows to the Old World would be a harbinger of dark
times and the beginning of a blight upon the land. It was clear
to her that Malal must be destroyed early or he would grow in
power and spread his poison across the lands. By the time the
Shadowlord turned his eye to Athel Loren he would be too
powerful to stop. Therefore a call went out and the bravest
Wood Elves of the glades of Athel Loren volunteered to
make the dangerous journey across the lands of the men of
the Empire and search out the evil that is Malal and destroy
it.
Special rules
Recruitment: Wood Elves are fewer in number than most of
the other groups staking their claims in Mordheim. To
represent this, it is harder for them to recruit replacements
than other warbands. When a Wood Elven warband wishes to
employ new members, the gold coin cost is paid for all
reinforcements is paid, but the warriors don’t show up
immediately; the new recruits must make the journey from
Athel Loren to Mordheim. Therefore the entire group of
reinforcements will arrive after 1d3 games have passed.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from forest of
Athel Loren receive a bonus of +2 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.

##### Forest of Shadows

Before the twin-tailed comet devastated Mordheim the Forest
of Shadows was the home of a magnificent elven settlement
but with the fall of Mordheim horrible beasts and horrors
began to pour out of the city and infiltrate the forest
corrupting the sacred glades. The rumor of the magical
abilities of the Starstone (or wyrdstone as men named it)
spread and the wood elf mages believed that with this power
they could once more restore the balance of the forest and
save the sacred glades that had been corrupted. Thus it was
decided by the elders to send small bands of warriors to
Mordheim to retrieve shards of Starstone.
Special rules
Beast-Hunters: All the Forest-Walker warbands from the
Forest of Shadows Hate Beastmen.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Forest of
Shadows receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.
##### The Great Forest

It is Said that hidden deep inside the Great Forest of the
Empire, high amount the trees you might find the hidden
village of Wood Elves, they have been hiding ever sines the
War of The Beard. It is also said that some are from an
ancient city which was destroyed by the Dwarves. From the
ruins of this city, the now City of Mordheim stands. It is not
known why, but the Wood Elves of the Great Forest are on
the move. Maybe there is an ancient treasure hidden in the
old Elven Ruins or maybe something even Darker hidden
away down there!
Special rules
Waywatchers: Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest may have an addition Waywatcher, but would lose the
Wardancer.
Rare items: The Forest-Walker warbands from the Great
Forest receive a bonus of +1 when finding rare items.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful, Lawful / Neutral, Neutral.


##### Wood Elves Special Rules

Dark Enemies: Forest-Walker warbands may never ally with
Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (see the ‘Multiplayer
Rules for more details on warband alliances). If ally with any
Dwarven warbands (not Hired swords) then both parties will
count as having distrusted alliance even if both Parties have
the same alliance type.
Excellent Sight: Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere
humans. All the Elves in a Forest-Walker Warband can spot
Hidden enemies from twice as far away as other warriors (i.e.
twice their Initiative in inches).
Forest Folks: The Wood Elves spend their entire lives in the
confines of their forest, to represent this all Wood Elves have
the following:
* Wood Elves gain a +1 to Leadership bonus, while in
woodland terrain. (This bonus will not take the
Leadership characteristic above 10)
* Wood Elves can move through woodland terrain without
penalty
* Wood Elves that deploy behind a tree or shrub (or similar
cover) may declare to be hidden from the start of the
battle.
Tolerant: Due to their outsider status with their own people,
the Wood Elves have learned to stifle their distaste for ‘lesser
races’, and have even been known to work alongside them
from time to time. A Forest-Walker Warband may hire any
Hired Sword that is not of a Chaotic or evil bent (so no
Skaven, Possessed, Beastmen, Dark Elves, Undead, etc.).
They also shun the company of anyone specialising in the use
of poison (so no Assassins) or Black power weapons. Also
Forest-Walker Warband will not hire any Dwarven Hired
Swords.
Wood Elf Archery: When using normal Longbows, an extra
6" range and an additional -1 Armor save. Therefore a
standard Longbow has a 36" range and-1 armor saves vs.
normal armor.
Forest Spirits: The following rules apply to all creatures
with the Forest Spirit special rule:
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Psychology.
* All Forest Spirits are Immune to Poison.
* All Forest Spirits Cause Fear.
* All Forest Spirits do not gain experience.
* All Forest Spirits treat all stunned as knock down.
* All Forest Spirits have a special save against all attacks,
(3+ for a Great Oak, 4+ for a Tree-kin, & 5+ for Dryads).
* All Forest Spirits are Flammable and will take an addition
S5 hit if they are hit with a flammable weapon.

#### Witch Hunters

The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as
the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the
eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers,
fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods,
deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of
profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting
music. Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the
suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception
of other Witch Hunters.
It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its
forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death
by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy.
Many of the Witch Hunters’ victims treacherously avoid their
fate by perishing under torture before making a full
confession. In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are
kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The
most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the
Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon
worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the
name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they
are the most abhorrent!
The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters
with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of
events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar’s
punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters
rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has
been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s
holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of
the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded the
Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the
wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also pits them
into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters
of Sigmar – those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-
heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty
of Sigmar.
Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon
turn a crowd to their own ends. They are universally dreaded,
for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are
countless individuals who would willingly and
enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a

Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch
Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens,
Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the
huge vicious war hounds which the Witch Hunters employ to
track and bring down fugitives.
As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-
armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and
headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly
curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them
of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so
that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.
The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that
accompany them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight
indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or
surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their
reason as well.

1 Witch Hunter Captain
60 gold crowns to hire
Driven by fanaticism, Witch Hunter Captains are obsessed with
cleansing Mordheim and bringing the justice of Sigmar to all.
Carrying the edict of the Grand Theogonist himself, they have the
divine right to judge and execute warlocks, witches, Chaos
worshippers... in fact all who dare to oppose them.

The Grand Theogonist himself has granted the Warrior-Priests an

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Zealots
20 gold crowns to hire
When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is
often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering
pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge
their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots.
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy
evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been
peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in
a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in
their ranks, and many a band of Zealots is led by Witch Hunters.

Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the
world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the
ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane
persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire,
preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing
speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to
fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread.
Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat, for
they have the strength of madmen, and their bodies have become
inured to pain because of self-mutilation.

world is nigh, and nothing in this world holds any terror for
them. Flagellants automatically pass all Leadership-based
tests they are required to take. A Flagellant may never
become a warband leader.


#### Sisters of Sigmar

For centuries the nobility of the Empire has sent its wayward
or troublesome daughters to the Holy Convent of the Order of
Merciful Sisters of Sigmar in Mordheim to be initiated into
the only order of priestesses dedicated to the Empire’s patron
god. The Sisters of Sigmar, as they are commonly called,
have traditionally travelled the Empire administering to the
sick and poor, tending to the needs of orphans, curing the
diseased and mending broken bodies. As well as the healing
arts, which they practise with expert knowledge of herb-lore
and prayer, their advice is frequently sought by those about to
make an important decision, for the Sisters of Sigmar are
famed for their ability to predict the fickle course of fate.
Though once much loved by the common people, the Sisters
have seen their popularity wane in recent years. Rabble-
rousing Witch Hunters have denounced them as witches and
heretics, so that even in the countryside they are attacked and
driven away by the very peasants they seek to help. Many of
Sigmar’s priests wish to disband the order altogether,
claiming that women have no right to teach the holy word of
Sigmar. Even the Grand Theogonist, ostensibly the chief
authority over the order, has cooled towards the sisterhood,
denying the throne to Magritta of Marienburg who was
brought up by the Sisters and said to be sympathetic to their
cause. These days the Sisters of Sigmar have retreated to their
convent situated high on the craggy island of Sigmar’s Rock
in the river Stir in Mordheim.
Of all the inhabitants of Mordheim only the Sisters of Sigmar
were prepared for its destruction. Seeress Cassandora foretold
of the disaster and at their nightly vigil the Maidens of
Sigmar heard the voice of Sigmar speaking in their dreaming
minds. Thus they knew that they would be safe in their
fortress high above the city, raised as it is above the polluted
vapours, if only they were prepared to survive the fire of
Sigmar’s Fury.
While the rest of Mordheim fell under a spell of madness the
Sisters of Sigmar offered prayer after prayer, scourging
themselves to drive out all thoughts of sin, fervently
accepting a punishing penitential regime to harden their
minds against the wantonness running rampant outside their
walls. When the blow finally came the Sisters gathered
beneath the great temple dome of their convent which, well

built and fortified as it was by the prayers of the Sisters,
protected them from the fire and heat of their master’s ire.
The Sisters believe they have a holy mission, a task that they
have been set by Sigmar himself and to which they must
submit themselves body and soul. Their sacred duty is to
gather up the shards of wyrdstone and hide it deep beneath
Sigmar’s Rock in the vaults of their convent where, shielded
by a great depth of solid granite and guarded by the eternal
prayers of the sisterhood, it will cause no harm to Sigmar’s
people. It is a nigh hopeless task, for there are few Sisters and
countless shards of stone. Worse still, there are many who
want the stone for themselves, to take it from Mordheim and
spread its contagion amongst the cities of the Empire.
The warbands of the sisterhood are led by tough Matriarchs,
each accompanied by a body of warrior sisters. The training
and harsh discipline of the convent includes mastery of
martial as well as ecclesiastic skills, for mastery of the body
is but the first step towards the mastery of the soul. Their
favoured weapon is the warhammer, the instrument of
Sigmar, seen as his holy symbol, alongside the twin-tailed
comet.

#### Bretonnia Crusades

By Sir Tomaso De Merrigan
This is a time when the Empire is being torn apart from
within. A time when there is no Emperor and the lands are
increasingly divided, as individual cities look to their own
lords and mercantile Burgomeisters gain in power through
gold. Where corruption flows like effluent down the River
Reik and conspiracy is rife throughout the land. By contrast,
happy is the land of Bretonnia where chivalry reigns, honour
is upheld and the Lady of the Lake still bestows her favour on
those deemed worthy. To the knights of Bretonnia Mordheim
is a vile place where virtue and order have been discarded.
Where a proud city once stood nightmarish creatures now
wander the streets and mix with men in dens of corruption
and squalor. It is therefore considered extremely virtuous for
a knight to embark on a spiritual quest to Mordheim, seeking
to achieve honour in battle and perhaps earn the favour of the
Lady of the Lake herself. In Mordheim a knight’s courage
and valour will be thoroughly tested, but so much the better,
because with hardship come honour.
A Questing Knight will relinquish his castle and domain to
set out on such a journey. He becomes free from any
obligation to defend a domain and will now seek a road
leading to new adventures. A Questing Knight has put all
worldly ambitions aside and is accorded a rank far greater
then even the most powerful dukes of the land. Such a
gesture is considered particularly noble, and it is not
uncommon for other knights and common folk to flock to the
Questing Knights aid. Knights Errant in particular are eager
for adventure and a chance to win honour by a feat of arms,
so will often join a Questing Knight on his journey. By the
time the Questing Knight leaves the fair lands of Bretonnia
he will have a sizable retinue following him, ready to fight
for the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake.
Once on a quest a Knight will be spurred on by dreams and
visions often visited upon him by the Lady of the Lake. This
leads him ever onwards and inspires and encourages him on
his quest. In time he hopes that through his deeds and valour
he will earn the favour of the Lady of the Lake and she will
let him drink from the Grail of Life. This is the final reward
for a knight, and on finding the Grail he will return to
Bretonnia to protect its people. Until that time though, he is
bound to fight the enemies of virtue and order and to endure
incalculable hardships.

##### Special Rules

Before heading into battle Bretonnian Knights kneel and pray
to the Lady of the Lake, avowing to fight to the death for
honour and justice. Before playing a game of Mordheim
make a Leadership test against the Leadership characteristic
of the warbands leader. If the test is successful the Lady of
the Lake has bestowed her blessing on the warband. The
blessing takes the form of a powerful curse upon the enemies
of chivalry, and in particular upon those that make use of the
foul and dishonourable weapons of mass destruction. Any
model in the opposing warband who wishes to fire a black
powder weapon must roll a D6 and score 4+ to overcome the
curse, otherwise they may not fire the weapon. The opposing
player must test each time they wish to fire such a weapon.
Models armed with other shooting weapons, such as bows
and crossbows, do not have to test unless they dare raise their
weapons against the gallant Knights of Bretonnia. If any
enemy model wishes to shoot at a Bretonnian Knight
(Questing Knights and Errants only), then they must first roll
a 4+ on a D6 to overcome the curse.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Lawful.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Questing Knight’s warband must include a minimum of
three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your
initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the
warband may never exceed 12.
Questing Knight: Each Questing Knight’s warband must
have one Questing Knight: no more, no less!

Errant.

Knights.

#### Kislevite Warband

The land of Kislev lies to the north and east of the Empire.
The further east one travels the dense forests give way to
open steppes stretching to the foothills of the Worlds Edge
Mountains. The winters of Kislev are harsh and cruelly long
and for months the land is gripped by snow blizzards and ice.
The townships of Kislev are mainly built of timber for stone
is rare and only the most important of the cities have stone
buildings and walls. In the ancient capital city of Kislev the
massive white buildings are topped by vast gilded domes and
decorated with golden statues and gargoyles. It has been said
that Kislev is a poor country filled with rich people. It is
certainly true that the people that live in this beleaguered land
have an outlook on life that strangers often find surprisingly
positive. For Kislev is a country under constant threat of
invasion. Armies of savage Norse often venture into Kislev,
raiding and pillaging, and to make matters worse Kislev lies
right on the border of the Chaos Wastes, so that any Chaos
incursion passes through the land (and its people) first.
To aid them in their struggle against these murderous foes,
the Tzars of Kislev have forged strong ties with the Empire.
This alliance benefits both countries, as the rulers of the
Empire have long understood the benefit of a northern
bulwark against the tides of Chaos. Both countries have a
tradition of sending troops to aid the other in times of need,
and in fact the Gryphon Legion, pride of the Kislevite
nobility, was formed as a symbol of the unity between the
two countries. This knightly order is made up entirely of
Kislevite nobles, but is garrisoned and trained in the Empire.
Despite the constant threat of invading armies, the people of
Kislev sing and dance and play as much as or perhaps more
than the people of any other country in the Old World. Some
say that their relative happiness derives from their love of
strong drink. Whether this is true or not, Kislevites certainly
do enjoy their spirits, and in fact many of their people
attribute almost magical qualities to that most famous of
Kislevite drinks – vodka.
A Kislevite warband represents a group of individuals from
this unique northern realm. Kislevites tend to be quiet in the
face of strangers, but they hold much joy in their hearts. In
fact they are loud and boisterous when amongst their own
people. Kislevites are known to be extremely brave warriors,
and they hold a loathing for Chaos that is much stronger than
most of the peoples of the Old World. While many citizens of

the Empire may remain ignorant to the initial signs of a
Chaos cult, Kislevite citizens will immediately seek out any
signs of depravity and cleanse the infected individuals with
sword and flame. Keep these things in mind when you play a
Kislev warband. Most citizens of Kislev have lost homes or
loved ones to the warriors of Chaos, and they realise that
anything less than constant vigilance could lead to their
downfall. They are therefore unrelenting in their resolve
against their ancient enemies. Give the forces of Chaos no
quarter, and expect none in return.

1 Druzhina Captain
80 gold crowns to hire
Druzhina are the minor nobles of Kislev. During times of war these
nobles form their own regiments in a Kislevite army, and they look
most impressive with their ancient armor and weapons, as most of
these prized artefacts are handed down from father to son. Druzhina
are rich enough to afford their own horse and battlegear, and they
must be ready to fight for the Tzar when called upon. In return for
this they are allowed to own land and are given a break on their
annual taxes.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 4 4 3 3 1 3 1 8
Weapons/Armor: A Druzhina Captain may be equipped
with weapons and armor chosen from the Kislevite Warrior
equipment list.
Skills: The Druzhina Captain may choose from Combat,
Shooting, Academic, Strength & Speed when he gains a new
skill.
Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6" of the Druzhina Captain may
use his Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.

Inheritance: When the Kislevite warband is first created, the
Druzhina Captain is allowed to purchase one item from the
Kislevite Warrior equipment list at half the normal cost. This
item represents a treasured family heirloom that has been
passed down through the generations. Losing an ancestral
item is considered very disrespectful and if the item is ever
lost (e.g. from a Robbed result on the Serious Injury chart),
the Captain MUST replace it with a finely-made substitute as
quickly as possible or risk being haunted by the angry spirits
of his ancestors. To replace an ancestral item, the Captain
must purchase the same item of equipment at 150% of its
normal price. This higher cost represents the fine detail and
valuable materials used in the item’s manufacture. Until the
item is replaced, the Captain suffers a -1 penalty to all tests
and rolls to hit.
 
0-1 Esaul
35 gold crowns to hire
Esaul is an ancient Cossack term that means ‘Best Warrior’, and
was traditionally given to the most powerful fighter in the tribe. The
word has survived the generations, and today it is an honorary title
given by a chieftain to his personal champion, though it is also used
by Gospodar warriors as a more familiar term for an experienced
veteran. Most Kislevite cities contain at least one grizzled veteran
amongst the ranks of their professional soldiery who has been
affectionately labelled ‘Esaul’ by his men.

Weapons/Armor: An Esaul may be equipped with
weapons chosen from the Kislevite Warrior Equipment list.
Skills: The Esaul may choose from Combat, Shooting, &
Speed when he gains a new skill.


0-1 Bear Tamer
35 gold crowns to hire
Since ancient times, bears have featured in Kislevite myths and
legends. Kislevites have a deep respect for these mighty beasts, and
gather to see the trained specimens that accompany travelling
circuses. The powerful men that train these bears are known simply
as Bear Tamers, and the best of them are widely renowned amongst
the people of Kislev. Bears can be trained for martial purposes as
well, and Bear Tamers are often recruited into the armies of Kislev,
where they enjoy a special status among the soldiery.

Weapons/Armor: A Bear Tamer may be armed with

Skills: The Bear Tamer may choose from Combat, Strength

Special Rules
Bear Handler: A Kislevite Warband that includes a Bear
Tamer is allowed to purchase a Bear as a henchman. This
bear has been trained to follow the Tamer’s commands, and
so will automatically pass its Stupidity tests when within 6"
of the Bear Tamer (even if the Tamer has been Knocked
Down or Stunned).

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Warriors
25 gold crowns to hire
The Gospodar tribe make up the bulk of the people of Kislev, and
they are generally considered the most civilised of the peoples of
this harsh realm. Gospodars are people of large stature with blonde
or red hair. Their women are well known throughout the Old World
for their fair-skinned beauty. Gospodar women have the same rights
as men, and are allowed to rise to positions of power; in fact the
most powerful of the legendary Ice Mages of Kislev are all female!

Weapons/Armor: Warriors may be equipped with weapons
and armor chosen from the Kislevite Warrior equipment list.

Cossacks
30 gold crowns to hire
Cossacks are nomadic tribesmen who live in the far north of Kislev.
They are always the first to encounter any Chaos invaders from the
north, and so have long fostered a bitter enmity with the servants of
Chaos. Cossacks are renowned for their riding skills, and their
favoured weapons are the scimitar (sword) and spear.

Weapons/Armor: Cossacks may be armed with weapons

Special Rules
Hate Chaos: Years of bitter struggle against the forces of
Chaos have left their mark on the Cossack people. Cossacks
are subject to Hatred against all forces of Chaos (e.g.
members of any warband the players would apply the
Ancient Enemies special rule to).

0-3 Streltsi
25 gold crowns to hire
Firearms were first introduced to Kislev by Prince Boydinov of
Erengrad. Though very popular among his people, the prince was
considered quite eccentric (it was he that invented the mad game
called Kislevite Roulette). Despite initial superstition as time past
handguns have been accepted as essential weapons of war. In his
legacy the prince had a large portion of his wealth set aside for the
establishment and upkeep of a regiment of handgunners. The
regiment continues to this day and its members are known as
Streltsi. Soldiers from other cities in Kislev, most notably the
capital, are sent here to train in the use of firearms with the Streltsi.
In addition to their knowledge of handguns Streltsi are also trained
to use a small halberd called the berdiche. In fact the berdiche and
handgun are the most widely recognised symbols of the Streltsi. In
combat Streltsi are able to use their berdiches as rests for their
handguns, increasing their accuracy and making for a deadly
weapon combination.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
4 3 3 3 3 1 3 1 7
Weapons/Armor: Streltsi may be armed with weapons and
armor chosen from the Streltsi equipment list. Note that
Streltsi are the only Kislevite Warriors trained in the use of
handguns.
Special Rules
Gun-Rest: A Streltsi warrior armed with both halberd and
handgun may use the halberd as a gun-rest. The warrior
receives a +1 on his ‘to hit’ roll with the handgun, as long as
he did not move that turn (this applies even if the warrior has
a skill that allows him to move and shoot with his handgun –
he must not move if he is to rest the gun).


0-1 Trained Bear
145 gold crowns to hire
Bear Tamers often bring one of their sacred bears with them when
they prepare to enter battle. These great beasts respect little, and it
takes years for a human to win their trust and obedience. The effort
to train one of these creatures is well worth it however, as one
cannot hope for a more loyal friend or useful ally when things turn
bad.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

6 3 0 5 5 2 2 2 6
Weapons/Armor: None, other than their claws and teeth!
Special Rules
Trained: A bear doesn’t care about the warband’s mission or
enmity for other warbands – it’s just following the orders of
its trainer. Sometimes it gets bored waiting for orders; for this
reason Trained Bears are subject to the rules for Stupidity. If
given ‘special attention’ by its trainer, it will mind a bit
better, so a bear is not required to take these Stupidity tests if
the warband’s Bear Tamer is within 6". In fact this is the only
member of the warband the bear will listen to; a Trained Bear
will never use the warband leader’s Leadership for any tests
it is required to take. It may use the Bear Tamer’s leadership
if within 6" of him however. Note that the warband cannot
control the bear without a Bear Tamer. The Trained Bear may
not be used in any game in which the warband's Bear Tamer
does not take part (and this means that if the warband does

not include a Bear Tamer at all, the warband must keep the
bear staked back at camp until they hire a new one!).
Fearsome: A charging bear is a very scary sight indeed! A
Trained Bear causes Fear.
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armor save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Fiercely Loyal: Such dedication is built into the relationship
between Bear Tamer and bear that if his trainer is injured, a
bear will often stand over the body to protect it, or even drag
the trainer’s body to safety. As long as his bear is not taken
Out of Action during a game, a Bear Tamer ignores the
following results on the Serious Injury table: ‘Sold to the
Pits’, ‘Robbed’, and ‘Captured’ (and ignore equivalent results
in settings such as Lustria that have their own special Serious
Injury table). If any of these results are rolled for the Bear
Tamer, treat the result as a ‘Full Recovery’ instead.
Animal: Trained Bears are animals and do not gain
experience.


#### Dwarf Treasure Hunters

Dwarfs are a grim and exceptionally proud people. They respect three things above all else: age, wealth and skill. It is no
surprise then that these grim warriors can be found in Mordheim searching for fame and fortune. Mark Havener gives full
rules for including Dwarf warbands in Mordheim.
Occasionally, a Dwarf noble will find himself in desperate
times. His family hold may have been overrun by Goblins or
Skaven, or he may have somehow disgraced himself and
been banished. Other Dwarfs know these warriors as the
Dispossessed. Dwarfs are a proud race and it is against a
Dwarf ’s nature to lose himself in despair. Instead, a noble
who finds himself in such dire straits will gather together a
group of his closest friends and kin and go treasure hunting,
hoping to accumulate a large enough hoard to establish his
own holding. At this time, the largest source of wealth in the
Known World is rumoured to be a city in the Empire. The
city is known as Mordheim...

##### Special Rules

All Dwarfs are subject to the following special rules:
Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Armor: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armor.
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for supremacy
in the Old World. A Dwarf warband may never include any
kind of Elven Hired Sword or Dramatis Personae.
Incomparable Miners: Dwarfs spend much of their lives
underground searching for precious minerals, and they are the
best in the world at this kind of work. In the city of
Mordheim they apply similar skills to the search for
wyrdstone. When checking for wyrdstone at the end of a
game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf
warband.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral

##### Choice of warriors

A Dwarf warband must include a minimum of 3 models. You
have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and equip
your warband. The maximum number of warriors in the
warband is 12.
Noble: Each Dwarf warband must have one Noble – no
more, no less!
Engineer: Your warband may include up to 1 Engineer.
Troll Slayers: Your warband may include up to 2 Troll
Slayers.
Dwarf Clansmen: Your warband may include any number
of Dwarf Clansmen.

bought as a Gromril weapon instead. This multiplies the cost
of the weapon by 3. For rules on Gromril weapons see the
Mordheim rulebook. Note that this price is only for a starting
warband, as it represents the Dwarfs outfitting themselves at
their own stronghold. Later purchases of Gromril weapons
are done using the price chart in the Mordheim rules.
**The price of a suit of Gromril armor is cheaper for a
starting warband to represent the relative ease with which
Dwarfs can find such items in their own stronghold. Later
purchases of Gromril armor must be done using the normal
price chart in the Mordheim rules.
##### Heroes

1 Dwarf Noble
85 gold crowns to hire
Dwarf Nobles are fortune seekers who have recruited a band of like-
minded Dwarfs and set off from their stronghold in search of riches.
A Dwarf Noble is well respected by the members of his warband.
Often he is a member of one of the noble families of the lost Dwarf
strongholds, dreaming of collecting enough treasure to restore the
former glory of the Dwarf Kingdoms.

Expert Weapon smith: A Dwarf Engineer is a master of
mechanical devices. By using stronger construction materials
and time-tested secrets of Dwarf engineering, a Dwarf
Engineer can increase the distance the warband’s missile
weapons can shoot. All Dwarf missile weapons in the
warband have their range increased by 3" for Pistols and 6"
for Crossbows and Handguns. Any range increases are only
maintained as long as the Dwarf Engineer remains with the
warband.


0-2 Dwarf Troll Slayers
50 gold crowns to hire
Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult obsessed with
seeking an honourable death in combat. Having committed some
unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in some way, a Dwarf will
forsake his home and wander off to die fighting the enemies of
Dwarf kind. Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals,
psychopathic and violent. There are however few better fighters in

hunters.

#### Dwarf Rangers

From the Nemesis Crown
‘Old’ Borin was respected and revered amongst his contemporaries as he had outlived the majority of them and grown the beard to prove it.
He was used to reverence. Yet there was more to it than simple age, even in Dwarf Society where that carried a great deal of respect. He was
also a member of the Order of Runesmiths, it’s rites and rituals secretive and powerful.
Now, as he struck the axe blade, forging another ancient rune into its surface, uttering the words of power that would enhance the potency of
the weapon, Borin knew that each new runic item produced by him and his peers was another step in repairing the mistakes of the past.
Staring at the finished axe, the Runesmith felt a surge of pride, but fought it back. Yes the weapon was complete and empowered, but it was
no better than any produced now. Not compared to the great weapons forged in the Old Times and wielded in the hands of the greatest
heroes of his people. Only by locating the fabled weapons of the past and studying their runes could his people usher in a new Golden Age.
He and his fellow Runesmiths would not repeat the mistakes of the past...the new items of power that would be produced would be powerful,
and without flaw.

##### Special Rules

Hard to Kill: Dwarfs are tough, resilient individuals who can
only be taken out of action on a roll of 6 instead of 5-6 when
rolling on the Injury chart. Treat a roll of 1-2 as knocked
down, 3-5 as stunned, and 6 as out of action.
Hard Head: Dwarfs ignore the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Armor: Dwarfs never suffer movement penalties for
wearing armor.

Mordheim they apply similar skills to the search for
wyrdstone. When checking for wyrdstone at the end of a
game, add +1 to the number of pieces found for a Dwarf
warband.
Don’t Trust ‘Em: While Ranger Warbands are free to ally
with other Dwarf warbands in multi-player games, their point
of view is so different that they do not trust them fully.
Members of a Dwarf Rangers warband are never considered
‘friendly models’ to other dwarfs and vice versa.
This means that members of one warband WILL stop
members of the other from running, they won’t keep each
other from taking All Alone tests, etc. They don’t count as
enemy models and may split any treasure found at the end of
the game as normal, but the two bands are not friends, make
no mistake!
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral

##### Choice of Warriors

A Dwarf Rangers warband must include a minimum of 3
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns with which you can use
to recruit and equip your warband. The maximum number of

##### Heroes

1 Runesmith
85 gold crowns to hire
Dwarf Runesmiths are champions of the old ways. ‘If it was good
enough for my ancestors, it’s good enough for me!’ is a popular
saying. Fresh out of their decades-long apprenticeships, these
Runesmiths are normally on a quest to prove this saying and so will
gather together a party of like-minded individuals to seek out lost
treasures of their ancestors to confirm this adherence to the
traditional ways. The quest for an item like the Nemesis Crown is a
dream come true for a young Runesmith (not to mention many of a
more advanced age!).

Special Rules
Leader: Any warrior within 6” of the Dwarf Runesmith may
use his leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership
tests.

Inscribe Runes: A Runesmith knows one minor rune (see
list at the end of this warband list), determined randomly
when the warband is first created. He may inscribe the rune
on an item carried by one of the warriors of his warband, and
(if successful, see below) the item will gain a bonus from the
rune for that game. When a Runesmith advances and rolls a
skill on the Hero Advance table, he may choose to learn a
new rune instead of learning a skill (exactly like a spell caster
advancing and learning a new spell).

that makes his master more efficient in his efforts. An
Apprentice Runesmith in the warband allows a Master
Runesmith to inscribe on two items before each game,
instead of only one.


0-2 Troll Slayer
50 gold crowns to hire
While it may seem that Troll Slayers shouldn’t fit in with the rest of
a Ranger warband, make no mistake – they are strict adherents to
tradition and the old ways! Indeed they usually find it easier to get
along with the more traditional minded Dwarfs than other dwarfs,
who Slayers feel lack determination and the insight to see what the
true problems are with their race. Besides, on a perilous quest such
as this, the opportunities to achieve a death of legendary fame and
fulfil the Slayer Oath are too great to ignore.

Weapons/Armor: Troll Slayers may be equipped with
weapons chosen from the Dwarf Warrior equipment list.
Slayers may never carry or use missile weapons or any form
of armor.
Skills: The Troll Slayer may choose from Combat &
Strength, when he gains a new skill. In addition, the Troll
Slayer may choose from the Dwarf Special Skill list or the

Special Rules
Deathwish: Troll Slayers seek an honourable death in
combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and
never need to test if fighting alone.
##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Dwarf Clansman
40 gold crowns to hire
There are many Dwarfs who see the ‘wisdom’ in reliance on the old
ways, and believe that they are the path to follow in order to
recapture past glory for the Dwarf people. Most of these Dwarf
warriors venerate Runesmiths and are honoured to be chosen as
part of an expedition including one.

0-5 Dwarf Ranger
40 gold crowns to hire
Dwarf Rangers are the hunters and trailblazers of Dwarf society.
Often seen as “a bit odd” by their people due to their inclination for
wide-open spaces, Rangers are the perfect candidates to participate
in a mission such as this.

Beardling
25 gold crowns to hire
Many of the proponents of the old ways are older members of Dwarf
community. However there are still youngsters who believe and they
often accompany a Runic warband to lend a hand as needed to the
respected oldsters. More spry than their fellows, they are often used
as scouts, roaming ahead with the Rangers to spy the land and
observe enemy activity.

0-5 Dwarf Longbeards
50 gold crowns to hire
Tested Dwarf veterans who’ve fought in hundreds of battle over
their long lives, Longbeards are typically more than willing to
support an expedition to prove what they’ve said all along – the old
ways are best!

Weapons/Armor: A Dwarf Longbeard may be equipped
with weapons and armor chosen from the Dwarf Warrior
equipment list.
Special Rules
Stubborn: Dwarf Longbeards have seen just about
everything in their long careers and they know it. They are
used to fighting by themselves against impossible odds and it
hasn’t killed them yet. On top of all this they are just
generally more set in their ways than other Dwarfs and
they’re not about to let a bunch of weedy goblins drive them
off! A Dwarf Longbeard may reroll any failed Leadership test
he is required to take. Remember that you can never reroll a
reroll, so the result of this second roll must always be
accepted.


##### Dwarf Runes

Runesmiths harness the magic of the Warhammer world by
inscribing magical runes on items, imbuing them with a
variety of wondrous abilities. When a Runesmith graduates
from his long apprenticeship he has knowledge of one or two
minor runes taught to him by his master. These runes are less
powerful than normal Dwarf runes, in that they can only
utilise magic for a short time. As the Runesmith practises and
studies on his own, he gains the knowledge required to
inscribe the more powerful permanent runes on to items.
Before each game, the Runesmith may attempt to inscribe the
rune on an item one of the warriors in his warband is
carrying. To do so he must roll 2D6. If he rolls a number
equal to or greater than the Difficulty Level of the rune, the
item gains the appropriate bonus FOR THAT GAME. If he
rolls a ‘2’ on the 2D6, he has fumbled the inscription,
fractured the blade of the weapon or shattered the breastplate
of the armor, etc. The item is destroyed and must be
removed from the warrior’s list of items, though it may be
replaced before the game if the warband has sufficient gold
crowns. Any other failure simply means the Runesmith failed
to inscribe the rune correctly and the warrior gains no bonus.
The leader of a Dwarf Rangers warband represents a younger
Runesmith that has recently left the tutelage of his master. He
knows one of the following minor runes:

D6 Result
1 Rune of Stone Difficulty 8.
+1 to Armor Save.
2 Rune of Sharpness Difficulty 6.
-1 Armor Save modifier to weapon.
3 Rune of Speed Difficulty 7.
Initiative doubled on weapon
4 Rune of Warding Difficulty 8.
Special 4+ save Vs. Spells affecting target (placed on
belt, armband, etc. Cost to replace: 1 GC).
5 Rune of Accuracy Difficulty 9.
+1 to hit on weapon.
6 Rune of Striding Difficulty 8.
+1 Movement (placed on boots, belt, etc. Cost to
replace: 1 GC).
The Jealousy of Runes: Bonuses from Runes are not
cumulative with magical bonuses from other items. In other
words, a warrior may not combine a Rune of Stone on his
shield and a Rune of Shield on his armor for a total bonus to
his Armor Save of +2. Similarly the warrior could not
combine the Rune of Stone on his shield with some suit of
magic elven armor (for example) that added +1 to the
warrior’s Armor Save.


#### Von Carstein Warband

Count Vlad von Carstein and his wife Isabella have ruled the
province of Sylvania for as long as anyone can remember –
peasants whisper of some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile
them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their court. Indeed,
Sylvania has the most dire reputation of all the provinces of
the Empire. Few men sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania
have ever returned from those dark Sylvanian forests, and then
rarely with their sanity intact.
In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a throne
of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the ruler of Sylvania.
He waits in shadows, having set himself apart from the politics
and bickering of the Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he,
and all the ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave. Here he patiently
waits, drinking the blood of maidens from gold goblets.
For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength and
mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day soon he will
march from the forests of Sylvania at the head of an army of
restless dead. The pieces of magic stone that lie scattered
among the ruins of Mordheim can give the Count the power to
challenge the nobles of the Empire and enslave the men of the
Old World.
Wyrdstone holds enough captured magical energy to unleash a
great spell of doom to rival that of Nagash the Black. If the
Count is successful, he will raise all the dead between the
Worlds Edge Mountains and the borders of Stirland, and go to
war against the divided rulers of the Empire. His plans laid
out, Vlad sends his thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his
bidding.
During dark, moonless nights, black coaches arrive at the
gates of Mordheim carrying coffins. Ghouls scuttle from their
hiding places to greet them, and corpses are stirred by a
command which the living cannot hear. Following the
commands of the Vampire, they hunt for shards of wyrdstone.
The night belongs to the Undead, and in Mordheim it is
always night.

##### Special Rules

Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Master (or
Mistresses) and their undead minions. The human members of
a Von Carstein warband are immune to fear caused by types of
undead in their own warband, ie: skeletons, wights, vampires,
etc. Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

Vampires lead the Undead in their search for the magical stones
that will give their master the power to conquer the Empire.
Although but pale shadows when compared to the dread Vampire
Lords, the immortal servants of Vlad are still some of the most
powerful creatures who fight in Mordheim. Most of them serve the
undying count of Sylvania, but some have found the city to their
liking, and have become independent.

0-1 Necromancer
35 gold crowns to hire
Necromancers are evil wizards, studying the corrupt art of
Necromancy. Many of them are acolytes and servants of Vlad von
Carstein, and follow the agents of their master to the city of the
Damned. Others are recruited from amongst wizards and warlocks
who have come under the suspicion of the various agents of Sigmar
and have fled to Mordheim to avoid persecution.

In addition the Necromancer may learn a new Spell instead
on a new skill.
 
0-3 Dregs
20 gold crowns to hire
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of the demise of
Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals, shunned
even by the other men and women who still live in the ruins and
catacombs of the city.
Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with
surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to
their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve
them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to buy
equipment, weapons and supplies from the settlements around
Mordheim which would often not welcome Necromancers or where
Vampires would fall under the suspicion of the Witch Hunters. They
can also do the bidding of their vampiric master during daylight,
when the Vampires must rest in their coffins.

150 gold crowns to hire
The Undead Troll is a construct created by a necromancer using
both Dark magic and arcane science. The Necromancer then applies
his knowledge of science and magic to bring this creature to a state
of semi-life. This is a long and drawn out process, which involves a
fair amount of maintenance, so the Necromancer may only maintain
one Undead Troll at a time.

Ghouls
40 gold crowns to hire
Ghouls are the descendants of evil and insane men who ate the flesh
of the dead. When the lean and hungry times of famine come upon
the Old World, the most depraved and destitute took to feasting on
corpses to survive.
Driven by their unspeakable craving for the meat of their fellow
men, these creatures have given up their human life and dwell near
graveyards, crypts and tombs, digging up the rotting corpses of the
recently buried and consuming the cold flesh with their bare teeth
and claws.
The destruction of Mordheim attracted many Ghoul clans from the
north, and now they have taken up permanent residence in the
crypts and cemeteries of the ruined city.

Dire Wolves are slavering Undead hounds, the animated remains of
the giant wolves of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Their chilling howls
can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors or most
ruthless Dwarf mercenaries. They prowl the streets of Mordheim

Wolf around their neck.

Wights are long dead heroes who are tied to the land of the living by
magic. In ages past, the men of the Old World buried their dead
beneath mounds of earth and stone, together with their battle gear
and worldly wealth. Although their bodies have decayed, Wights are
held together by evil magic so strong that it can last for many
centuries. They wear ancient armor of bronze and black iron,
corroded by time and dusty with the years. They carry iron weapons
inlaid with evil runes, an accursed parody of once powerful magical
blades. Some Vampires rule over entire regiments of Wights,

Skeleton Warriors
20 gold crowns to hire
The battlefields of the Old World are strewn with the graves of many
nameless warriors who have fallen in combat and been consigned to
a hasty resting place, or left upon the ground amidst the carnage.
Even in death there is no rest for the fallen warriors, for they can be
summoned back to the world of the living by black sorcery. All that
these once-dead fighters can recall of their mortal life are faint
memories of battles fought long ago. All that they feel is the
compulsion to fight and to obey their masters as they did when they
were alive. A mortal who dares fight against an army of Skeletons is
confronted by a ghastly apparition, for who could remain unafraid
when faced with the remains of long-dead warriors lurching
towards him?

#### Lahmian Warband

This warband was based on one created by the Khemri guys, [http://grafixgibs.tripod.com/Khemri/index.htm.](http://grafixgibs.tripod.com/Khemri/index.htm.)
Long ago, the nobles of Lahmia stole the secret of the elixir of eternal life from the Great Necromancer, Nagash, during the
war in which he was expelled from the land of Nehekhara. Over time, corrupted by the secret they had stolen, they became the
first true vampires and were themselves driven out. Banished from their ancestral home, the Lahmians became mistresses of
seduction and cunning, indulging their hedonistic appetites through manipulation of lesser wills. Of all the great vampire
bloodlines, the Lahmians above all have become most adept at exploiting that great weakness of humanity, the desire for love,
power and an escape from death. Their poor, deluded followers do their bidding by night and protect them by day. Their
interest in humanity (if interest is the right word to use of what are, after all, merely instruments and playthings) has made
them strong. Now, centuries after they were dispossessed, Nehekhara is once again a land of the dead, and the Lahmian
vampires have returned from the Northlands to reclaim their own. In the North, they have learned how to bend humans to their
will. In their ancestral home they have older, more faithful servants who, dormant through the centuries, have awaited their
return.

##### Special Rules

Blood Successor: Unlike the Vampire warband, Lahmia
warbands may not recruit a new vampire if the warband
contains a Blood Sister. Instead, if the Lahmia is slain then
the Blood Sister may transform into a Vampire during the
post-battle experience phase. Until that happens the surviving
human henchmen with highest leadership (or, in the case of a
tie, the most experience) will assume leadership of the
warband until the Blood Sister transforms. If the warband
does not contain a Blood Sister then leadership is allocated as
above and a new vampire may be recruited after the next
battle. If during the post-battle phase the warband contains
neither a vampire nor a necromancer either because they have
been killed or never recruited, then any skeletons and wight
henchmen in the warband are lost as the magic which
sustains them is dispelled.
Habituation: Vampires' human servants rapidly have to
become accustomed to the uncanny nature of their Mistresses
and their undead minions. The human members of an Lahmia
warband are immune to fear caused by types of undead in
their own warband, i.e: skeletons, wights, vampires, etc.
Other types of undead cause fear as normal.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

1 Lahmia Vampire
110 gold crowns to hire
Beautiful yet deadly, these seductive mistresses of undeath stalk the
halls of their long-lost homes, searching for who knows what?
Perhaps some far-off recollection of their long-vanished years
walking in the sunlight and the joy of life...

Thralls will become frenzied and immediately take the most
direct route to her aid, attacking any model within 2" either
side of a direct line to the Lahmia. If the vampire is taken out
of action, the Beloved will immediately hate the model who
did the damage and attempt to kill them at the earliest
opportunity. The beloved will remain frenzied until the hated
enemy is slain.
Favoured: If the Lahmia's Beloved is killed, she may choose
one of her Thralls to replace him by granting him the Blood
Kiss at his next advance. If this option is taken the Thralls'
leadership is increased to 8 if not already so and he takes the
place of the Beloved in the warband's roster. The Thrall's
elevation to Beloved counts instead of any advance he may
be entitled to. A new Thrall may be recruited after the
warband's next battle.


0-1 Blood Sister

Lahmian vampires are solitary creatures, but the preservation of the
bloodline is a priority for them. Young maidens are carefully

should be destroyed. These girls stand on the boundary of life and
death. Not fully undead, but no longer wholly human...

Special Rules:
Hardened: Blood Sisters are accustomed to the ways of
undead. Hence they are immune to fear and never test for
being all alone.
Demi-Vampires: If the warband's Lahmia is killed, the
Blood Sister may take her place. At her next advance she will
become a vampire on a roll of 4+ on a d6. This counts instead
of the advance. The blood Sister retains her existing skills
and experience but the usual rules for undead apply
immediately and her maximum stats become those of a
vampire. If the Blood Sister fails to transform, roll again at
her next and all subsequent advances. Once a Blood Sister
has become a vampire a new Blood Sister may be recruited
into the warband after the next game.

0-1 Beloved
Lahmians are attracted to mortals of strong will and strong body.
Their seduction gives the vampires a special pleasure, and their
martial skills are evermore devoted to the will of their dark mistress.
Until, that is, she grows tired of them or finds a more interesting
lover...
Beloved: The Beloved maybe chosen from any hero in a
human warband other then Middenheim, Witch Hunters,
Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed, Carnival of Chaos and any hero

#### Tilean Warband

The land of Tilea is home to some of the most wealthy and
aloof people in the Old World. A land that is divided by its
own competition of trade and separated by personal feuds and
warring city-states. It is civic pride and a desire for financial
status that drives each and every Tilean. To this end, the
Tileans have become proficient sailors and explorers. They
set sail for all ports in the Old World and drop anchor off the
shores of far distant lands in search of gold and precious
artefacts that can often bring a hefty price in any market of
the world.
Tilean warbands are often hired to explore the steamy
jungles, hot deserts or even the ruined city like Mordheim
either by their patron city-state or by wealthy merchants or
guilds. There are many city-states in Tilea to base a
warband’s history on although only the most prominent three
will be dealt with here. You can create a pirate warband
hailing from Sartosa or a warband of acolytes of the patron
god Lucan from Luccini if you so desire. Whatever warband
suites your fancy you’ll find that the land of Tilea is rich with
history to base it upon. You’ll also find a Tilean warband to
be structured much like the mercenary warbands but there are
subtle differences that reflect the rich Tilean history.

##### Miragleans

The Miragleans are deadly accurate with the city’s official
weapon, the crossbow. Therefore Miraglean Heroes have a
+1 to hit when using crossbows only. Marksmen get a +1 to
hit with any missile weapon they use (this is included in the
marksmen’s profile). All Miragleans have a deep-seated
hatred toward Skaven. This dates back to the red pox
outbreak of 1812 when three quarters of the population of the
city perished. When fighting Skaven a Miraglean warband
will be affected by the rules for Hatred towards them. Hired
swords are not affected by the Hatred rule.
Hired Swords: Miragleans warband cannot have Skaven
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Remasens

In 1487 a fleet of Dark Elf warships invaded the coastal city
of Remas and ever since the people of that city have a deep
dislike of the Druchii. A warband from Remas will fight to
the death against any Dark Elf warband they encounter. To
represent this, the Remasen player is allowed to re-roll any
rout test one time and must abide by the second roll. This
only applies when fighting Dark Elves. Remasen officers are
steadfast individuals whose years of training have afforded
them excellent leadership. The leadership value of a Remasen
captain, champion and young blood are always one point
higher regardless of whom they are fighting.
Hired Swords: Remasens warband cannot have Dark Elf
Hired Swords.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

##### Trantios

A warband hailing from Trantio will be the best-equipped
and most experienced human warband in Lustria. To
represent this a Trantio war band will always start a one-off
match with an extra 100 GC and in a Lustrian campaign they
will start with an extra 20% GC added to their total.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

Your warband must include a minimum of 3 models to a
maximum of 15 models. You have 500 points to assemble
your warband with. The maximum characteristics for each
type will be the same as any Mordheim mercenary warband.
Captain: Each Tilean Warband must have one Captain to
lead it – no more, no less.
Champion: Your Warband may include up to two
Champions.
Youngbloods: Your Warband may include up to two
Youngbloods.
Warriors: Your Warband may include any number of
Warriors.

Marksmen.

close combat.


#### Outlaw Warband

To the north of the River Stir lies the Great Forest, a vast
expanse of woodland that fills the very heart of the Empire.
Bounded along its southern edge by the river, this, the largest
forest of the known world, extends league upon league as far
as any man can see. Just at its southernmost, the River Stir
separates a small part of the forest from the main bulk of the
woodland and this smaller area of forest is known locally as
Stirwood. Small though Stirwood may be – indeed, this part
of the forest is not even on the same scale as the sacred Forest
of Loren, but, as many say, size isn’t everything – Stirwood
Forest is nevertheless still large enough to get lost in, and
many have done so, some by accident and some by design.
Stirwood lies just north of the noble city of Nuln and to the
west of Wurtbad, where law and order are strictly enforced,
at least they are strictly enforced once the City Guards have
finally managed to catch up with those who break the
Count’s law. The Elector Count of Stirland was well known
as a man that one should not cross. Those that did so were
inevitably declared as ‘outlaws’ and were pursued from the
cities. Even the most petty of criminals, some still quite
young, could be declared ‘outlaw’ and had little option but to
flee to the countryside. Many perished, both young and old,
but some made it to Stirwood where they could lay low.
During their time in Stirwood, some would band together and
become groups of outlaws, rather than just attempting to
survive on their own. The forest was a perfect training ground
to develop their skills, particularly in archery, where even the
hunting of the wild deer, the Count’s deer, was a crime in
itself. Illicit deer-hunting was not their only past-time as
many an unwary traveller, passing unsuspectingly through
the forest, would find themselves ambushed and relieved of
their goods.
Monks also lived in these parts, holy men who spent their
time in devotion to the blessed Sigmar. Usually they dwelt
alone in contemplation, but were often trusted by the local
groups of outlaws that they came into contact with and
attended to their spiritual needs, and, when the occasion
arose, also attended to their wounds.

In the years that followed the sighting of the twin-tailed star
in the sky, it was inevitable that tales of Mordheim would
have travelled down the waters of the River Stir. Tales of
strange sights and great riches would easily have reached the
inhabitants of Stirwood Forest. Temptations of this enormous
wealth that was rumoured to be in the shattered city would
have been hard for any group of outlaws to resist.
##### Special Rules

All warriors in an Outlaws warband may be equipped with
only one missile weapon at any time. All warriors must carry
a type of bow, but not crossbows, as part of their equipment.
So, even if an Outlaw acquires skills that allow him to use
additional ballistic weaponry, he cannot do so. The only
exception to this is the Monk who may choose to carry a
bow, but is not compelled to do so.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral.
##### Choice of Warriors

An Outlaw warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 gold crowns that you can use to recruit
and equip your warband. The maximum number of warriors
in the warband is 15.
Bandit Leader: Each Outlaw warband must have one Bandit
Leader: no more, no less!
Champion: Your warband may include up to two
Champions.
Petty Thieves: Your warband may include up to two Petty
Thieves.
Monk: Your warband may include up to one Monk, but he
can only be taken instead of either a Champion or a Petty
Thief.
Marksmen: Your warband may include up to a maximum of
seven Marksmen.
Outlaws: Your warband may include any number of
Outlaws.
##### Starting Experience

The Bandit Leader starts with 20 experience.
Champions & a Monk start with 8 experience.
Petty Thieves start with 0 experience.
All Henchmen start with 0 experience.

1 Bandit Leader
60 Gold Crowns to hire
A Bandit Leader is a professional cutthroat, a hardened criminal. His
presence along the shadowy forest tracks of Stirwood has often

contemplation of his devotion to Sigmar. However, some will see

activities of groups of outlaws. Their knowledge of healing is often
valued by other members.

#### Pit Fighter Warband

All across the world you can find gladiatorial pit fights, here
you can find hardy fighters taking up arms against each other.
From the vicious pits of Cutthroat’s Haven to the Black Pits
surrounding Mordheim there can be heard the clash of steel.
In most places local law itself bans these fights, but the
culture itself remains a haven for ex-mercenaries, escaped
convicts and itinerant conmen and bribes to local officials
ensures that this brutal sport continues unabated.
There are as many different type of fight as there are venues,
from small fistfights in an old barn or a back alley to huge
conflicts with many heavily armed combatants. Most fighters
are slaves who work for the so-called ‘circuit’. They try to
earn their freedom by paying off their owners with a large cut
of the winnings. Most successful Pit Fighters live for the
sport (and of course often die for it also!) because they know
of little else.
The men in this Warband consist solely of professional Pit
Fighters who were either able to buy their freedom or have
escaped. Now they roam the streets of Mordheim in search
for the Wyrdstone that would bring them wealth faster than
anyone can imagine.
The Pit Fighters are used to fighting in streets and small
corridors and this makes them a much-feared opponent. The
Pit King is the most skilled and cunning Pit Fighter of them
all who leads his band with an iron fist.
Appearance: Pit Fighters are grizzled veteran warriors
covered with many scars of battle, they are armed with
special Pit Weapons and Armor, their bodies well developed
and muscular. They wear little clothing and only partial
armor known as Pit Armor.

##### Special Rules

All Pit Fighters have the Pit Fighter skill as described in the
Strength Skill List except the Pit Fighter Initiates. (Pit Fighter
Skill: +1 WS, +1 A when fighting in ruins, buildings and The
Pit.)
Free the Slaves!: Pit Fighters hate all Slavers. The Pit
Fighters will never sell their captured opponents to the
slavers.
In the Pit!: Pit Fighters who capture an opponent may decide
to let him fight in the infamous fighting pits of Cutthroat’s
Haven.
The Pit Fighter Warband may decide to send in one or more
of their own fighters to fight the captive, if the Pit Fighter
wins he gains +2 Experience, the Warband gets all the
Captive’s armor and weapons +50gc, if the Pit Fighter loses
then roll to see whether he is dead or injured as normal
(ignore all following results: Robbed, Captured, Hardened,
Sold to the Pits and Survives Against the Odds), he will not
lose his armor or weapons, the Captive will get the 50 GC
and the +2 Experience when he wins. If the Captive wins the
audience decides whether he gains his freedom. Roll a D6 on
a 4+ the audience raise their thumbs and he is free. A 1-3
means he remains the Pit Fighters Captive and may be fielded
in the pits after future games

following: Lawful / Neutral, Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.

0-1 Dwarf Troll Slayer
50 gold crowns to hire
Troll Slayers are members of the morbid Dwarf cult obsessed with
seeking an honourable death in combat. Having committed some
unforgivable crime or been dishonoured in some way, a Dwarf will
forsake his home and wander off to die fighting the enemies of
Dwarf kind. Troll Slayers are insanely dangerous individuals,
psychopathic and violent. There are, however, few better fighters in
the Known World, so which place would be more fitting for them
than the dangerous fighting pits then! Battling against the most
hardened veterans and monsters known in the Old World, it seems
that they have found themselves a second place, to call home.

Hard Head: Dwarfs ignores the special rules for maces,
clubs, etc. They are not easy to knock out!
Hate Orcs and Goblins: All Dwarfs hate Orcs and Goblins.
See the psychology section of the Mordheim rules for details
on the effects of hatred.
Grudgebearers: Dwarfs hold an ancient grudge against
Elves from the days when the two races fought for the
supremacy of the Old World. If the Pit Fighters ever hire any
kind of Elven Hired Sword he will leave the Warband
immediately, he refuses to fight alongside these pansy Elves!
Death Wish: Troll Slayers seek an honourable death in
combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and

#### Norse Warband

O’ Sigmar preserve us from the wrath of the Norsemen’
The land of Norsca lies to the far north of the Empire across
the stormy sea of Claws. This is a harsh land of snow and ice
with mountains of Frost and Dusk that reach unto the heavens
themselves and march right down to the sea. The humans that
live here are powerfully built, with large, well muscled
frames and long limbs. The Norse are a bloodthirsty people
whose society is based entirely around war and fighting.
They make or produce very little in their inhospitable
homeland and their attitude is to take whatever they need
from the lands of others. Many a time their dreaded longships
have brought terror and destruction to the lands of men and
the other races. The Norse people live in marauder tribes or
clans much like the Unberogens who were, centuries earlier,
the founders of the Empire. It is for these reasons that the
Norse are seen as a very primitive and uncivilised race by
others and indeed many Norse tribes openly worship the dark
gods of Chaos as their own.
All Norse warriors are trained in the art of war at a very
young age and become skilled in the use of sword, axe and
shield for their’s is a brutal society where only the strongest
survive. Probably because of their well founded fearsome
reputation the Norsemen have few allegiances apart from to
their clan and their ancestors and so make excellent
mercenaries.
Despite their brutish behaviour the Norse make superb
natural sailors rivalling even the High Elves and it was
indeed the Norse who were the first humans to discover
Lustria and the South Lands. In their longships, the Norse
sailed from the Old World to Lustria, establishing the first
colony, Skeggi. The Norse plague the coast of Lustria raiding
many coastal settlements but it is their desire for riches and
saga that have driven them further inland to pillage the
temples of the Slann.

##### Special Rules

All Norse Warriors are subject to the following special rules:
Seamen: The Norse are a sea faring people and spend much
of their time rowing boats. To represent this, all Norse
warriors get +2 to Strength when trying to row a boat.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral, Neutral / Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

A Norse Warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial Warband.

##### Heroes

1 Jarl
70 Gold Crowns to hire
The Jarl of a Norse Warband is the most battle hardened veteran of
his group and often a lesser clan chieftain of his tribe. He has seen
many battles and is used to the bloodshed. While some Jarls choose

with the rest of the warriors. However the Jarl decides to run his
Warband, all of the other warriors respect him and look up to him.

#### Dark Elf Warband

Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High
Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are
better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure
have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave
destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly
feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted
forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark
Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for
this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves.
The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in
their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark
God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the
Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting
pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.
Despite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled
as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It
is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that
bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in
their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark
Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to
the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands
don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.

##### Special Rules

Kindred Hatred: The Dark Elves have been fighting the
High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two
races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves
Hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf Hired Swords.

Excellent Sight: There are numerous legends detailing the
excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin.
Elves can spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away than
normal warriors. (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches)

powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and
unreliable.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.

35 Gold Crowns to hire
The Dark Elves are cruel and fierce fighters. This is especially true
of the Corsairs – the Black Ark Raiders. They are skilled with sword
and axe, as well as the repeater crossbow, the distinct missile
weapon of the Dark Elves. Whenever a Black Ark explores the coast
of Lustria the Corsairs are the first to launch raiding parties.

0-5 Shades
30 Gold Crowns to hire

determining if they can detect him.

0-2 Cold One Beasthounds
30 Gold Crowns to hire
The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. One such animal was
discovered in Lustria. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beasthound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beasthounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beasthound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 0 4 4 1 1 1 4
Weapons/Armor: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and
do not need any weapons save their claws and massive jaws.
Special Rules
Animals: Cold One Beasthounds are animals and all animal
rules apply to them, they never gain experience.
Beastmaster: Cold One Beasthounds are nasty viscous
brutes that are barely kept under control. If the Beastmaster
dies the beasts will immediately escape from the warband and
they are removed from the warband roster. If the Beastmaster
is unable to participate in a battle, then neither will the beasts.
Stupidity: Cold One Beasthounds may use the basic
Leadership of the Beastmaster if they are within 6" of him.
They may never use the Leadership of the warband leader,
nor may they benefit from the Beastmaster’s increased
Leadership if he is within 6" of the leader.
Scaly Skin: Cold One Beasthounds have tough scaly skin,
and are considered to have a 6+ armor save. This save
cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.
Fear: Cold One Beasthounds cause Fear.

#### Clan Eshin

Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared
his world with another and altogether different race. There
have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a
scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer,
scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these
creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the
world of man, undermining his great cities, infiltrating his
sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world
spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests. These creatures call
themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the mutant spawn of
an older age of chaos and mutation.
Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from
their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries
they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague
in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least
they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has
suddenly changed. Now the destruction of Mordheim has
created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind.
Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for
the stones of power that men in their ignorance call
wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as
warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of
gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that
commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that
spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their
blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul
sorceries. Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has
been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown
increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has
appeared – a dark blessing from the skies!
For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune
time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is
divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan
fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of
the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race.
Mordheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else
the City of the Damned would already be overrun with
ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this
secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous
armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of
Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to

gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan
nests.
The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their
task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes,
they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the
thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors
practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned
Rat, their ever hungering and hideous god. There are none
better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure
of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient.
Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim
there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions
upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the
Damned.

#### Clan Moulder

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander
To the north, in the blasted wasteland known as the Troll
Country, lie the infernal breeding pits of Clan Moulder. Their
stronghold is burrowed into the walls and floor of a ragged
chasm in a snowy mountainside in the northern spur of the
Worlds Edge Mountains. Volcanic pools at the bottom of the
chasm raise a greyish plume of steam and vapours over it and
mix the stink of sulphur with the stench of matted fur and
excrement carried on the wind. Worse than the stench is the
dreadful cacophony of howls, squawks, screams, snarls and
shrieks which clamour out of the frozen chasm like the
wailing, lost souls of a thousand different races. It is not
without good reason that this place is known as the Hell Pit.
Clan Moulder is constantly seeking new, stable breeds of
fighting beasts that they can sell or hire to the other clans.
Small bands of Packmasters scour the lands around Hell Pit
for creatures to capture for their diabolic experimentation.
Chaos monsters from the Northern Wastes are the most
dangerous but also the most valuable by far. Huge and
monstrous creatures always offer the best chance to create a
new breed of fighting beasts. Clan Moulder hunters will trail
a Manticore or Hydra for months waiting for an opportunity
to strike. Captured beasts are hauled away into Hell Pit in
great iron cages. Once in the pit they are exposed to
Warpstone and fed on carefully measured amounts of it until
the desired mutations start to form. Rumours abound of the
crossbred monstrosities they have created of which the
fearsome Rat Ogre is undoubtedly the most infamous. Rat-
like wolves have also been seen prowling in Kislev, along
with curious furred breeds of troll and huge, seldom-seen
burrowing creatures. Some of the beasts the Packmasters
catch are simply trained and sold to other clans. Clan
Moulder Packmasters are experts in training wild and vicious
monsters. Truculent beasts are broken so that they obey and
passive creatures goaded until they become killers. The
bottom of Hell Pit is filled with the detritus of the clan's
failed experiments: pale twisted monstrosities that shamble or

flop across the floor of the chasm and feed on one another.
Clan Moulder is the clan with the most experience and
knowledge about the effects of Warpstone, possible with the
exception of the Order of Grey Seers.

growth or insect like tails. Those that truly lupines are kept in

#### Clan Pestilens

Jarod glanced down the street... All seemed clear. He could not immediately tell why, but he was sure someone, or something was there.
Maybe it was just that strange odour hanging around the ruins here. He shivered, although Mordheim seemed to have its own special smell,
this made him think of death.
A sudden noise made him jump up and bring his crossbow to bear on the still empty street. A strange mist started to creep in and soft
squeaks could be made out. As Jarod sounded the alarm, two figures rushed towards him. Dressed in tattered cloaks, they wielded what
looked like a spiked censer. Almost suffocating in the bellowing smoke, he fired his crossbow. Then, just before the spiked smoking ball
smashed his skull, he saw two red gleaming eyes in a disease ridden skaven face.
In the Old World sickness and plague are a fact of life and
many people blame rats for spreading contagion. They are
more right than they know.
Clan Pestilens exist to spread plague and pestilence through
their foul rites and experiments. They have been chosen by
the Horned Rat himself as his Disciples of Decay and are
responsible for more deaths than any other clan, mainly due
to the plagues and diseases they have unleashed on the cities
and empires in the Old World. The main strongholds of Clan
Pestilens consist of captured Slann temple-cities in the humid
jungles of Lustria and a mighty stronghold in the southlands.
They also have their own quarter in Skavenblight,
maintaining their position as one of the most powerful clans
in the Skaven Under-Empire.
Plague Monks favour knives and staffs while the higher
ranked members carry heavier weapons and even warplock
pistols. The knives are long and serrated and are often rusty
or smeared in rotten corpses to ensure that the any non-lethal
wound becomes infected. The Clan members do not need to
wear armor since their bodies are hardened by the diseases
they carry they feel little pain, they rely on their thick fur to
protect them. The robes themselves offer protection equal to
soft leather and will be considered as light armor when
combined with the scattered pieces of chain mail or plate that
some plague monks do wear underneath their putrid robes.

#### Clan Skryre

This warband was based from the Skaven Warbands by Michael Hulsander and the Skryre Warband by Chris Haak
After the Eshin Clan had their coffers bolstered by the
warpstone collected from Mordheim clan Skryre became
suspicious. Ikit Klaw sent out his spies and found that
Mordheim offered a source of warpstone far easier to acquire
than mining. It would also be a great testing ground for their
new weapons of destruction.
The warped genius of the Skaven engineers is concentrated in
the work of Clan Skryre. They are the most technologically
advanced, using warpstone technology to create formidable
combat teams able to survive the City of Evil, and return with
hoards of warpstone for their warlock engineers.
Jezzail rifles, poisoned wind globes, and Warpfire throwers
are all the creations of Clan Skryre, the engineers. These
skaven are more intelligent than most, and design the war
machines used by skaven in massed warfare. When turned
upon the streets of Mordheim, the effects of these weapons
can be devastating.
Clan Skryre Warbands have great technological knowledge
and prefer Magic and Technology to combat.

##### Special Rules

0-1 Clan Skryre Rat Ogre
300 gold crowns to hire
The warlock engineers of Clan Skryre are renowned for their
fiendish inventions which utilize a blend of foul magic and arcane
machinery. The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is the pinnacle of their
devilish engineering, utilizing the corpse of a Rat Ogre combined
with a mechanical exoskeleton and powered by refined wyrdstone.
Clan Skryre has sent out the handful that it has made to further test
them in combat. In battle it is a terrifying if somewhat unreliable
beast.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 3 3 5 5 3 1 3 10
Weapons/Armor: Jaws, claws, and a miniature Warpfire
thrower on its mechanical left arm.
Special Rules
Bio Machinery: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not alive as
such, being a monstrous combination of dead flesh, arcane
Skaven technology and dark sorcery. The Clan Skryre Rat
Ogre is immune to psychology and never leaves combat.
Experience: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres never gains
experiences.
Fear: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a fearsome, monstrous
beast that causes fear.
Immune to Poison: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is not affected
by any poisons.
Large: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge creature that
towers above the heads of its fellow Skaven and men alike.
Any warrior may shoot at a Rat Ogre, even if it is not the
closet target.
May Not Run: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogre is a huge
lumbering monster-machine that lacks the sheer animal speed
of a living Rat Ogre. It may not run but may charge.
Metallic Body: These give Clan Skryre Rat Ogre a 4+
armor save.
Unreliable: The technology of biomechanics is still pretty
much in its infancy and as with most Clan Skryre
experiments is neither safe nor entirely reliable! At the
beginning of each turn, the Skaven player should roll a D6 to

activate and work the Rat Ogre. On a roll of 2-6 everything is
fine and the Rat Ogre may be moved normally. On the roll of
a 1, something has gone drastically wrong — roll again on
the Malfunction table.
Upkeep: The Clan Skryre Rat Ogres is always in need of
repair after battle and so the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres has an
upkeep of 35 GC, or the Clan Skryre Rat Ogres stops
working.
Malfunction table
D6 Result
1 Explodes: Something has gone horribly wrong with
the Rat Ogre's warpstone generator and it has
overloaded, exploding in a bright green flash! All
models within 6” of the Rat Ogre receive a single
Strength 5 hit. The Rat Ogre is completely destroyed.
Do not roll for injuries after the game.
2 Goes Berserk! From now until the end of the game,
the Rat Ogre is out of control. At the start of each of
the Skaven player's turns, the Rat Ogre will move
randomly (use the Artillery Scatter dice from
Warhammer to determine the distance and direction
moved) — if there are any warriors within charge
range (of either side) it will charge them, otherwise it
will move full pace towards the nearest warrior.
3 Shuts Down: The warpstone generator fizzles out and
the Rat Ogre comes to a halt for the rest of the battle.
It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.
4 Temporary Loss of Control: The Rat Ogre moves in
a random direction and if it comes into contact with
any warriors (of either side) it attacks and counts as
charging. If it does not move into contact with any
warriors but there are warriors within range of its
Warpfire thrower, it will fire this at them instead.
5-6 Freezes: The Rat Ogre just freezes on the spot for this
turn. It is hit automatically if engaged in close combat.


#### Orc Mob

Orcs enjoy fighting and looting more than anything else. Because of this, an Orc’s life is spent in constant battle – either
with his fellow Orcs or some other enemy. With its wealth of opponents and loot ready for the taking, Mordheim offers
the perfect opportunity for an aspiring Orc Warboss to prove himself. What follows are complete rules, written by
Mark Havener, for Orc & Goblin warbands.
Among the races of the Warhammer world, none enjoy the
prospect of a good looting more than Orcs and Goblins. For
this reason many Orc warbands have been drawn to the city
of Mordheim and the wyrdstone that lies hidden there. Of
course, Orcs would much rather ambush other warbands and
take their wyrdstone than collect it themselves, but their goals
are the same as any other warband – collect as much treasure
as possible! These traits are reflected in the following special
rules:

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In
any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.

2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

An Orc warband must include a minimum of three models.
You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to recruit and

0-1 Orc Shaman
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc Shamans are outcasts from Orc society. They are gifted by the
Orc gods Gork and Mork with powers they can neither understand
nor completely control. Many join roaming Orc warbands where
they are no longer shunned for their abilities, but respected for
them.

0-3 Orc Big ‘Uns
40 gold crowns to hire
Orc society is a savage hierarchy where only the toughest survive
and rise through the ranks (often atop the bodies of other
challengers). Big ’Uns are such rising stars, and they carry out the
orders of the Orc Boss. If the Boss ever falls, it is up to the Big ’Uns
to decide on a new leader (usually through personal combat).

##### Henchmen

(Bought in groups of 1-5)
Goblin Warriors
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins are often used as cannon fodder (as well as a food source in
lean times!) by their larger Orc cousins. They are usually not as
well equipped as Orc Boyz, having to make do with whatever the
Orcs do not want or cannot use.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

4 2 3 3 3 1 3 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Goblins may be armed with weapons
and armor chosen from Goblin equipment list.
Special Rules
Animosity: Goblin Warriors are subject to the rules for
Animosity (see Special Rules for details). Note: A Goblin
Warrior who fails his Animosity test and rolls a 1 for the
result will never charge an Orc Henchman, though he will
still use any missile weapons to attack as normal. Goblins are
far too afraid of Orcs to challenge them individually.
Not Orcs: Orcs don’t expect much from non-Orcs, and are
therefore not unsettled if Goblins or Cave Squigs break or get
cut down in battle. In fact, they expect as much from these
weaklings! Therefore, when testing to see if an Orc Warband
needs to take a Rout test, each Goblin Warrior or Cave Squig
taken out of action only counts as half a model. Therefore, a
band of 5 Orcs and 10 Goblins (15 models) would only have
to take a test if 4 models fell (4 Orcs or 8 Goblins, or some
combination thereof).
Runts: Goblins may gain experience but if they happen to
roll ‘That Lad’s got talent’ they are immediately killed by
their Orc overlords for becoming too ‘mouthy’ (remove the
Gobbo from the roster).

0-5 Cave Squigs
15 gold crowns to hire
Goblins raise the deadly Cave Squigs. These creatures are a curious
blend of animal and fungus, and are composed mostly of teeth,
horns, and a nasty temperament.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Weapons/Armor: Big gob and brutality! Cave Squigs
never use or need weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
a Goblin Warrior, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without a Goblin within 6" at the start of its
Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point on, move
the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each of its
Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact with
another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model in
hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of the
Orc & Goblin player’s control until the end of the game.

Not Orcs: See Goblin Warriors entry for rules.
Animals: Cave Squigs are animals of a sort and so do not
gain experience.
 
Orc Boyz
25 gold crowns to hire
Orc Boyz are savage and tough. They fear nothing that they can get
their bare hands on, though they are even more ignorant and
superstitious than most other beings in the Warhammer world. They
form the core of any Orc warband.

large amounts of food can often instill a certain loyalty in them.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armor: Trolls do not require weapons to fight
but often carry a big club. In any event, Trolls can never be
given weapons or armor.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Dumb Monster: A Troll is far too stupid to ever learn any
new skills. Trolls do not gain experience.
Always Hungry: A Troll requires an upkeep cost. This
upkeep represents the copious amounts of food that must be
fed to the Troll in order to keep him loyal to the warband.
The warband must pay 15 gold crowns after every game in
order to keep the Troll. If the warband lacks the gold to pay
the upkeep, the Boss has the option of sacrificing two Goblin
Warriors or Cave Squigs to the Troll in lieu of buying food
(Trolls eat nearly anything). If this fee is not paid (either in
gold or in warband members) the Troll gets hungry and
wanders off in search of food.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Troll can
regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive juices on an
unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This is a single
attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5 and ignores
armor saves.


#### Black Orc Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Smarter, stronger, more vicious and better equipped than the
normal Orc (and that’s saying something when you’re talking
about Orcs), Black Orcs are amongst some of the worst foes
anyone can face in single combat...and a band of them is
certainly something to put the fear into the hearts of men!
They do appear more built than born and it is little wonder
that there are many rumours regarding their origins.
Since the Storm of Chaos there are many, many more of
these monsters now wandering the Empire, having followed
Grimgor Ironhide in his Waaagh! Where once the forces of
the Empire could have tracked down warbands of these
creatures in a matter of weeks, now there is no means or
enough men to perform such a task and thus the Black Orcs
roam freely.
What aims do the Black Orcs have? What is the point of a
tornado? It is meaningless to ponder such matters because all
the Orcs want is to fight and that means attacking whomever
crosses their path. What they gain from such battling is not
completely understood, but it seems to be nothing more
complicated than the chance to fight. There is no logic from
them nor can any be expected.

##### Special Rules

Animosity. Orcs and Goblins enjoy nothing more than a
good scrap, unfortunately they’re not always very discerning
about who they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of
the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is
either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior
has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or
said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how
offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the
following chart to see what happens:
D6 Result:
1 “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly
Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal
hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if
there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest
to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately
charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the
source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the
models will immediately move 1" apart and no longer count
as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another
Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no
friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within
charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon,
he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or
Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above
applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In

any case, the warrior in question may take no other action
this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-
to-hand combat.
2-5 “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard
an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin,
but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at
his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may
defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.
6. “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are
laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly
names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one
to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible
towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if
possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc
or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately.
This move is in addition to his regular move in the
Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single
turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin
warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior
must charge into close combat during his regular movement.
Let the goons do the work: Black Orcs rely on themselves
to do the killing and do not ride mounts of any kind. Only
normal Orcs may ride a boar or other such mount.
Da Boss is Dead!: If the Boss should be killed a Black Orc
will always assume leadership of the warband before any
other type, irrespective of relative experience. The
replacement will automatically acquire the "Oi Behave!"
skill.
Alignment: The Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.

##### Choice of Warriors

A Black Orc warband must include a minimum of three
models. You have 500 Gold Crowns with which you can use
to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.
Black Orc Boss: Each Black Orc warband must have one
Black Orc Boss.
Black Orcs: Your warband may include up to 2 Black Orcs
Young’uns: Your warband can include up to 2 Young’uns.
Orc Boys: Any number of models may be Orc Boys
Orc Shootaz: May only have as many Shootaz as the
warband has Boyz.

1 Black Orc Boss
90 gold crowns to hire
Amongst some of the toughest of the tough, a Black Orc Boss has
fought in numerous battles and proven to the gods just how truly
powerful they can become. Taking a warband is the start of their
ambitions as they will seek victories to meld the Boyz into larger
and larger warbands until they have a Horde at their beck and call.

Black Orc: Model starts with a natural 6+ Armor Save.
This save may be combined with other equipment to improve

Oi Behave!: If any Henchman fails his Animosity test within
6” of the Boss, the player may opt to have the boss stamp his
authority (and clenched fist) on the situation.
The misbehaving Henchman will receive an automatic hit at
the strength of the Orc player’s choosing. If the Henchman is
still on his feet after his slap, he may add a number equal to
the strength of the slap to his subsequent roll to determine the
effects of Animosity.
e.g. The player decides that the Boss will hit a misbehaving
Henchman with a S2 slap. If the slap fails to Knock Down,
Stun or Out of Action the Henchman, then he adds +2 to the
Animosity Effect roll.

0-2 Black Orc

In it for the mayhem and maybe a little loyalty to the Boss of the

that killing is only at arm’s reach all the time and they don’t care
what the target is. Whether it is some Imperial peasant, a herd of
Beastmen or even the Boyz in the warband, the Black Orcs just
don’t care as long as they get to crump something!

Not all Orcs enjoy getting into a fight straight away. Some are
hunters, tracking prey and shooting it down from a distance; others
recognise that sometimes you need to soften up a really tough foe
from a distance before moving in to finish them off. This is the
closest Orcs come to outright cowardice.

Savage Orcs persist in their primitive ways to this day. Even by
Orcish standards, they are a complete bunch of primitives. They use

minds and they may never learn Academic Skills should they
become a Hero on an Advance Roll.
Savage: Savage Orcs are subject to Frenzy as detailed in the
Psychology section of the Mordheim rulebook. They must
always run or charge towards the nearest opponent they can
see. If no enemy is visible they are moved under the player’s
control. They can never use any form of armor or ranged
weapons. Savage Orcs are also so primitive for other Boyz
and can never have the Leader ability or use their Ld stat for
rout tests, unless they are the only models from the warband
left on the board.


#### Forest Goblin Mob

From the Nemesis Crown
Forest Goblin tribes dwell deep within The Great Forest. They have completely adapted to their surroundings, learning stealth
and camouflage to evade their neighbours.
Gold motivates the Forest Goblins as it does any warband, albeit for different reasons. It is worthless to them as currency but
as a metallic resource, it is valuable nonetheless. Instead of using gold to buy weapons and armor, Forest Goblins actually
coat their stone equipment with the metal. This has led unscrupulous leaders to send their henchmen into certain ambush, only
to arrive later to collect the arrowheads and spear points from the remains of their former employees
Forest Goblins are able to create poisons with a precision surpassing even the Dark Elves. Their natural surroundings
harbour any number of poisonous creatures, including the gigantic spiders they are rumoured to prod into combat with their
enemies. Coating their weapons with deadly venom, the Goblins are capable of felling any foe, no matter their size. Led by
their Chieftain (usually the Goblin with the loudest voice), the Forest Goblins appear from nowhere and strike with feral
ferocity before receding into the trees, leaving injuries as the only proof they were ever there.

##### Special Rules

Natives: Used to poking through the underbrush, Forest
Goblins suffer no movement penalties from moving through
any wooded terrain.
Animosity: Goblins enjoy nothing more than a good scrap,
unfortunately they’re not always very discerning about who
they scrap with! To represent this, at the start of the Goblin
player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is either an
Orc or Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior has taken

not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat

warrior is armed with a missile weapon, he immediately
takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin
Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above applies,
or if the nearest friendly model is an Goblin Hero, the
warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart.

Giant Spider Mount: If you are using the optional rules for
mounts, then your warband’s heroes may ride giant spiders.
The rider’s armor save increased by +1, exactly as if mounted
on an ordinary horse. The rider need not dismount to climb
terrain (including building exteriors) and the spider’s natural
climbing abilities allow the rider to re-roll any failed
climbing attempts. The Giant Spider count as Rare 5 and

6. In close combat, the opponent may choose which to hit.
The Gigantic Spider no longer has to check for stupidity if it
is being ridden, as the Chieftain is directing its actions.



#### Hobgoblins Wolf Rider Mob

Based on Hobgoblin Raiders by the unnamed author and Hob Goblins Warband by Brian Coggin & James S. Mackay.
The acrid smell of wolf musk precedes them as they drift silently through the ruins. You know they’re somewhere, but still you
don’t see them. The sharp twangs of their bowstrings echoing through the city send you diving for cover, but it isn’t until the
deadly barbed arrows strike that you see your opponents. As you muster the warband, your cunning opposition is already
moving back into the shadows to circle for another guerrilla strike. The treacherous hobgoblins have arrived!

##### Background

Khans and their hobgoblin wolf riders have always plunged
deep into any territory where their swift swords and sure
arrows could bring them wealth, and Hogada Khan and his
Keregit raiders are no different. When human captives
revealed to Hogada the rumors of the untold riches available
in Mordheim, the opportunistic leader immediately
abandoned his orders from the Ka-Khan and steered his wolf
riders towards the City of the Dammed.
The Keregit raiders keep their camp on a constant move, and
few have discovered the motley collection of yurts and lived
to tell the tale. Years of constant warfare has taught Hogada
Khan that mobility and secrecy are his two greatest allies.
Certainly more reliable than most of his treacherous warriors.
Only a swift sword delivering death to those who oppose his
rule has kept this group together. Although the wealth the
hobgoblins are earning in Mordheim helps with loyalty, as it
far exceeds what they’re used to finding on the warpath.
Soon after arriving Hogada began raiding the city with large
groups of wolf riders, but the clever git quickly realized two
things. First, Mordheim is not the steppe, and large parties
cannot move through the ruins with the stealth and agility a
hobgoblin must have to survive. Secondly, the Khan
discovered that wolves were not the best form of
transportation through the rubble, as his warriors were
constantly dismounting to traverse small caverns, pass
through doorways, and climb to upper levels of buildings.
Now Hogada sends his Ilkhans, or subordinate khans, into the
city with small and stealthy raiding parties to gather the
precious wyrdstone. Although some of these groups still have
wolves as steeds, the majority of the raiders have retrained
their wolves to fight without riders.
The new system works well for the hobgoblins, and they’ve
seen a great deal of success since arriving on the scene. The
stealthy hobgoblins are deadly with their bows, and the
slavering wolves provide the raiders with an excellent fast
attack squad. As long as the treacherous warriors remain
disciplined, the hobgoblins are warbands to be reckoned with.

##### Special Rules

Treacherous Gits: Hobgoblins are notorious for their
treachery in all things, including combat. For all henchmen
not already in hand to hand combat roll a d6 at the beginning
of each turn. If they roll a 1 on that d6 then roll another and
reference the following chart:
1 – The treacherous git switches sides, and can now be
controlled by the opposing team for the rest of the
battle. If there are multiple opponents the hobgoblin
will attach himself the warband with the highest
rating. Note that this hobgoblin must still take
treachery tests, and therefore could end up back on his
original team
2-5 – The hobgoblin is too interested in saving his own skin
that he will refuse to shoot or charge this turn, but may
perform other actions.
6 – The henchman is infused with fresh determination and
loyalty, and doesn’t need to roll further treachery tests
for the rest of the game
Giant Wolves: The warband may include a number of Giant
Wolves as detailed below. These must be ridden into battle.
You may nominate either heroes or henchmen to ride these
wolves and the rules for mounted models in the Mordheim
book apply, however the riders will not dismount for any
reason during a battle, so it is generally a bad idea to have an
entire warband mounted. If the model is taken out of action
roll for both the rider and the wolf on the serious injury table.
You may switch riders between battles if you like. While
mounted models are unable to enter buildings in above-
ground scenarios they may still be ridden in tomb raider
scenarios, however due to their bulk and the nature of the
tombs mounted models may not run while inside of tombs,
and will only charge their normal move distance (a charge
must still be declared as normal, however, and you cannot
simply 'move' into hand to hand combat.)
Alignment: the Warband’s Alignment may be one of the
following: Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic.
##### Choice of Warriors

models. You have 500 gold crowns which you can use to
recruit and equip your warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband is 15.

### Campaigns

Warbands travel to the City of the Damned from all over the
Old World. They come from many races and for many
reasons but ultimately they must all face the dangers of the
dim alleys and twisting, winding streets of Mordheim.
Although it is great fun to fight individual battles, part of the
challenge of Mordheim is to build your warband into a force
to be reckoned with. A campaign gives your warband the
chance to gain experience and new skills, as well as the
opportunity to hire extra warriors as its fame and fortune
increases.

#### Starting a campaign

To start a campaign you’ll need at least two players,
preferably three or more. Players may have more than one
warband, but most people prefer to run one at a time, as this
allows them to devote more of their attention to painting,
modelling and playing with their favourite warband.
You can start a campaign as soon as two players have
recruited their warbands. New players can join the campaign
any time after that. Although the new warbands will be less
experienced they will soon learn new skills. Fighting other,
more powerful, warbands will allow them to develop more
quickly.

#### Playing a campaign game

To start the campaign, the two players select one of the
scenarios to fight (see the Scenarios section). At
the end of each game the players work out how much
experience their warriors have earned and how much
wyrdstone the warband has collected before returning to its
encampment.
Experience is expressed as Experience points which Heroes
and Henchmen groups receive for surviving each game. This
is covered later in the Experience section. When a Hero or a
group of Henchmen has sufficient Experience points they
receive an advance. An advance might improve a warrior’s
characteristics profile, adding to his WS, BS, S etc, or he
might gain a special skill such as Mighty Blow or Acrobat.
After each game the warriors collect wyrdstone. This is
recorded on the warband’s roster sheet, and can later be sold
for gold, used for trading, etc. You can recruit more warriors
or buy new weapons from traders. All this is explained in the
Income and Trading sections, later.

#### Warband rating

Each warband has a warband rating – the higher the rating
the better the warband. The warband rating is simply the
number of warriors in it multiplied by 5, plus their
accumulated experience.
Large creatures such as Rat Ogres are worth 20 points plus
the number of Experience points they have accumulated.
The warband’s rating changes after each game, because
surviving warriors will gain extra experience, warriors may
have been killed, new ones added, etc. Hopefully your
warband rating will go up, signifying your increase in power!

#### Post battle sequence

After the battle is over, both players work their way through
the following sequence. You do not have to work through it
all at once (try to do the first three parts straight after the
battle – you may wish to consider further purchases later) but

any dice rolls must be seen by both players or a neutral third
party.
1 Injuries. Determine the extent of injuries for each warrior
who is out of action at the end of the game. See the Serious
Injuries, on page 118.
2 Allocate experience. Heroes and Henchmen groups gain
experience for surviving battles. See the Experience and
Scenarios sections for details.
3 Roll on the Exploration chart. See the Income section for
details.
4 Sell Wyrdstone. This can only be done once per post battle
sequence.
5 Check available veterans. Roll to see how much
Experience worth of veterans is available for hire. You don’t
have to commit to hiring any at this point.
6 Make rarity rolls and buy rare items. Make rolls for any
rare items you intend to buy and pay for them. These items
go into the warband’s stash.
7 Look for Dramatis Personae. If you want to hire any.
8 Hire new recruits & buy common items. New recruits
come equipped with their free dagger and may be bought
common items. This is done in any order and may be done
several times. Note that newly hired recruits cannot buy rare
items. They can, however, be equipped with rare items if
there are any in the warband’s stash in stage 9.
9 Reallocate equipment. Swap equipment between models
as desired (provided they are eligible to use it).
10 Update your warband rating. You are now ready to
fight again.
#### Disbanding warbands

You may disband your old warband at the end of any game
and start again with a new one. All the warriors in the
original warband and any equipment and other benefits they
acquired are lost. You can also dismiss any warrior in your
warband at any time.
#### Death of a Warrior

When a warrior is killed (Hero or Henchman) all his weapons
and equipment are lost. This is very important, so be clear
about it from the start. It is not possible to reallocate a
warrior’s weapons or equipment once he is dead.
#### Death of a Leader

If the leader of the warband is slain, the Hero with the next
highest Leadership value takes command. He then gains the
Leader ability (although he must continue to use his original
Skill list) and can use the Equipment list available to the
leader. If there is more than one Hero eligible to assume
command, the warrior with the most Experience points
becomes the leader. In the case of a tie roll a D6 to decide the
new leader. Note that you may not hire a new leader for your
warband.
In the case of Undead warbands, the death of the Vampire
means that the warband’s Necromancer must take over. If the
warband doesn’t include one, the spells that hold the restless
dead together unravel, and the warband collapses into a pile
of bones. You can buy a Vampire after the next game, at
which point the Necromancer will step down (whether he
wants to or not) and lose the Leader skill.


If the leader of a Sisters of Sigmar, Possessed or Carnival of
Chaos warband dies then their successor will be entitled to
learn to use magic in their stead. The new leader may roll for
a prayer / spell from the appropriate list, instead of rolling on
the Advance table, the first time they are eligible for an
advance. After this they are considered to be a Magic / Pray
User as appropriate for their warband and use the Advance
table as normal.

#### Buying new equipment between games

As explained in the Trading section, warriors may purchase
new equipment and armaments using the warband’s treasury.
Warriors can also swap equipment between themselves.
Alternatively, old equipment can be hoarded and re-used at a
later date.
Weapons and armor purchased, swapped or taken from
storage for your warband must be of an appropriate type for
the warrior, as indicated by the warband lists. Record any
changes to the warrior’s equipment on the roster sheet.

#### Serious injuries

During a game some warriors will be taken out of action and
removed from play. At that time it doesn’t matter whether the
warrior is dead, unconscious, injured or just playing dead – in
game terms he is no longer capable of fighting in the battle
which is all that matters.
When you are playing a campaign it matters a great deal what
happens to warriors who are taken out of action! They might
recover completely and be ready to fight in the next battle, or
they might have sustained injuries. Worst of all they might
die, or be so badly injured that they have to retire.
When a Henchman receives a serious injury this is treated
differently than if a Hero received one (this is to represent the
greater effect that losing a Hero would have on your
warband). Working out the extent of a Henchman’s injuries is
very simple. You will need to roll on the chart opposite to
determine what has happened to your Hero. The chart covers
a whole range of injuries and random things that might befall
your warrior. Bear in mind that only Heroes who are taken
out of action are obliged to roll on this chart.

##### Henchman with Serious Injuries

Henchmen who are out of action at the end of the battle are
removed permanently from the roster sheet on a D6 roll of 1-
2. They have either suffered severe injuries, died of their
wounds, or decided to quit the warband. On a roll of 3-6 they
can fight in the next battle as normal.

##### Heroes with Serious Injuries

After a battle some of your Heroes may be taken out of
action. You will need to determine the extent of their injuries
before the next game.
To use the Heroes’ Serious Injuries chart opposite, roll two
D6. The first dice roll represents ‘tens’ and the second
‘units’, so that a roll of 1 and 5 is 15, a roll of 3 and 6 is 36,
etc. This type of dice roll is referred to as a ‘D66 roll’.


#### Heroes’ serious injuries chart (roll D66)

11-15 DEAD
The warrior is dead and his body is abandoned in the dark
alleys of Mordheim, never to be found again. All the
weapons and equipment he carried are lost. Remove him
from the warband’s roster.
16-21 MULTIPLE INJURIES
The warrior is not dead but has suffered a lot of wounds. Roll
D6 times on this table. Re-roll any ‘Dead’, ‘Captured’ and
further ‘Multiple Injuries’ results.
22 LEG WOUND
The warrior’s leg is broken. He suffers a -1 Movement
characteristic penalty from now on.
23 ARM WOUND
Roll again: 1 = Severe arm wound. The arm must be
amputated. The warrior may only use a single one handed
weapon from now on. 2-6 = Light wound. The warrior must
miss the next game.
24 MADNESS
Roll a D6. On a 1-3 the warrior suffers from stupidity; on 4-6
the warrior suffers from frenzy from now on (see the
Psychology section for details).
25 SMASHED LEG
Roll again: 1 = The warrior may not run any more but he may
still charge. 2-6 = The warrior misses the next game.
26 CHEST WOUND
The warrior has been badly wounded in the chest. He
recovers but is weakened by the injury so his Toughness is
reduced by -1.
31 BLINDED IN ONE EYE
The warrior survives but loses the sight in one eye; randomly
determine which. A character that loses an eye has his
Ballistic Skill reduced by -1. If the warrior is subsequently
blinded in his remaining good eye he must retire from the
warband.
32 OLD BATTLE WOUND
The warrior survives, but his wound will prevent him from
fighting if you roll a 1 on a D6 at the start of any battle. Roll
at the start of each battle from now on.
33 NERVOUS CONDITION
The warrior’s nervous system has been damaged. His
Initiative is permanently reduced by -1.
34 HAND INJURY
The warrior’s hand is badly injured. His Weapon Skill is
permanently reduced by -1.
35 DEEP WOUND
The warrior has suffered a serious wound and must miss the
next D3 games while he is recovering. He may do nothing at
all while recovering.
36 ROBBED
The warrior manages to escape, but all his weapons, armor
and equipment are lost.

41-55 FULL RECOVERY
The warrior has been knocked unconscious, or suffers a light
wound from which he makes a full recovery.
56 BITTER ENMITY
The warrior makes a full physical recovery, but is
psychologically scarred by his experience. From now on the
warrior hates the following (roll a D6):
D6 Result
1-3 The individual who caused the injury. If it was a Henchman,
he hates the enemy leader instead.
4 The leader of the warband that caused the injury.
5 The entire warband of the warrior responsible for the injury.
6 All warbands of that type.
61 CAPTURED
The warrior regains consciousness and finds himself held
captive by the other warband.
He may be ransomed at a price set by the captor or
exchanged for one of their warband who is being held
captive.
Captives may be sold to slavers at a price of D6x5 GC.
Undead may kill their captive and gain a new Zombie.
The Possessed may sacrifice the prisoner. The leader of the
warband will gain +1 Experience if they do so.
Captives who are exchanged or ransomed retain all their
weapons, armor and equipment; if captives are sold, killed
or turned to Zombies, their weaponry, etc, is retained by their
captors.
62-63 HARDENED
The warrior survives and becomes inured to the horrors of
Mordheim. From now on he is immune to fear.
64 HORRIBLE SCARS
The warrior causes fear from now on.
65 SOLD TO THE PITS
The warrior wakes up in the infamous fighting pits of
Cutthroat’s Haven and must fight against a Pit Fighter. See
the Hired Swords section for full rules for Pit Fighters.
Roll to see which side charges, and fight the battle as normal.
If the warrior loses, roll to see whether he is dead or injured
(i.e., a D66 roll of 11-35). If he is not dead, he is thrown out
of the fighting pits without his armor and weapons and may
re-join his warband.
If the warrior wins he gains 50 GC, +2 Experience and is free
to rejoin his warband with all his weapons and equipment.
66 SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS
The warrior survives and rejoins his warband. He gains +1
Experience.


### Experience

As warriors take part in battles, those who survive become
more experienced, and improve their battle skills. This is
represented in campaigns by Experience points.
Warriors earn Experience points when they take part in a
battle. Once a warrior has enough points he gains an advance.
This takes the form of an increased characteristic or a new
skill. Warriors who survive long enough may progress to
become great Heroes, with many skills that they have picked
up during their long and glorious fighting career.
When warriors are recruited, some of them already have
some experience. The warband lists detail how many
Experience points different warriors begin with. Record these
on your warband roster sheet by ticking the right number of
boxes. No extra advances are gained for this experience. It
simply represents the experience the warriors have
accumulated before the warband is formed.

#### Earning experience

The Experience points warriors earn depend on the scenario.
Different scenarios have different objectives and
consequently warriors can earn experience in slightly
different ways.
Extra Experience points are always added to the fighter’s
total after the game is over, though it is a good idea to keep a
record of the opponents your warrior puts out of action
during the battle, as this often affects the experience they
gain.
If you look through the scenarios you will notice that
warriors always earn +1 Experience point for surviving a
battle. They earn this even if they are injured – so long as
they live to fight again!
The Scenarios section includes details of how many
Experience points are earned for each scenario.

#### Experience advances

As warriors earn more Experience points they are entitled to
make Advance rolls. The warband roster sheet shows how
much experience a Hero or a Henchman group must
accumulate before making a further roll. When the
accumulated experience reaches a box that has thick borders,
the warrior may make an Advance roll. The roll(s) must be
taken immediately after the game in which the advance was
earned, while both players are present to witness the result.
Note that Henchmen gain experience as a group, and
consequently all the warriors in one group gain the same
advance.

#### Underdogs

If a warband is deemed to be significantly weaker than the other participating warbands it may be considered an Underdog - though this must be decided unanimously by all players. An Underdog warband will recieve a bonus +1 experience to all participating Heroes and Henchmen Groups. 

#### Advance rolls

Make Advance rolls straight after the battle so both players
can witness the result. Roll 2D6 and consult the appropriate
tables below.
##### Heroes

2D6 Result
2 - 5 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill. See the
Magic section.
6 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Strength; 4-6
= +1 Attack.
7 Characteristic Increase. Choose either +1 WS or +1 BS.
8 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Initiative; 4-6
= +1 Leadership.
9 Characteristic Increase. Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Wound; 4-6
= +1 Toughness.
10 - 12 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If he is a wizard he may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill.
##### Henchmen

All warriors in the group gain the
same advance.
2D6 Result
2 - 4 Advance +1 Initiative.
5 Advance +1 Strength.
6 - 7 Advance Choose either +1 BS or +1WS.
8 Advance +1 Attack.
9 Advance +1 Leadership.
10 - 12 The lad’s got talent. One model in the group becomes a
Hero. If you already have the maximum number of
Heroes, roll again. The new Hero remains the same
Henchman type (e.g., a Ghoul stays as a Ghoul) and starts
with the same experience the Henchman had, with all his
characteristic increases intact. You may choose two skill
lists available to Heroes in your warband. These are the
skill types your new Hero can choose from when he gains
new skills. He can immediately make one roll on the
Heroes Advance table. The remaining members of the
Henchmen group, if any, roll again for the advance that
they have earned.
#### New skills

There are several types of skill and each has a separate list.
You may not choose the same skill twice for the same
warrior. The skills a Hero may have are restricted by the
warband he belongs to and what type of Hero he is.
To select a new skill for a Hero, pick the type of skill you
want from those available, then choose which skill has been
learned.


### Skills & Abilities Lists

The Skill lists are used to pick skills earned as advances. Your warrior is restricted to specific Skill lists depending upon his
warband type and what kind of warrior he is. Each warband entry includes a list of skills available to the Heroes of that
particular warband.
All warbands have their own strengths and weaknesses which relate to the skills available to them. For example, the Possessed
are good fighters and very strong, but they are not very academically minded.
Some warbands also have access to a unique Skill list, which is clearly indicated in their entry.

#### Common Skills

The common skills are available to any Hero, Henchmen & Hired Sword who wishers for these Skills.
Animal\Beast Handler (e.g. War hound): This skill is highly
beneficial if non-ridden animals are to be included in a warband.
This skill must be taken for specific animals and may be taken
multiple times for different animals. It represents knowledge of the
general care and well being of the animal as well as training
techniques.

A warrior with this skill has a beneficial effect on the animals under
his care. If a warrior has the Animal Handling skill for a particular
animal, any such animals may use his Leadership provided he is
within 6". If the Warband’s leader is also nearby, a player may
choose which of the warriors’ Leadership to use unless the animal is
stupid, in which case only the handler’s Leadership may be used. In
addition, stubborn animals with a handler in base contact ignore the
effects of stubbornness.

Beast Companion: A Hero or Warrior with this skill may buy an
attack animal, the attack animal must be set up with the owning
model within 3". But free to move around once started. The attack
animal may use the owner Leadership if within 6". The attack
animal does not count towards the maximum number of warriors
allowed in your warband. If the owner is stunned or knocked down,
the attack animal will move to it owner and guard him\her until the
Owner get up or the games ends. If the owner dies the attack animal
is lost.


Mark of Chaos: Few who travel to Mordheim do so with good intentions,
indeed many see the calamitous destruction of Sigmar's followers as a 
sign that the site is clearly of great interest to the Chaos Gods.
Eager to prove themselves to their new masters they may
dedicate themselves to their worship.

Heroes from a Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (other than
Skaven and undead) may immediately choose one Mark of Chaos. Due to the
brashness, arrogance, boastfulness, and self-importance instilled 
universally upon any Chaos worshipper who recieves a visible gift of their
patron god each Mark taken in this way will add an upkeep cost of 5 gold
per game. If the leader has any other mark then Undivided all heroes must 
have the same mark.

Medical Knowledge: If you have a warrior in your warband with
this skill you may re-roll a result on the Serious Injury table. If the
model with this skill is not taken out of action.

Musician: Musicians are important to a warband both during and
after a battle. They can sing and tell tales to raise extra income, sing
songs of valour during battle to embolden the troops, and rally the
troops when things look bad.
Warrior with this skill can choose skills from the Musicians Skills
list. Only one model per warband may have this skill, and Musicians 
recruited from the Warhammer books automatically have it.
Mob Mentality: If a model with this skill is within 3”
of at least three other models from his warband, then he gives all of
the models in that area, including himself, immunity to fear and +1
Initiative. If the model, with Mob Mentality, is taken out of action
while giving bonuses, then all models who are benefiting from the
effects will automatically fail an “All alone check” and move
accordingly.
Money Maker: The model with this skill utilizes his
talents and wares to try and make extra money after the adventure. If
the model is not taken out of action, they may roll an additional die
during the exploration phase. There may not be more than one character
with the Money Maker skill in your warband. There's just not enough money!
Ride: This skill is vital if a rider wishes to ride an
animal into combat. Taking this skill once will allow a Warrior to ride any
War Beast class mount. Taking this skill twice will allow a Warrior to ride any
Monstrous Mount. Taking this skill a third time will allow a Warrior to
ride Monsters. The mount options available to each Warrior must be appropriate
to their race however, so an Orc could not ride a Wolf (as Wolves are for Goblins!)
Warriors with this skill can choose skills from the Cavalry Skills list

Sneaky: All enemy models halve their Initiative range when trying
to detect this model while he is Hidden.


#### Combat Skills

Strike to Injure: The warrior can land his blows with uncanny
accuracy. Add +1 to all injury rolls caused by the model in hand-to-
hand combat.

Combat Master: The warrior is able to take on several opponents at
once. If he fights against more than one enemy at a time, he gains an
extra Attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase as long as he is
fighting two or more enemy models. In addition, the warrior is
immune to ‘All Alone’ tests.

Weapons Training: A warrior with this skill is adept at using many
different weapons. He may use any hand-to-hand combat weapon he
comes across, not just those in his equipment options.

Flashy Fighting: Few can match the ability of this warrior. He fights
with great skill and flair, weaving a web of steel around him. The model
gains +2 to all his rolls on Critical Hit tables in hand-to-hand
combat.

Expert Swordsman: This warrior has been expertly taught in the
art of swordsmanship. He may re-roll all missed attacks if he is
using a sword in the hand-to-hand phase of the turn that he charges.
Note that this only applies when they are armed with normal swords
or weeping blades, and not with double-handed swords or any other
weapons.

Step Aside: The warrior has a natural ability to avoid injury in
combat. The warrior gains a 5+ Ward Save against wounds inflicted by
hand-to-hand combat.

Axe Master: The warrior may parry with normal axes as per normal
parrying rules.

Disarm: The warrior may opt to forego his normal attacks and
attempt to disarm a single opponent. To disarm the opponent, the
warrior must declare what weapon he is disarming and then roll to
hit the foe at a -2 WS for a single handed weapon and a -3 WS for a
2 handed weapon. If successful the opponent must fight without the
designated weapon until he recovers it. The foe recovers his weapon
in the first Recovery Phase out of Hand-to-Hand. Not vs. natural
weaponry such as teeth/claws etc.

Expert Axeman: A Warrior with this skill may re-roll any failed to-hit
rolls with single-handed axes in the combat phase of the turn he charges.

Finishing Move: The warrior may opt to forgo his usual number of
attacks and make a single attack at an additional +2 Strength to its
normal strength. This can be used in conjunction with Mighty Blow,
Weapon Bonuses, and any other Strength enhancing abilities. The
blow is resolved last AFTER 2 Handed Weapons. Useful for taking
out Knocked Down models with high Toughness.

Follow-Through: If a Warrior manages to take all of their opponents
Out of Action in the same combat phase in which they charged they may
immediately make an additional 2" movement. This move may bring them 
into base contact with another model in which case they are considering
as having charged them too and will immediately fight in that turn's
combat. A Warrior may not Follow-Through more than once per turn, and
will be at -1 Strength for that combat phase (including for the purposes
of Impact Hits, also applying to their mount if they have one). 

Pugilist: The warrior may treat their bare fists as clubs. They will
never count as being Unarmed, and will count as being equipped with
clubs equal to their number of arms. Yes, you can be a mutant Pugilist
who boxes with their extra tentacles and crab hand.

Shield Smash: The warrior has trained to integrate his shield into
his fighting style. When using a Shield or Buckler in Hand-to-Hand
he may make a single additional attack resolved at the warriors
Strength. The Shield Smash cannot cause critical hits. 

Sweeping Blow: The warrior may opt to make a single sweep attack
against all the models in base to base contact with him instead of
making his normal attacks. Rather than rolling to hit, each foe must
take an Initiative test to avoid the blow. Each model failing their
test is hit, and the warrior rolls to wound each enemy
independently as normal. This maneuver can only be executed with
a two-handed weapon (including halberds and flails, etc.), but no
Strength bonuses granted by the weapons themselves are included.

Whip Master: The hero has mastered the brown hat, and may re-roll
all failed to-hit rolls with Whipcrack. Additionally enemies must 
re-roll any successful armour saves made from the Whipcrack attack.
Note that this does not benefit the hero's regular attacks.

#### Shooting Skills

Quick Shot: The warrior may shoot twice per turn with a bow or
crossbow (but not a crossbow pistol).

Pistolier: The warrior is an expert at using all kinds of pistols. If he
is equipped with a brace of pistols of any type (including crossbow

normal reloading rules apply). If he has a single pistol then he may
fire it in the same turn it was reloaded.

Eagle Eyes: The warrior’s sight is exceptionally keen. He adds +6"
to the range of any missile weapon he is using.

cannot be combined with the Quick Shot skill. This does not apply to
War Machines.

Trick Shooter: The warrior can shoot through the tiniest gap
without it affecting his aim. He ignores all modifiers for cover when
using missile weapons.

Action Hero: Ammunition somehow doesn't appear to be a problem for this
hero! The Warrior never needs to reload their weapons.

Knife-Fighter: The warrior is an unrivalled expert at using lightweight
throwing weapons. They can throw a maximum of three of these missiles in 
their shooting phase and may divide their shots between any targets 
within range as they wish. This only works with generic throwing weapons,
not Throwing Axes or Javellins for example.

Vitals Shot: The warrior is adept at shooting where it hurts the
most. He adds +1 to rolls on the Critical Wound effect chart when
using ranged attacks.

Fletcher: The warrior makes his own arrows. When shooting a bow,
his arrows are +1 to rolls on the Injury Chart.

draw. All attacks made by the warrior with a bow are at +1 Strength.

The mental powers of the wizard allow him to wear armor
and cast spells.

Scribe: The warrior is a natural adept at writing and making scrolls.
Any warrior with the ability to cast spells or use prayers may take
this skill. It allows them to make a scroll before the battle and
inscribe a single spell or prayer upon it that they are versed in. The
scroll may be used just before they are about to cast the spell or
prayer and allows the caster +2 to his difficulty roll. Once used the
scroll will crumble to dust and is useless. Scrolls may not be saved
up from battle to battle if they are not used.

Mind Focus: The warrior possesses a great strength of mind which
allows him to concentrate beyond the levels of most normal men.

positions for his warriors to meet the oncoming attack. In any scenario
the player may deploy their Warband 4" further onto the board than usual.

warrior has an uncanny knack of placing their men in the right place
at the right time, as if they sense danger through instinct alone. The warband

in any building on the board that is atleast 12 inch away from an enemy 
model and not in the enemy deployment zone.

Magical Aptitude: This skill may only be taken by a Magic User. It
may not be used by pray-users. The warrior has a keep aptitude for
magic and can push themself beyond normal limits to produce a
storm of spells, allowing them to cast twice per turn. After attempting the
first spell, they must take a toughness test. If they pass they may attempt
a second spell that turn or even cast the same spell twice. If they fail

#### Strength Skills

Mighty Blow: The warrior knows how to use his strength to
maximum effect and has a +1 Strength bonus in close combat. 

Pit Fighter: The warrior has learned how to fight in enclosed spaces
from their time in the dangerous fighting pits of the Empire. They are an
expert at fighting in confined areas and adds +1WS and +1A Attacks if they
are fighting inside buildings or ruins. It’s a good idea
to define which bits of your terrain collection count as ‘buildings or
ruins’ at the start of a battle to avoid confusion later.

against attacks made in close combat. Does not effect being shot with pistols.

causes fear in opposing models.

without suffering Movement penalties.

Beastmaster: If the model confronts an animal (not mount!) in hand-to- 
hand combat, then before combat is fought they may take a Ld test. If the
test is successful then the animal falls under their command. The animal then
come under control of the Beastmaster's warband. Control of the animal is immediately
lost if the Beastmaster either moves more than 8" away ir is _incapacitated_.
#### Speed Skills

Leap: The warrior may leap D6" in the movement phase in addition
to his normal movement. He may move and leap, run and leap, or
charge and leap, but he can only leap once per turn.
A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models,
including enemies, and obstacles 1" high, without penalty.
The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you
must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice
to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he
falls through the gap (see page 6).

Sprint: The warrior may triple his Movement rate when he runs or
charges, rather than doubling it as normal.
Acrobat: The warrior is incredibly supple and agile. He may fall or
jump from a height of up to 12" without taking any damage if he
passes a single Initiative test, and can re-roll failed Diving Charge
rolls. 

Lightning Reflexes: The Warrior negates the 'strikes first' bonus of
any model that charges them.

Jump Up: The warrior can regain his footing in an instant,
springing to his feet immediately if he is Knocked Down. The

unless he is Knocked Down because of a successful save from
wearing a helmet or because he has the No Pain special rule.

highest wall or fence with ease. They no longer require Initiative tests
for climbing. (Jumping down still requires them).

charging in to Hand-to-Hand combat.

Fleet Footed: The warrior gains +1 to his base Movement.



#### Assassin Special Skills

Backstabber: The assassin specializes in attacking his targets when
their back is turned. If The Assassin charges a foe from outside of line
of sight (therefore needing an Initiative Test to do so) they surprise their opponent
and receive a +1 to hit with all attacks and any Injury Rolls are at +1.
This bonus lasts for the first round of combat only, as their opponent will 
swiftly recover their wits if they survive the initial assault.

Silent Takedown: If an Assassin manages to _incapacitate_ a target within the same
round of combat as they charged it they may make an immediate free movement of up to
2". Assuming this movement would put them into a position to do so, they may then
go into hiding. This move may not take them into combat with a new enemy.

Opportunistic Killer: An assassin's preferred foe is an oblivious one. If an
assassin completes a diving charge against an unengaged foe they gain the 
_Killing Blow_ special rule for that round of combat.

Master of Poisons: The assassin is a master in brewing up different
poisons. If the hero does not search for rare items, they may
brew up D3-1 portions of either dark venom or black lotus. It may come up
empty, but those are the hazards of trying these intricate things
on the move. The portions are large enough for one weapon and
need to be used for the next battle as they are less stable then
normally purchased poisons.

Master of Disguise: Paranoia is rewarded in Mordheim, and warriors quickly
learn to watch the shadows and remember to look up. In the chaos of a skirmish
innovative thinking can even turn a direct assault into a surprise! Before the 
start of a game the Assassin's owner may choose to have the Assassin replace a
henchman in either their own or a Formal Ally's warbands. Secretly make a note
of which henchman has been replaced. The disguised assassin gains the equipment 
and stats of that henchman until they are revealed. An assassin is automatically 
revealed if they are charged, or they be revealed at the start of their owning
player's turn. Once an assassin is revealed they immediately recover their own gear 
and behave as normal. Assassins may not disguise themselves as Monstrous Infantry,
no amount of low-brimmed hats and hunching will make an Elf look like a convincing Ogre.

Hitman: The Assassin is a master of acting natural and hiding in plain 
sight, allowing them to go into Hiding even if in the open and in line of sight of
an enemy. This ability ceases to work for the rest of the battle if the
assassin attacks an enemy or attempts to pick up loot.

Infiltration: The Assassin with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.

armor, deflecting sword strokes and protecting him from harm. The
model gains a 6+ Armor Save that can be combined with other
armor as normal.

Fearless: Immune to Fear and All Alone tests.
Giant Horns: The Beastman gains Impact Hits (1)

will not have to test for Infighting.

from terrible diseases and decay, which are known as Blessings of
Nurgle.

rolls a natural 6 on the to-hit roll, he automatically wounds his

the peasants and chaff. Only heroes are worth his time! The vampire

enemies armed with shooting weapons.
Virtue of the Impetuous: The Knight gains an additional +D3" to
his move when charging. Roll the dice each time you wish to charge

#### Cavalry Skills


Cavalry Commander. Mounted heroes are an impressive sight.
With a good vantage point, they can see (and be seen) far more
readily than if they were on foot. If the warband's leader has this
skill and is mounted, he may add an extra 6" to the distance within
which other warriors in the warband may use his Leadership. This is
in addition to any other bonuses that increase the range of the
leader’s influence.
Trick Riding. By athletically hanging off the side of his mount, a
rider makes himself harder to hit. While a rider is trick riding all
missile attacks against him suffer -1 to hit in addition to other
modifiers. The rider must declare that he is trick riding before
moving. He must then make an initiative test and if successful may
move full distance. If he fails he loses control of his mount and must
roll immediately on the Whoa Boy! Table. 
Combat Riding. The rider has trained his mount to use its bulk to
trample any unmounted enemy before him. The mount of a warrior with
this skill gains Impact Hits (1) against Infantry, Swarms, and War Beasts.
Evade. The rider has trained his mount to swerve from side to side
in combat, wrong footing his opponent. A rider with this skill
always strikes first in close combat against dismounted opponents.
When charged by an opponent, or otherwise fighting an enemy also
entitled to strike first, attacks are carried out in order of Initiative. If
Initiative is equal, the model with greater experience strikes first.
Running Dismount. The rider is able to dismount from his mount
at speed. The rider may ride up to the mount’s normal move
distance and then dismount immediately. No further movement or
shooting is possible. This skill may be used to move into contact
with the enemy, counting as a Diving Charge from a height of 2" –
all usual rules for diving charges apply. Note that the rider then
counts as dismounted, gaining no further assistance from his mount.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.
Athletic Mount. Without breaking stride, the warrior is able to leap
onto the back of his mount and immediately spur it into a full gallop.
Once the warrior is aboard, the mount may make a run or charge
move as normal. The warrior must be within 2" of his steed to use
this skill.
Mounted Combat Master. The rider is especially skilled at combat
against a mounted opponent. The model may re-roll failed 'to hit' rolls
in combat against mounted opponents.

#### Clan Eshin Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Art of Silent Death: The Skaven has patiently mastered the deadly
art of open-hand fighting, as taught by the mystics of Cathay in the
temples of the far East. In hand-to-hand combat, the Skaven can
fight with his bare paws without any penalties and counts as having
two weapons (i.e., +1 attack). In addition, a Skaven Hero with this
skill will cause a critical hit on a To Wound roll of 5-6 instead of
just 6. This skill may be used in conjunction with the Eshin Fighting
Claws (+2 Attacks instead of +1).
Play Dead: Sometimes strange things happen when people have the
misfortune of running into Skaven. A clearly dead corpse is not
there anymore after the fight is over, or dropped weapons or
treasures have disappeared. As well as being taught to roll with the
blows, these characters are taught to feign death. When avoiding the
full effects of a potentially lethal blow they play dead so they can
escape undetected later. The character may re-roll a result on the
serious injury table.

Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may

battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Beast Master: Any animals (giant rats, rat wolves, and rat ogres) in
the same warband as the Skaven with this skill are treated as having
a +1 bonus to their Leadership.

#### Clan Pestilens Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Censer Bearer: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Black
Hunger special skill may choose the Censer Bearer special skill. A
Clan Pestilens member with this skill is called Censer Bearer. He
gains the special rule Frenzy and the only weapon he may use in
close combat is a censer.
Contagious: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Rotten Body
special skill may choose the Contagious special skill. A model who
inflicts an injury in close combat that send the contagious member
of the Clan Pestilens out of combat must take a Toughness test. Roll
a D6. If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking
the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always
inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this
test.
Diseased Visage: The follower of the Plagued Ones with this
attribute has obtained a body and face covered in oozing sores and
legions so horrible, that the model causes fear.
Ignore Pain: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Resilient
strength skill may choose the Ignore Pain special skill. A Clan
Pestilens member with this skill treats "Stunned" injuries as
"Knocked Down".
Rotten Body: A Clan Pestilens member with this skill has grown
accustomed to poisons, diseases and the fog of death emanated by
censers. He is now immune to poisons and diseases and, if taken out
of combat because of a failed test for wielding a censer, he will not
have to roll for injuries at the end of the battle, recovering
automatically.
Unholy Chant: Once per battle, the model with this skill may start
an Unholy Chant. This chant causes all Skaven in the warband to
immediately pass all Leadership-based tests in the turn the chant is
uttered, including Rout tests.

#### Clan Skryre Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Excellent Engineer: The Skryre Engineer with this skill is
constantly working on the black powder and Warplock weapons of
the warband. Any black powder or Warplock weapons owned by the
Skaven in the warband have their range increased by +6”.
Warp Magic (magic user only): The Skaven may now uses magic
from the any Skaven magic list or Lesser Magic List.

#### Dark Elf Special Skills

Draich Master: The hero has chosen the aspect of the Executioner
as his primary focus. The hero can wield a double-handed sword
without the usual penalty of striking last, and is allowed to wear
Heavy or Ithilmar armor (note that he may not wear Gromril
armor; what kind of Elf would wear Dwarf-made armor,
anyways?). [Skill by Julian Hellstrom]
Fey Quickness: Few can ever hope to match an Elf ’s inhuman
quickness and agility. An Elf with Fey Quickness can avoid melee
or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the Elf also has Step Aside or
Dodge this will increase to a 4+ in the relevant area. For example,
an Elf with Fey Quickness and Step Aside avoids melee attacks on a
4+ and missile attacks on a 6.
Infiltration: The Dark Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Master of Poisons: The Dark Elf is proficient in concocting
different poisons. If the Hero doesn’t search for rare items, he may
make D3-1 doses of Dark Venom instead. There is a chance of
getting none, as the hero doesn’t have access to a stable workplace.
The poison must be used in the next battle and cannot be sold or
traded to other warbands as the Dark Elves guard their secrets very
carefully.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf and is
capable of feats of strength. A warrior with this skill may choose
skills from the Strength table. The Sorceress may never take this
skill and no more than two warriors in the warband may take this
skill at any one time.
Murderer: The Dark Elf may always choose to attack _incapacitated_ 
foes even if there are standing foes in combat with them.


#### Dwarf Special Skills

Master of Blades: This Dwarf’s martial skills surpass those of a
normal warrior; he has fought unscathed against hordes of Orcs and
Goblins. When using a weapon that has a Parry special rule, this
hero parries successfully if he beats or matches his opponents
highest ‘to hit’ roll, not just if he beats the roll. In addition, if this
warrior is using two weapons that have the Parry special rule, he is
allowed to parry two attacks (if his two dice match or beat the two
highest Attack dice against him) instead of the normal maximum of
one. Note that if this Dwarf has two Dwarf axes (as detailed above)
he can re-roll any failed parries.
Extra Tough: This Dwarf is notorious for walking away from
wounds that would kill a lesser being. When rolling on the Heroes
Serious Injury chart for this Hero after a game in which he has been
taken Out Of Action, the dice may be re-rolled once. The result of
this second dice roll must be accepted, even if it is a worse result.
Resource Hunter: This Dwarf is especially good at locating
valuable resources. When rolling on the Exploration chart at the end
of a game, the Hero may modify one dice roll by +1/-1.
True Grit: Dwarfs are hardy individuals and this Hero is hardy
even for a Dwarf! When rolling on the Injury table for this Hero, a
roll of 1-3 is treated as Knocked Down, 4-5 as Stunned, and 6 as Out
Of Action.
Thick Skull: The Hero has a thick skull, even for a Dwarf. He has a
3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made, treat a
Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Dwarf also wears a
helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of the
normal Helmet special rule).


#### Halfling Special Skills

Quiet as a Mouse: The Halfling as adept at staying as quiet as a
mouse whilst hiding. Enemy warriors must use half their initiative
value in inches (rounded down) when trying to detect this hidden
Halfling.
Crude Belch: Having eaten a meal or six, this Halfling may release
a withering belch to distract his enemies. During the first round of
hand to hand combat the Halfling can release his noxious fumes
upon all enemies within base contact. All enemies affected must
take a leadership test. If the leadership test is failed then the putrid
odour has severely affected the warrior's fighting ability and he must
miss his first attack (regardless of whether he has only one attack or
not).
Skilled Huntsman: The Halfling has been hunting things ever since
he was young (the more food he has, the better!) and has become
well adapted to firing as silently and discreetly as possible. To
represent this a Halfling may try and fire a ranged weapon and
remain hidden. When shooting from hiding roll D6. On a 3+ the
Halfling has managed to keep his actions inconspicuous to the eye
of the enemy and may remain hidden that turn. Note this skill may
not be combined with black powder weapons, they are just too
noisy!
Layers of Fat: The Halfling has gained mountains of flab during his
vast experience of eating fine foods and his thick bulk could
swallow a sword whole! The Halfling always has a basic saving
throw of 6 regardless of the enemy warrior's strength and on top of
any armor he already wears.
Shifty: The Halfling has long-been skirting in the shadows,
avoiding unwanted attention. So nimble is he that he may surprise
even those who believe they've got them dead-to-rights. The
Halfling gains a bonus attack when charged that strikes first.
Wily Thief: If the Halfling takes any enemy out of action and
doesn’t go out of action himself, the warband gains an extra piece of
Wyrdstone (in addition to his Cutpurse piece. See Halfling thief)
Stealthy: The Halfling can hide even after running, and can run
while within 8” of the enemy.

#### Hobgoblin Special Skills

Charge Stoppa: A hobgoblin with this skill can deliver a huge
surprise to a charging opponent. When an opponent charges the
hobgoblin he can immediately make a free attack with a missile
weapon. If the hobgoblin’s strike causes him an injury, the attacker
is stopped halfway through his charge. For example, if the charge
would have been 8”, the hobgoblin’s strike would stop the attacker
at 4 inches. Unfortunately for the hobgoblin, if his assailant does
succeed in his charge, the hobgoblin cannot use hand-to-hand
combat weapons during that round. He can use his fist however.
Ded Shooty: Hobgoblins are famed masters of the bow, and their
steady aim allows them to fire with uncanny accuracy while on the
move. This skill allows a hobgoblin to ignore movement penalties
when shooting. Hobgoblins riding giant wolves can use this skill as
well, suffering no penalties to movement while firing from
wolfback.
Ded Sneaky: These sneaky hobgoblins have been trained as scouts,
sneaking up close to the enemy to deliver a deadly strike or observe
the enemy positions for their leaders. A hobgoblin with this skill is
placed after all other models have been placed. He can be placed
anywhere on the table, as long as he’s at least 12” from any
opponent’s models.
Backstabba: The hobgoblins are a tricky breed, and take advantage
of any opportunity in combat. A hobgoblin with this skill can make
a surprise attack on his opponent from a direction he isn’t expecting.
The attack is in addition to the hobgoblin’s normal attacks, but
cannot be parried.

#### Kislev Ranger Skills

Animal Call: If hidden, the Ranger may use animal calls to
confound the enemies. Any enemy model that is within 18” of the
Ranger and does not declare a charge in its movement phase must
take a Leadership test (determine which models these are after
charges are declared but before they are moved). Those that fail the
Ranger may move in any direction she wishes instead of their
normal move.
Herb Lore: The Ranger has learned basic herb lore to cure injuries.
Any friendly model in base-to-base contact with her may have 1
wound restored on a roll of 4+ in the recovery phase. The ranger
may also heal herself. If any healing is successful, the ranger may
not move this turn, but may shoot as normal. The ranger may not
heal if she is in close combat.

#### Lahmia Special Skills

Swift: when moving the vampire may run but counts as having
moved normally for all purposes.
Transfix: at the start of the combat phase, one enemy model in base
contact must test against Leadership. If the test is failed, the model
may not attack that turn and all attacks against it gain an additional
+1 to hit. Ineffective against models immune to psychology.
Quickblood: the vampire's lightning reflexes give it an
unmodifiable 6+ save against all wounds. This save is in addition to
and taken before normal armor saves. Note that in the case of
critical hits this save is taken before rolling to see if multiple
wounds are taken. If the vampire acquires Dodge or Step Aside,
those skills supercede this one and cannot be combined to produce a
4+ save. Hence, a vampire with Quickblood and Dodge has a 5+
save against missiles and 6+ against close combat.
Innocence Lost: the vampire's ability to appear virginal and
innocent temporarily disarms her opponent. The vampire always
attacks first in close combat. If an enemy model also has the ability
to attack first, then decide in order of initiative. In case of equal
initiative, the highest score on 1d6 goes first. This skill is ineffective
against models immune to psychology.
Seduction: The vampire must test against Leadership at the start of
the combat phase. If successful, one enemy model in base contact
must also save against Leadership. If failed, the model is controlled
by the vampire player. The model's original owner may attempt to
regain control in each subsequent turn by testing again in his
recovery phase. If the vampire chooses to attack the controlled
model, control is lost immediately. If the model ends the game
under vampire control, they count as out of action. A maximum of
one model may be so controlled. Ineffective against models immune
to psychology.
Night Creature: the vampire blends effortlessly into the
background. Models wishing to charge, shoot or cast spells at the
vampire must roll 4+ to do so, or choose another target. This skill is
only effective if the vampire did not move in its previous movement
phase.


#### Marks of Chaos

Mark of Chaos Undivided: Models with the Mark of Chaos Undivided
gain +1 Leadership. This may take them above 10.

Mark of Khorne: Heroes bearing the Mark of Khorne gain Frenzy, and a 5+
ward save against the effects of spells. A Warband containing one or more
of this mark may never form Formal Alliances.

Mark of Nurgle: The Model gains +1 Toughness, +1 Wound, but loses
1 point of Movement and 1 point of Initiative. They are now 
immune to poison and the effects of Plague Victims. These bonuses also
apply to any War Beast or Monstrous Mount the rider may have, though 
it will lose 2 points of movement rather than 1 as it has to contend with
its own decrepitude as well as the increased weight of its rider.

Mark of Slaanesh: Enemy models that wish to charge a character with the
Mark of Slaanesh must first pass a successful Leadership test or 
the charge is failed. Enemies are additionally at -1 to hit in melee.
The character gains Stupidity.

Mark of Tzeentch: The hero immediately learns all spells from Chaos
Rituals and may cast spells in armour. Any roll of a double will miscast.

#### Musicians Skills


Minstrel: The musician is a masterful taleteller and gains extra
income for the warband. If the Musician was not taken out of action they
may earn an additional 2d6 gold after the game.

Fighting Songs: The musician has in his selection of songs many a
fighting ballad. These ballads dispel fear. Any musician with this
ability sings in battle emboldening the troops. Any friendly troop
within 12” does not suffer from fear or all alone tests.

Rally!: Even the most crestfallen Warriors will take heart when gathered
around a motivated and uplifting bard. For every allied Warrior whose
loss would contribute to rout theshold within 6" of the Musician with
Rally the owning player may add +1 to their warband's leadership for
the purposes of rout tests.

Marching Tune: If the Musician forms a unit with five or more allies they
may all add 1 to their base movement as long as they stay together. 

Deafening racket: A musician may choose to make a deafening racket in
each of their shooting phases. If they choose to do so then until their
next shooting phase (so yes, this may even cause the musician's warband to
be more likely to rout) all non-Musicians within 8" reduce their Leadership 
by 1.



#### Mutations

Those who dwell in Mordheim soon develop horrible mutations, and
the Cult of the Possessed seem to be especially susceptible. In
addition, Mordheim attracts mutants from all over the Empire, who
are always quick to join the Chaos covens. Most mutations are
simply inconvenient or hideous, but some make their bearers
extremely dangerous in combat.
Mutations may be bought for a Mutant or a Possessed warrior only
when they are recruited; you may not buy new mutations for a
model after recruitment. Any Mutant or Possessed may have one or
more mutations. The first mutation is bought at the price indicated,
but second and subsequent mutations bought for the same model
cost double.
Daemon soul: A Daemon lives within the mutant’s soul. This gives
him a 4+ save against the effects of spells or prayers.
Cost: 20 gold crowns.
Great claw: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
Cost: 50 gold crowns.
Cloven hoofs: The warrior gains +1 Movement.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Tentacle: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical hits)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
Cost: 30 gold crowns
Spines: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Scorpion tail: The mutant has a long barbed tail with a venomed
tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each hand-to-
hand combat phase. If the model hit by the tail is immune to poison,
the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Extra arm: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in the
extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or a buckler in the extra
arm. If a Possessed chooses to do this, he gains an extra attack but
still cannot carry a weapon.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Hideous: The mutant causes fear. See the Psychology section for
details.
Cost: 40 gold crowns


#### Norse Special Skill

Shield Master: Norse warriors begin training with shields when
they are still children. Some warriors become so skilled with these
weapons that they can block almost any blow against them. When
this hero is armed with a shield he may parry with it in addition to
getting a 6+ save.
Berserk Charge: The Norse are very skilled with weapons that
many other races see as primitive and savage. When this hero is
armed with an axe or double handed weapon, he may re-roll all
failed to hit rolls when he charges.
Crushing Blow: Norse warriors train in almost all of their spare
time. They are expert fighters and learn to put all of their strength
into very powerful attacks. No enemy may parry an attack made by
this hero because it strikes with such power that it pushes right
through a buckler or sword.
Battle Tongue: Only a hero with the leader skill may gain this skill.
It allows models within 12" of him use his leadership, rather than
the normal 6".
Barbarian Courage: As Norse warriors strive to die bravely in
battle, they learn to fear nothing and embrace hardship. This hero
never needs to take all alone tests and may re-roll failed fear tests.

#### Orcs Special Skills

’ard ead: The warrior has a thick skull even for an Orc. He has a
special 3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made,
treat a Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Orc also
wears a helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of
the normal helmet special rule).
Waaagh!: Orcs are aggressive creatures and some are experts at
bulldozing charges. The warrior may add +D3" to his charge range.
’ere we go!: Orcs often charge even the most fearsome opponents.
The model may ignore Fear and Terror tests when charging.
da cunnin’ plan: Only the Boss may have this skill. The warband
may re-roll any failed Rout tests as long as the Boss is not Out Of
Action.
well ’ard (Greenskin warband only): The Orc has a thick, dark-
green skin, possibly indicating Black Orc blood. Such is the
toughness of the Orc that he may add +1 to any armor saves.
Proven Warrior (Black Orc Warband only): This young warrior
has proven himself worthy of his Black Orc heritage. This skill may
only be taken by a Young’un with the Black Orc blood ability and
25 experience. Once he gains this skill, the model is now considered
a full Black Orc Warrior (yet still retains the title of Young’un). He
follows all the rules for Black Orcs and uses their equipment list and
has access to the same skill lists as a Black Orc.
’eadbasher: Orcs have massive physical strength and some of them
even learn to aim their blows at the heads of their opponents, with
obvious results. Any Knocked Down results which the Orc causes in
hand-to-hand count as Stunned results instead.

#### Ostlanders Special Skills

Bull Rush: This warrior is huge, even by Ostlander standards, and
can use his massive girth to overpower his opponents. When he
charges, this Hero may attempt to knock down his opponent rather
than making his normal attacks. Roll to hit once with a +1 to hit
modifier, though no ‘to wound’ roll is necessary. Instead, if the
warrior hits with this attack, the opposing model is Knocked Down.
(Models with the Bull Rush skill should have a suitably large beer-
belly modeled out of putty whenever possible.)
Foul Odor: Ostlanders are one and all prodigious drinkers and none
too hygienic! This warrior rises head and shoulders above the rest.
After a lifetime of drinking, liquor has little effect on him any
more... not that this stops him from consuming massive quantities!
His unwashed clothes and sweat reek of alcohol and all living
enemies (not Undead or Possessed) are at -1 to hit him in hand-to-
hand combat. In addition, the warrior cannot carry any open flames
(torch, lantern, etc.) and fire attacks made against him are resolved
at +1 Strength as his beer soaked clothing burns readily.
Taunt: After years of baiting opponents into drunken brawls the
Ostlander has learned some of most vile insults in the Empire.
During the shooting phase the warrior may choose to taunt one
enemy instead of shooting with a missile weapon or casting a spell.
The warrior must be able to see the enemy and taunting follows all
the LOS rules for shooting (you must taunt the nearest opponent,
etc.). The player should insult the enemy model in some manner
whenever possible (perhaps his hat looks like a strangled parrot or
his mother was a Bretonnian.). The enemy then takes a Leadership
test. If he passes, nothing happens but if he fails he must spend his
next movement phase trying to get into close combat with the
warrior who taunted him.
Animal Friendship: Having grown up amidst the animals of the
forest this warrior exudes a certain charm to all ‘normal’ animals
(i.e. warhorses, Warhounds, etc.). Animals will never attack him and
up to two War dogs (see Mordheim book, page 54) that the warrior
owns do not count against the maximum number of models in the
Warband.
Blood Oath: The leader of an Ostlander Warband sometimes takes
a Blood Oath never to leave any of his fallen ‘family’ members
behind. Such is his determination to protect his fallen Blood-kin that
it is extremely difficult to cause him to Rout from the field. Only a
Warband’s leader may have this skill, which allows him to re-roll a
single Rout test once per game.


#### Pit Fighters Special Skills

Force of Will: When the Pit Fighter loses his last wound and is
taken OOA, he must roll a D6 equal or under his Toughness, each
following round he has to roll again on his toughness but then with a
-1 modifier for each subsequent round. If he succeeds he gets up and
may continue to fight, when he gets taken Out -of-Action a second
time he’ll be removed as normal.
Arms master: The Pit Fighter may now ignore all ‘difficult to use’
rules for all weapons, this enables him to combine certain types of
weapons, he can combine a Morning Star with buckler, or even a
Morning Star with a Morning Star.
Body Slam: Instead of making a normal charge the Pit Fighter may
attempt to slam his opponent to the ground, he burrows his shoulder
deep into his opponent’s stomach. Instead of making his normal
attacks the Pit fighter may make a single attack resolved as
following: +1Str, +1 to Hit, no weapon bonuses or abilities. Critical
hit on a 5+.
Grizzled Veteran: The Pit Fighter is used to fighting fearsome
monsters and being cornered in the Pit when there's no escape. He
has been close to death so many times that he has made his peace
and the thought of Death no longer bothers him. The Pit Fighter is
immune to all psychology.


#### Sisters of Sigmar Special Skills

Sign of Sigmar: The Sister is favoured by the great god Sigmar.
Possessed or Undead opponents lose their first attack against the
Priestess in the first round of hand-to-hand combat (down to a
minimum of 1).
Protection of Sigmar: The Sister has been blessed by the High
Matriarch. Any spell which would affect her is nullified on a D6 roll
of 4+. Note that if the spell is nullified it will not affect any other
models either.
Utter Determination: Only the Matriarch may have this skill,
which allows her to re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Righteous Fury: The Sister feels cold fury and utter contempt
towards any evil that pollutes the soil of the holy Empire with its
presence. The model hates all Skaven, Undead or Possessed
warbands and all models in them.
Absolute Faith: The Sister puts her faith in Sigmar, and faces
dangers unflinchingly. She may re-roll any Fear tests and does not
have to test if she is fighting alone against several opponents.

#### Shadow Warrior Special Skills

Infiltration: A Shadow Warrior with this skill is always placed on
the battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed
anywhere on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing
warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both
players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the
lowest roll sets up first.
See in Shadows: The warrior’s senses have become especially keen
from years spent walking the shadows. As long as he has movement
to reach them, the warrior may always roll to charge opponents he
cannot see (instead of the normal 4").
Hide in Shadows: Over time Shadow Warriors have learned how to
freeze in place and remain undetected, even from the heightened
senses of their Dark Elf cousins. An enemy warrior attempting to
detect this warrior when he is Hidden must halve his Initiative
before measuring the distance.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf, and is
capable of feats of strength not often seen among the people of
Ulthuan. A warrior with this skill may choose skills from the
Strength skills table from now on. This skill may not be taken by
Shadow Weavers. There may never be more than two Elves with
this skill in the warband at any one time.
Master of Runes: The Shadow Weaver has learned to harness the
power of the High Elven runes of power (see Elven Runestones,
below) to a degree few mages attain. When using Elven Runestones,
the mage is +1 to his dispel roll. In addition, the mage can inscribe
the weapons and armor of one of his fellow warriors with Elven
runes. One member of the Warband may re-roll a single failed
armor save or Parry roll once per battle. After a single battle, the
runes lose their glamour and must be redone. This skill may only be
taken by Shadow Weavers.


#### Troll Slayer Special Skills

Ferocious Charge: The Slayer may double his attacks on the turn
that he charges. He will suffer a -1 to hit penalty on that turn.
Monster Slayer: The Slayer always wounds any opponent on a roll
of 4+, regardless of Toughness, unless his own Strength (after all
modifiers due to weapon bonuses, etc) would mean that a lower roll
than this is needed.
Berserker: The Slayer may add +1 to his close combat to hit rolls
during the turn which he charges. (may not be used with Ferocious
Charge).
Sweeping strike: The slayer may make get an extra attack for each
enemy model in base contact, if he is engaged by more than 1
model, up to a total of ten attacks.
Tattoos of Grimnir: The Slayer is tattooed by one of the Priests of
Grimnir the Brave, the God of Slayers. The model now has a 6+
ward save. You may take this skill again increased to 5+ and so on,
up to 3+. (The Slayer is then covered in tattoos!).
Fated: The Slayer is destined not to die easily. You may re-roll any
result on the Serious Injury table. The second result stands, even if it
is worse than the first one.

#### Von Carstein Special Skills

Transfixing Glare: The Vampire is able to hypnotize a victim using
his glowing red eyes, the victim will remain passive and wait for the
Vampire to close. The Glare may be used on any living model in
base contact that is not Immune to Psychology. The victim must
pass a Leadership test on a 2D6 or be transfixed. A transfixed model
may not attack in close combat and is treated as being Knocked
Down for purpose of being attacked. Roll for the Glare at the start of
the combat phase.
Mist Form: A Vampire's human form is only one of many and a
few can transform into a thin mist in the recovery phase. While in
this state the Vampire has a move of 2D6" per turn. He may not
attack in close combat, shoot with a missile weapon or cast spells
and he gains no protection from armor. All to hit rolls against the
Vampire need a natural '6' to hit and all to wound rolls need a
natural '6 '. Note that this may not be modified by any bonuses as it
represents the protection of a non-physical form. The Vampire may
reduce the injury roll by -2. If the Vampire is Knocked Down he
immediately reverts to his physical form. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form in any subsequent recovery phase by choice.
Ratswarm Form: Some Vampires hold a sway over nature and they
can transform into animals such as a wolf, a swarm of rats or a giant
bat. A Vampire can change form in the recovery phase regardless of
whether the Vampire is Knocked Down or Stunned but he suffers all
penalties for standing up for example. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form at the start of any subsequent recovery phase.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ratswarm Form 6 3 0 3 3 * * 4 *
While in Ratswarm form the Vampire may not use weapons and
does not receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot with a
missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat without
a penalty for fighting without a weapon. The Vampire should be
represented by a Ratswarm base but treat the Vampire as being the
size of a single rat for moving through alleys or similar small
spaces. The Vampire may move through small holes and gaps that
would allow a single rat-sized creature to pass through and can thus
move through walls as most have a small holes in them.
Bat Form: Many Vampires can transform into giant bats. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as detailed
above.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bat Form 8 3 0 3 2 * * 1 *
Whilst in Bat form the Vampire may fly and ignores movement
penalties, he cannot run as such but may move double distance and a
charge move is also doubled. The Vampire may not use weapons
and does not receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot
with a missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat
without a penalty for fighting without a weapon.
Wolf Form: Many Vampires can transform into Giant Wolves. A

#### Wardancer Skill List

Aerial Fury: Instead of making a normal charge the Wardancer
may use the Aerial Fury skill. If the Wardancer passes an initiative
test he may jump into combat with the same effects as a diving
charge. This attack can be made from ground level and does not
have to be made from a higher position as per normal diving charge
as the Wardancer simply leap up and brings death to his foes from
above.
Blade Master: The Wardancer is a master of the dance and his skill
with his twin blades is legendary. This allows the Wardancer to use
his second blade to re-roll his parry attempt in the same way as a
buckler though still gaining a +1 attack bonus.
I Shall Fight: Who I Please - With this ability the Wardancer may
charge any enemy within range and line of sight regardless of
models intercepting. Opponent’s clumsy attempts to intercept the
Wardancer are easily dodged or even leapt over.
Ritual Trance: The Warrior puts himself into a ritual chance before
the battle begins. The warrior is utterly fearless and has an undying
lust for combat. The warrior is immune to all psychology.

#### Wood Elf Special Skills

Luck. The Wood Elf is blessed by Lileath, the Elven goddess of
luck. Once per game he may re-roll any dice roll he makes (but not
one made by other members of the warband).
Masterful Ricochet: Learning to ricochet arrows is a life's work for
even an Elven archer - but learning to do so within the contorted and
irregular shapes of Athel Loren is a whole new level of mastery. The range
of the Ricochet critical hit effect is increased to 12" and ignores line of
sight.
Fey protection: The flow of the forest of Athel Loren is a bit
stronger in this warrior and offer a degree of protection against the
winds of magic. The Elven warrior receives a Save of 4+ against the
effect of any magic that affects him or her.
Fey Quickness: Few mortal beings can ever hope it match an Elf ́s
quickness and agility. An Elven warrior with this skill can avoid
hand-to-hand combat or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the warrior
also has the Step Aside or Dodge skill this will increase the special
save to 4+ in the relevant area (IE a warrior with Step Aside avoids
hand-to-hand combat attacks on 4+ and missile attacks on 6+).
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Wood Elf, and
is capable of feats of strength not often seen among the Wood Elf. A
warrior with this skill may choose skills from the Strength skill table
from now on, in addition to his other skill tables. There may bever
be more than two Wood Elf with this skill in the warband at any one
time.
Infiltration: A Wood Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12” from any enemy model. The Scout may set up hidden
if you wish. If both players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6
for each, and the lowest roll sets up first.
Asrai Archery: The Wood Elf does not suffer -1 penalty for
moving and shooting.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Hide in Shadow: enemy attempting to detect a Wood Elf with this
skill must halve his inniative
Confused: Gains the Hatred rule of all Forest Spirits.

### Starting the game

#### Pre-battle sequence

Although you can simply decide with your opponent which
scenario you want to play, most players prefer to generate
their scenarios randomly. To do this, work your way through
the following sequence before the battle.
1 The player with the lowest warband rating rolls on the
Scenario table to determine which scenario is played. In the
scenarios where there is an attacker and a defender, the same
player may choose which he is.
2 Roll for warriors with old battle wounds to see whether
they can take part or not.
3 Set up the terrain and warbands according to the rules for
the scenario you are playing. The more buildings the better,
so you should place all the terrain you have.

#### Rules for playing multiplayer games

Size of playing area: Multiplayer Mordheim obviously
requires more room to play. While Mordheim normally plays
fine in a 4'x4' area, the size of the playing area for
multiplayer games should be at least 4'x6'. This is important
for set-up as detailed below.
Attackers and defenders: In scenarios where attackers and
defenders are defined, the defender is the player whose
warband has the highest rating. If more than one warband
have the same highest rating, the defender will be the one
among them whose warband includes the most models. If
there is still a tie, roll a dice to determine who gets to be the
defender. There is only ever one defender, all the other
warbands are the attackers.
Setting up the warbands: In scenarios where there is a
defender, that player sets up his warband first. To determine
who among the attacking warbands sets up next (or among all
the warbands in a scenario without defined attackers and
defenders), each player rolls a D6. The player with the
highest roll sets up next and the remaining players set up in
order of descending dice rolls.

When it is his turn to set up his warband, each player must
choose one segment of table edge (see the diagram above for
what constitutes a ‘segment’) and set up his warband within
6" of it. No player may start a member of his warband within
6" of a member of another warband.
Note that some scenarios will have special set-up rules
(usually for the defender) which are different from the above.
Any such variation will be noted in the rules for that scenario.
Order of play: After all warbands have been set up, players
must determine the order of play. Players should be arrayed
about the table by their set-up segment (see above). Each
player rolls a D6. The player with the highest roll gets the
first turn. Play proceeds clockwise around the table from
there.

Shooting into close combat: Unlike in the regular Mordheim
rules, it is possible to shoot into close combat in multiplayer
games, just as long as the shooters belong to a different
warband than the models involved in the Close Combat. Enemies in
a combat are not considered the closest enemy for the purposes
of being the closest target for shooting, though unless their combat
runs the risk of hitting your own allies you may target them anyway.
Randomise any missile hits between the
target and any models in close combat with him.
Close combat involving multiple warbands: In multiplayer
Mordheim it is quite possible that one warband member gets
charged by models from two or more opposing warbands.
When this occurs, a model will fight during the Close
Combat phase of each model it is fighting. This can give a
model many attacks during a cycle of player turns but any
model that has been ganged up on in this way is probably
done for in any case!
Routing warbands: Unlike normal games of Mordheim, one
warband failing its Rout test (or having all of its models
taken out of action) does not necessarily end the game.
Unless there are special victory conditions noted in the rules
for the scenario you are using, a multiplayer game will last
until there
is only one warband left on the table. The player whose
warband stays on the table for the longest is normally the
winner, though in some scenarios the winner might be the
warband leaving the table first, as it achieves its objective and
leaves the scene!


#### Scenarios

##### Scenario: Defend the Hoard

In this scenario the defending warband has prepared to send an accumulation of Wyrdstone back to their masters. Whether it be for sale in the case of Mercenaries, some bribe to win further favours for Skaven, for returning to the chapel for cleansing in the case of the Sisters of Sigmar~ Warbands will have any number of reasons to need to send resources out of the city to further their goals. The defending warband has spent a great deal of time pooling its resources and gathering wyrdstone to send away for sale, but this movement has attracted unwanted attention. Attacking warbands see an unmissable opportunity here, and must attempt to steal as much wealth as possible before the caravan (and more importantly its reinforcements) arrive.
Terrain
The defending player sets up a Hoard of their own design: They may choose four buildings and up to four walkways with which to build a defensible combination of structures in the middle of the table (or at least as much so is possible). In the middle of this superstructure is the Horde, a vast mountain of wyrdstone ready to be shipped as cargo. The Horde contains D3+1 shards of wyrdstone for each player participating in the scenario, and attacking players may collect a shard of wyrdstone from the Horde in the same way they would gather a normal shard of wyrdstone - collecting one per turn. As usual, animals may not gather wyrdstone. Defenders may not steal their own wyrdstone.
Warbands
The defending player sets up first, then attackers roll a D6 to determine who gets to deploy first, and deploy within 6" of their deployment zone. The defending warband may not form any formal alliances for this battle, and no special deployment rules may be used by any warband.
Starting the game
Attacking warbands roll a D6 and play then proceeds clockwise. The defending player always goes last (and therefore always gets the last play of the game)
Ending the game
The game lasts for 8 turns. If the defending player still has at least one warrior within the Hoard at the end of the 8th turn they then win and claim all the Wyrdstone remaining. If the defending player has no warriors remaining at the end of the game then the attackers win. Attackers may only keep the Wyrdstone they had in their possession at the end of the game - unclaimed Wyrdstone left in the Horde or on the ground will be taken by the caravan the defenders were attempting to sell to (though they will of course recieve no credit, as it was no longer theirs to sell!). If there is only one attacker left before the eighth turn they may continue to play alone until the turn limit is reached to steal as much Wyrdstone as their warband can manage!
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 extra Experience.
+1 Brilliant Defence. If the defending warband won their leader may gain an additional +1 extra Experience as the caravan owners marvel at their fantastic defiance of the odds.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.



##### Scenario: Wyrdstone hunt

Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of
priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon
the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the
spoils.
In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while
scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or
other such potentially rich building.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone
counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are.
There will be D3+1 counters in total.
Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to
see which player goes first. The counters must be placed
more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away
from each other. Note that counters are placed before
deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a
good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table.
Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into
contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table
where he fell.
Warbands
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever
rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of his
choice. His opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite
edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the
first turn.
Ending the game
He game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The
routers automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Your warriors earn one shard of wyrdstone for each counter
still in their possession at the end of the battle.

##### Scenario: Breakthrough

When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating,
warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However,
their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone
for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever scores higher decides
which table edge the attacker sets up on.
The attacker sets up first, within 8" of his table edge. The
defender sets up anywhere on the table as long as all his
warriors are at least 14" away from any attacker.
Starting the game
The attacker has the first turn.
Ending the game
If one of the warbands fails a Rout test, the game ends
immediately and the routing warband loses.
If the attacker manages to move two or more standing
warriors to within 2" of the defender’s table edge, they have
broken through and he wins the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Breaking Through. Any warrior earns +1 Experience for
breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman,
then the whole group gains +1 Experience.



##### Scenario: Street fight

Often two warbands will come face to face with each other in the
narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other
without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed.
Terrain
Set up all the buildings into a single street, with no gaps
along the sides. Behind the buildings are impassable ruins,
although the buildings themselves are still accessible. The
only way out is along the street. The street may be as winding
as you like and should not be too narrow to fight in, but can
have narrow bottlenecks at some points. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 to see who sets up first. Whoever rolls
highest chooses whether to deploy first or second. The
warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.
Special rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the
battlefield via their own edge.
Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands manages to move all its remaining
warriors out of the street via the opposing edge, the game
ends and that player is victorious.
Alternatively a warband which fails a Rout test loses the
game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Escaping. The first Hero from either side (not both!) who
exits via the opposing table edge gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Chance encounter

Both warbands have completed their daily search of the ruins and
are on their way back to their encampment when they run into each
other. Neither side was expecting a fight, and the warband that
reacts the quickest has the advantage.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
1. Each player rolls a D6. The player with the higher score
can choose to deploy first or second.
2. The first player to deploy sets up his entire warband in one
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the first
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone A.
3. The second warband can then be set up in the opposite
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the second
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone B, but
no model may be set up within 14" of any enemy model.
    Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative of their
leader. The player with the higher score goes first.
    Special rules
Each warband is carrying D3 shards of wyrdstone at the
beginning of the battle. Mark down the number each warband
has.
    Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The
routing warband loses.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle then they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
    Wyrdstone
Both warbands gain all the wyrdstone they were carrying at
the beginning of the battle, minus the number of their own
Heroes that were taken out of action during the game, down
to a minimum of zero. In addition, they gain one extra shard
of wyrdstone for each enemy Hero they take out of action, up
to the maximum number of shards the opposing warband was
carrying at the beginning of the battle.


##### Scenario: Hidden treasure

There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed
cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have
heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows
what they will find?
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. His opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.
Special rules
All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know
roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the
buildings to find the treasure. Each time a warrior enters a
building which has not been previously searched by either
side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, he has found the treasure.
Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since
they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each
building may only be searched once.
If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only
one building left to search, the treasure will automatically be
found there. After finding the treasure chest, the warrior must
then take it to safety via his own table edge. Carrying the
treasure chest will slow the warrior carrying it to half speed.
Two or more models may carry the chest without any
penalty. You may use the treasure chest model to represent
the chest. If the carrier is put out of action, place the treasure
chest at the spot where he fell. Any man-sized model may
pick it up by moving into base contact with it.
Whoever recovers the chest may roll on the following chart
after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you
roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns,
which are always automatically found. For example, roll to
see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then
roll to see if you find the armor, and so on. This can make
the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also
mean that your warband has risked death for only three gold
crowns!

ITEMS D6 ROLL REQUIRED
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 pieces of wyrdstone 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Sword 3+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Starting the game
Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband
fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then
gains the treasure chest.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 For Finding the Chest. If a Hero finds the treasure chest
he earns +2 Experience.


##### Scenario: Occupy

This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings
are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and
holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich
pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. The first player chooses
the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all his
warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within 8"
of the opposite edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn.
Special rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the
tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest
to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the
next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of
your standing models is inside and no enemy models are
inside the building.
Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests – as the game lasts for
a maximum of eight turns. If one warband voluntarily routs,
the game ends and the winning warband is considered to
occupy all of the buildings on the table.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives they
gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the warband who controls
the highest number of buildings at the end of the battle gains
+1 Experience.
If both sides occupy the same number of buildings, then the
battle is considered to be a draw and neither leader gains this
bonus.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.



##### Scenario: The Rescue

By Pete Rejowski
There are times when your most experienced Heroes are slain, and
you mourn them greatly; however, it is often worse for them to be
captured by the enemy, as not only will it be likely that you cannot
get them back, but your enemy will also greatly profit from it. As the
basic number of scenarios in the Mordheim rulebook does not
include a Rescue mission, negotiations are the only way to go, and,
to put it simply, there are too many reasons for negotiations to fail
(the leader wants to sacrifice the Hero and gain experience, too
much money to pay for the equipment, the player doesn't ever want
to fight that Hero again, etc). This scenario addresses that flaw and
allows a warband to attempt to regain their lost companion.
If such a situation arises, the warband that had a Hero captured
may opt to play the next scenario as a Rescue Mission; this cannot
be superseded by anything, nor can the warband who captured the
Hero deny the Rescue Mission. But if the mission is failed, the
attacking warband cannot play another Rescue Mission immediately
after, even if the option to choose the scenario comes up in the game
after (or even if he had a different Hero captured!). A warband with
the Mordheim map that allows it to “automatically choose the next
scenario” may instead choose the scenario played after the Rescue
Mission (that is, an attempted rescue does not ruin the potential
gain of the Mordheim map for either player).
Notes: This scenario plays like a combination of Defend the
Find and Surprise Attack combined with the Rescue Mission
from Necromunda. It borrows certain elements from the
Necromunda scenario (namely the movement of the sentries,
as seen below), but plays out a bit differently due to the
altered spotting rules and the lack of loud firearms. Those
who have access to the Necromunda version can easily draw
comparisons between the two, but a few things have changed
to keep it more in line with standard Mordheim scenarios.
Terrain
Each player takes a turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. It is suggested
that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The
first building should be placed in the centre of the table, as
the objective of the scenario (the captured Hero and his gear)
will be placed within.
Set-up
The prisoner and his gear are set up in the central building as
described above. The prisoner may not act until he is freed.
The defender is not allowed to attack or “execute” his
prisoner, but must attempt to drive off the rescuers. Once the
captive is freed, however, he is fair game.
A prisoner is free to move and fight once cut free by a
friendly fighter. The friend moves into base contact with him
and spends the rest of the turn cutting him free; he may not
shoot, cast spells, and fight in hand-to-hand or anything else
at all. Once freed, the prisoner may move and attack
normally. Note that the captive has no weapons or other
equipment until he reclaims his own (or if the friendly fighter
gives him something).
The attacking warband can reclaim the captive's gear by
moving into base contact with the chest. As above, it takes an
entire turn to open the chest. If the model who opens the
chest later comes in contact with the prisoner, he may give
him all of his old gear; however, the prisoner may not put on
any armor, as a quick escape is desired (he may use a shield
as normal).

Warbands
The warband that captured the Hero is automatically the
defender, and sets up his warband as follows:
1) The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and
Henchman group in his warband in any order that he chooses.
On a 1-3, they are elsewhere (patrolling a wider perimeter),
and may turn up if the alarm is sounded (as detailed below).
On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the game. Note that
at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be present at the
start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen group will
automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.
2) The defender deploys his available troops on the table. No
model may be closer than 6” to another model, as the
warband is spread out to keep a careful lookout. No model
may be deployed closer than 8” to a table edge. The defender
also places the captured model anywhere in the center
building, and also places a treasure chest (representing his
gear) in the same building. Note that the defender cannot use
any special set-up rules, such as Infiltration.
3) The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8” of a
random table edge, as shown in the diagram for the Surprise
Attack scenario. He may choose which edge to nominate as
“1” before rolling to see where he deploys. The attacker can
use special set-up rules (such as Infiltration) as normal.
However, the attacker cannot use any mounted figures in this
battle, as they are far too noisy; the mounts will be left at
their encampment.
Starting the game
The attacker always gets the first turn.
Special rules
Sentries: Until the alarm is sounded (see below), the
defender's models are moving about in a somewhat random
pattern, keeping a look out. Each sentry moves d6-3 inches
per turn; roll separately for each model. If the distance is
negative, then the attacking player is allowed to move that
model. After moving each sentry, roll the Scatter dice and
turn the model to face the direction indicated. Models with
Stupidity move like this until the alarm is sounded
(effectively ignoring their Stupidity for now).
Sounding the alarm: Until the alarm is sounded, sentries
move as described above. In addition, their Weapon Skill is
halved (rounding fractions up), and they may not shoot or
cast spells. After the alarm is sounded, the sentries may move
and attack freely. In addition, the defender may be able to
bring on reinforcements as described below. The alarm can
be sounded in a number of ways:
Spotting: Roll 2d6 at the end of the defender's turn; this, plus
an individual model's detection range (the range used to
detect Hidden models; usually their Initiative value), is the
distance at which a model can try to spot the enemy. They
must be within the front 90° arc of the model. This represents
that the swirling fog and lingering smoke that fills Mordheim
is somewhat distracting when an enemy does not clearly
present itself; as well, it shows that the attacker is attempting
to move more stealthily than normal.
Attackers in the open will be spotted on a d6 roll of 2+.
Attackers in cover will be spotted on a d6 roll of 4+.

Attackers out of sight of a sentry and not in their frontal arc,
but within the detection range of the sentry will be “spotted”
(more like heard) on a roll of 6.
Sentries will spot any attacker within their detection range
and their front arc on a 4+, whether the attacker is visible or
not; if such an attacker is visible at all (including if in cover),
this chance increases to a 2+.
Raiders are also spotted if they move within sight of a sentry
during their own turn. The spotting range is as rolled in the
defender's turn, and the same dice rolls are required.
Remember, sentries can only see within their frontal arc until
the alarm is sounded.
If a sentry spots a raider, he sounds the alarm. However, he
can only give the alarm if he survives the attacker's turn. If he
is taken Out of Action, then he cannot sound the alarm.
Shooting: If an attacker shoots a black powder weapon, roll
d6 and add the weapon's Strength to the score. If the result is
over 8, the alarm is sounded. Note that firing a black powder
weapon can sound the alarm even if there are no sentries left.
Fighting: A sentry who is attacked in hand-to-hand combat
will sound the alarm if he survives the turn (even if Knocked
Down or Stunned). Remember that the sentry's Weapon skill
is halved until the alarm is sounded. If the raider shoots a
black powder weapon in hand-to-hand, then you must roll as
described above to see whether the shots sound the alarm
even if the enemy is killed.
In addition, the noise of fighting may cause the alarm to be
sounded even if the sentry doesn't survive to do so himself.
The attacker rolls a d6; if the score is not more than the
number of attackers fighting in the hand-to-hand combat,
then the noise of the scuffle has been noticed and the alarm is
sounded. For example, if three attackers slaughter a single
sentry, then you must roll 4 or more on the d6 for this to go
unnoticed.

Reinforcements
Once the alarm has been sounded, the defender may attempt
to bring on the rest of his warband. For each Hero or
Henchmen group not on the table, roll a d6, and on a 4+, they
move on in the movement phase from a random table edge as
shown in the diagram for Surprise Attack. All reinforcements
for that turn arrive from the same edge and may charge on the
turn in which they arrive.
Ending the game
The game ends if the captive is freed and makes his escape
by moving off any table edge. The game also ends if all the
attackers are taken Out of Action. Due to the high tension and
stress of the situation, neither warband is forced to take Rout
Tests until they have lost half of their warband (instead of the
usual 25%).
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 per enemy Out of Action. A hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts Out of Action.
+1 Escapes. The captured model gains +1 Experience if he
successfully exits the board.
+1 Winning Leader (Attacker). The leader of the attacking
warband gains +1 Experience if victorious.
+2 Winning Leader (Defender). The leader of the defending
warband gains +2 Experience if victorious.
Finial Notes
Note that even if a Rescue Mission is failed, the attacker can
still attempt to negotiate for the release of his Hero. However,
given the fact that he just attacked the rival warband, this will
undoubtedly drive up the price! Of course, it is quite possible
that the attacker could have Captured one of the defender's
models, making a trade viable; also, the attacker will likely
have a bit more money to offer, as he gets a second game
worth of exploration (assuming any of his Heroes survived).


##### Scenario: Race to the Stash

By Jace Proctor
In the aftermath of the comet's fall, Mordheim has become a
labyrinth of ruined buildings, decaying streets, abandoned
catacombs, and treacherous alleyways. Some even say that the city
itself is alive, and has the power to reorder its chaotic innards in
order to confuse or destroy the imposing warbands who plunder the
city for precious wyrdstone. It is not uncommon for a warband to
find a safe haven or a stash of treasure only to find it completely
vanished the next day, replaced by a completely different structure.
It is for this reason that warbands will often assail a place of worth
as quickly as possible, to ensure that they can plunder its riches
before it is never seen again. Sometimes two or more warbands will
hear of the same location at the same time, and in these situations a
deadly race can ensue through the streets of Mordheim, with the
victor claiming lordship over the area and defending it from any
attackers.
Through your network of informants and spies, you have learned of
a large stash of treasure deep within the city's rich quarter, which
once housed the affluent and often corrupt upper class of citizens.
According to your informant, this find has only just been discovered,
and the riches are ripe for the taking! Finds like this are rare, but a
find in the rich quarter is almost unheard of, as this area of the city
is trafficked often by the warbands seeking wyrdstone and riches.
Immediately gathering your warriors and gear, you quickly embark
towards the location of the rumoured find. As you quietly make your
way across the remaining bridge and through the streets of
Mordheim, you catch sight of an opposing warband who is
travelling in the same direction as you. A row of ruined, but still
standing buildings separate you from your rivals, who have also
spotted you. The both of you quicken your pace, and suddenly you
hear the crack of a crossbow bolt whizzing through the air and
striking a wall behind you. Your warband returns fire in kind, still
racing through the mottled, uneven streets of the former rich
quarter. Through the gaps in the buildings you exchange shots,
speeding through the twists and turns of the city, approaching the
stash of treasure at breakneck speed. Whoever is to reach the horde
first will have a marked advantage, as they will be able to take
covered positions and defend the find against the attackers.
This Scenario can be used for both Two Player and
Multiplayer Games.
Terrain
Set up the terrain so that there are two lanes or streets, one for
each warband, with both lanes eventually leading to a
building or other structure that represents the treasure horde.
The lanes should be segregated by a row of buildings or other
such terrain that is impassable on foot, but can be shot
through. These lanes should be as similar as possible with
respect to length and distance from the goal, but do not have
to be perfectly straight or symmetrical. A slightly longer table
or playing area than normal is recommended for this
scenario; something roughly 5' x 2' or larger would do nicely.
Set-up
Roll a D6 for each player. The player with the highest score
can choose which lane he or she wants to set up in. The
opposing player must set up in the other lane. All models
must be deployed within 6” of the closest table edge and
inside the lanes. Because the warbands are racing toward the
goal as fast as possible, no models may be deployed on high
ground at the start of the game. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative value of
their leader. The player with the highest total result goes first.
Special rules
Breakneck Speed: The warbands in this scenario are
navigating their way through the city as fast as possible, and
will not stop until they can see the horde of treasure they are
searching for. All models in this scenario must run the
maximum distance allowed every turn until they are within
line of sight of the goal, at which point they will slow down.
However the warbands are aware of their competition, and
will occasionally shoot toward each other in a desperate
attempt to slow the other band down. Because of this, models
armed with a shooting weapon may shoot while running, with
a -1 “to hit” penalty conferred for doing so. This penalty is
added to any other penalties as normal, such as over half
distance or being behind cover. This penalty will also replace
any “move or shoot” rules that a weapon would normally be
subject to: for example, a model armed with a handgun may
shoot his handgun while moving during this scenario, but will
suffer a -1 to hit for doing so. Reloading rules apply as
normal.
If a model moving at breakneck speed is brought into base-to
-base contact with another model, the model will not count as
charging for purposes of striking first, or gain +1 attack; the
combat will be played out normally using initiative value.
This is to represent the model's reckless speed, which is not
the same as a well-planned charge into combat, which would
allow them to strike first and gain +1 attack.
Models are considered to be moving at breakneck speed only
while they are approaching the goal. Once they have line of
sight to the goal they will not be compelled to move as
quickly or fire as recklessly, and as such the rules for
movement, shooting, etc. will return to normal on their next
turn.
Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Race Winners. All heroes in the warband that reaches the
stash of treasure first gain +1 Experience


Rewards
The winning warband may plunder the treasure horde after
the battle, keeping anything it finds. Roll a D6 for each item
on the following table, with the exception of the gold crowns,
which the warband always finds.
D6 Result
1 4D6 + 10 gold crowns.
2 A plain brown chest containing D3 helmets.
3 A small, unmarked, black chest containing D3 vials of poison.
You may choose whichever poison you wish, and may choose
more than one type of poison. Each vial is enough for one
application.
4 A worn, well-traveled wooden shipping crate filled with
weapons from far off lands. Roll a D3. On a roll of 1, you
have found a dwarf axe. On a roll of 2, you have found a
Hochland long rifle. On a roll of 3, you have found an elf bow.
Note that you may need the weapons training skill to use these
weapons, but you may sell them for the normal price (half
their retail value).
5 A gallantly decorated military crate, locked and branded with
the royal seal of Bretonnia. Inside you find a knight's lance,
and on a roll of 5+, a suit of gromril armor.
6 An ornately carved and decorated armoire, inside which hangs
a randomly generated magical artifact. Roll on the magical
artefact's table, re-rolling for any artifacts that have already
been discovered during this campaign.



##### Scenario: Happy Harpy Hunting Grounds

By Chris
The ruined buildings of Mordheim are home to many strange and
fantastical creatures, a number of which are the subjects of rumours
about hidden riches. Occasionally warbands will attempt to
discover whether these rumours are true. Most of the time these
adventurers are never seen again, but often enough they return
laden with treasures; often enough, that is, to convince the rest that
it’s worth a try...
A group of three Harpies have nested in one of the tall buildings in
the edge of the ruined city, and their scavenging and attacks on
unfortunate warbands has ensured a sizeable stash of valuables. In
fact, the Harpies have been nesting on some rather sizeable shards
of wyrdstone closely resembling eggs of a sort. Partially due to their
maternal instinct and probably due to the corrupting influence of the
wyrdstone the Harpies have grown extremely protective of their nest
and will guard it to the death if need be.
Terrain
Start by set one of the taller building (6" or taller) in the
centre of the playing area (The top of this is where the
Harpies have built their nest), then each player takes it in turn
to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or
other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within
an area roughly 4' x 4'. Ladders may be placed in nearby
buildings, but none in the building occupied by the Harpies.
Set-up
The scenario is for two warbands and a third player whom
would control the three Harpies.
Special rules
Will not rout: The Harpies have mistaken the wyrdstone in
their nest for Harpy eggs and will fight to the death to protect
them.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest chooses who
sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all his warriors within 8" of that edge. His
opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. If more
warbands are used then uses the Players use the normal
warband setup rules (see ‘Setting up the warbands’) also the
amount of harpies will increase by D3 per warband.
Starting the game
The Harpies go first before any of the warbands.
Ending the game
A warband wins if all three Harpies have been taken out of
action and the other warband has routed, or the Harpies win if
both of the warbands rout before the Harpies have all been
taken out of action.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband(s)
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Roll a D3 to determine how many wyrdstone shards are
included. The nest is also full of various items. The winning
warband may roll on the chart provided to determine what is
contained in the nest.
Harpy Nest Contents
Besides the wyrdstone the following items may be in the
Harpy nest. Roll 1D6 per line. On the number shown, or
better, the item is present.
D6 Item
5+ 2D6gc
3+ Jewelled dagger
5+ Heavy armor
6+ Ithilmir sword
3+ Gems worth 30gc
6+ Wolf cloak
5+ Straggler*
3+ Lucky charm
4+ D3 shields
5+ D3 helmets
6+ D3 swords
* Somehow this unfortunate sod was whisked away to the
Harpy nest. What they had planned for him is unknown, but
he may aid you in your Exploration phase either this game or
next (see pg 217).


##### Scenario: The Lost Prince

By Michael Havener
Travelling entertainers often tell tales of the ruined city and because
of this, sons of the privileged classes often see the city of Mordheim
as one big romantic adventure. Sometimes one will run away from
home to join a mercenary warband and make a name for himself.
Often these individuals are killed before they even get to the city but
once in a while one will get lucky and actually make it that far.
Sometimes their families are happy to see the young fool go but once
in a while, a rich merchant or noble will actually pay to have his
son saved from his inevitable fate in Mordheim.
The warbands have heard rumours that a powerful man’s son has
wandered into the ruins and a handsome reward will be paid for his
return.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
The merchant’s son is initially placed in the centre of the
board. He will wander D6" in a random direction at the start
of each of the first player’s turns, until someone ‘rescues’
him. If a warband member comes into contact with the
merchant’s son (through normal movement, NOT through
charging – this is an exception to the normal rules and
represents that the merchant’s son is not the enemy and
should not be engaged in combat), the boy will attach himself
to that member and follow him around. If the ‘rescuer’ is
taken out of action, flees or routs, the merchant’s son will
attach himself to the next warband member to contact him.
Should someone wish to attack the merchant’s son, he has the
same stats as a Youngblood (see the Mercenary warband in
the Mordheim rulebook) and is armed with a sword and
dagger. If he is killed, no reward will be issued to the
winning warband, of course.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get the
merchant’s son off the table. That warband (and any allied
warband) is the winner.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Reward
The grateful father awards the winning warband with the
following treasure. Note that you roll for each item
separately, apart from gold crowns, which are always
received.
Item D6 Needed
5D6 GC Automatic
D3 swords 4+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Shield 4+
Helmet 4+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+


##### Scenario: The Pool

By Michael Havener
Rumours abound about a pool in the city whose waters have
magical powers of healing. The warband’s patrons believe the
magical properties of the water are due to a large deposit of
wyrdstone within the pool. The warbands have been sent to collect
as much wyrdstone from the pool as they can.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
piece of terrain should be a pool of water roughly 6" in
diameter. The objective of the scenario is to gather all the
wyrdstone from the pool. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario - the pool is too spooky to scout out without backup!
Special Rules
Roll a D3+3 to find out how many pieces of wyrdstone are in
the pool. The pool is shallow and may be entered. Any Hero
spending an entire turn within 1" of the pool doing nothing
else but searching for wyrdstone may roll at the end of his
turn to see if he finds some. On a D6 roll of 1-2, that player
has found one of the pieces in the pool. No Hero may search
within 1" of another model (friendly or enemy), as models
that are too close together disturb the waters for each other,
so that neither may see the bottom. Only as many pieces of
wyrdstone may be found as were rolled at the beginning of
the game, any searching after that is useless. A Hero can
carry any amount of wyrdstone without any penalty. Heroes
cannot transfer their wyrdstone to another warrior. If the
Hero who is carrying a counter is taken out of action, place
the counter on the table again where he fell. Another warrior
can then pick up these counters simply by moving into
contact with them.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’, above).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Ambush!

By Michael Havener
The defending warband has recently discovered a rich deposit of
wyrdstone. Unfortunately, word has leaked out about their find and
warbands throughout the city are hunting them, determined to take
the treasure for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article).
Each of the defending warband’s Heroes carries D3 pieces of
wyrdstone. If a Hero carrying wyrdstone is taken out of
action, place a number of counters, equal to the amount of
wyrdstone he was carrying, on the ground where he fell. Any
Hero moving into contact with them may pick up these
wyrdstone shards.
Warbands
All the models in the defending warband must be set up
within 6" of the centre of the board. The attacking warbands
are then set up as normal.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
Do not roll for Rout tests during this game. Instead, the game
will last 8 turns or until all the wyrdstone shards have been
carried off the board, whichever comes first. The warband
that gets the most wyrdstone shards off the table (or held by
one of its Heroes when the game ends) is considered the
winner. The defending warband may only exit the board via an attacker's deployment zone.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero is carrying a
Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he receives +1
Experience.


##### Scenario: Monster Hunt

The warbands have heard rumours that a terrible monster has come
up out of its lair beneath the city following the recent devastation
and established a new home in the ruins. You have heard stories of
such creatures and the treasure they accumulate is the stuff of
legends. You have decided to see for yourself if the rumours are
true.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
building should be rather large (at least 6" x 6") and open
topped, preferably ruins. This building should be placed in
the centre of the table, and this is where the monster’s new
lair is located.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
The monster’s lair is located in the central building and this is
where the beast will be. The monster is young for one of its
kind and its profile reflects this. In addition, a lifetime of
living in caverns beneath the city has kept the creature from
learning to use its wings. Therefore, unlike most monsters,
this beast cannot fly. The monster will not leave its lair for
any reason, though it will use its breath weapon against any
model in range that it can see and will, of course, attack any
model entering its lair. It will charge all models entering its
lair if possible. Its ‘turn’ is performed before whichever
player won the dice roll to go first, though it will do nothing
until someone comes near its lair. For the monster’s stats, see
‘Great beasts in Mordheim’ over the page.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When one warband (or more than one, if the players have
agreed to share the monster’s hoard) is the only one to have
any models within 6" of the monster’s lair, and the monster
has been put out of action, that warband is victorious and gets
the monster’s hoard. If two or more players have decided to
share the hoard, they must decide how to split it up. If they
cannot determine this peacefully, their warbands will have to
decide it un-peacefully!
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.

Treasure hoard
The young monster has moved its treasure hoard with it to its
new lair. Because of its age, the young monster has not
collected as much treasure as an older creature of its type.
Still, it has amassed a respectable amount. Whichever
warband has control of the monster’s lair at the end of the
game may search it to see what it contains. Note that you roll
for each item separately, apart from gold crowns, which are
always found.
Item D6 Result Needed
5D6 GC Automatic
Magical artefact (roll on artefact table) 6+
D3+1 pieces of wyrdstone 4+
Gromril axe 5+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Suit of light armor 4+
Shield 4+
Helmet 4+
D3 swords 4+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Jewellery worth 10-60 GC 5+
Great beasts in Mordheim
If fewer than 10 games have been played in the campaign then there are D3 monsters +1 for each warband beyond the second. The monster type present is selected at random from the following:
1: Tree Kin
2: Chaos Spawns
3: River Trolls
4: Rat Ogres
5: Dwarf Thanes
6: Ogre Gorger

If more than 10 games have been played in the campaign then one of the following is present, chosen at random:
1: Chimera
2: Chaos Dragon
3: Great Unclean One (level 4 wizard, but only knows Spirit Leech. Will not channel.)
4: Demon Prince
5: Troll King (regular River Troll, but with D3 added to each stat).
6: Verminlord (will attempt to cast Warp Lightning three times every turn. Will automatically miscast on its thirteenth attempt.)



##### Scenario: The Writing on the Wall

By James Burkhouse
The warbands have each heard rumours of a map drawn on an alley
wall on Tyler Street that leads to great treasure! This alley is in the
Poor Quarter, a cluttered and twisting section of the city. Whoever
can decipher the map and keep this precious knowledge from their
enemies will gain a great advantage in the hunt for a fantastic
treasure!
TERRAIN
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. If your terrain
collection allows, a dense warren of narrow, crooked streets
is ideal. In any case, the centre of the table should have two
buildings, placed close together so as to form an alley, one
inch wide. The map will be written in this alley. Because of
the ruins, close confines of the alley, trash, etc., the alley is
considered difficult terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up in
an area roughly 4' x 4'.
WARBANDS
The warband with the lower warband rating chooses whether
to set up first or last. The first player then chooses which
table edge to set up on, and places all of his warriors within
8” of that edge. His opponent then sets up within 8” of the
opposite edge. Because of the dense, mazelike construction
surrounding Tyler Street, skills or abilities which allow
special deployment may not be used.
SPECIAL RULES
The map on the alley wall was written by a madman, and the
warriors in Mordheim will have a tough time puzzling it out
in the middle of a fight! In order to understand the map, a
hero must be moved into the middle of the alley, and must
spend two full turns doing nothing but studying the writing.
Heroes who have taken at least one Academic skill may
decipher the writing in one turn rather than two.
Once a warband has no further use for the map, they may ruin
the wall so other warbands can't follow the directions to the
treasure! The wall has 1 Wound, and a Toughness of 7.
Attacks against the wall automatically hit, and any wound
ruins the map. Anyone attacking the wall must be in the alley
(they cannot ruin the map from the other side of the wall).
The map doesn't lead to a specific treasure; rather it marks
out good routes through the Poor Quarter. Warbands who
have deciphered the map may add one of a kind in the next
exploration phase, after rolling the dice. For example a player
who rolled 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 6 could choose to add another 3
in order to find Prisoners (the result for a triple 3) rather than
a corpse (the result for a double 3). Alternatively, the player
could opt for an extra 5 or 6 in order to find something else
entirely. This addition does not affect how many Wyrdstone
shards the warband recovers. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

STARTING THE GAME
The player with the lower warband rating has first turn.
ENDING THE GAME
If one warband is able to decipher the writing on the wall,
and then ruin said writing, the scenario ends immediately,
and that warband wins.
If both warbands manage to decipher the writing, then the
scenario ends in a draw. If one warband deciphers the writing
and then routs, the game ends in a draw. If the writing is
somehow ruined before it can be deciphered by either
warband, the scenario ends in a draw.
Alternatively, if one side routs, the other wins. The winners
are assumed to decipher and orient the writing at their leisure.
EXPERIENCE
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for any enemy he puts out of action.
+1 for Deciphering the Writing. Any Hero who deciphers
the writing during the battle (limit 1 per warband) gains +1
Experience.
+1 for Ruining the Writing. Any Hero who ruins the
writing (after it has been deciphered!) earns +1 Experience.


##### Scenario: Spawn Hunting

By Thrasher Kitch
"Over there men! After it! 50 Crowns to the man who brings
that chaos beast down!" shouted Captain Alkazar to his men, as
they chased the twisted Chaos Spawn through the ruined streets
of what was once a productive farming village. In the time after
the comet fell, the streets of Mordheim were tainted by the touch
of the foul gods, and the effects visible in many areas. Men and
women bore twisted visages of their former selves, and much,
much worse was to be found. The touch of Chaos was laid
heavily on the land. Many priests of the righteous gods were
trying to do what they could, but some of the more physical
threats required a less spiritual touch, and more of a physical
beating.
In this case, a Chaos Spawn has been tracked down, and is
terrorizing its way through the remains of the city, and your
warband is chasing it, and trying to bring it down. Or maybe you're
trying to subdue it and bring it under your control, and then use it to
make it your loyal servant. Such a creature would be very, very
powerful to have under your control. However, you've run into a
snag.
Another warband has spotted you, and is closing in to intercept you
and stop the spawn themselves. What is their motive? Why are they
here? Such questions are not to be answered here.
Set Up
The setup is for two or more warbands. The warband with a
highest rating should be set up within 10" of one corner of the
board, as they are the warband hunting the spawn. Place the
spawn 16" from them, directly between them and the centre
of the board (always place it on ground level.) Place opposing
bands on the table edges opposing that player, and within 6"
of the edge. The player may pick which of the two sides he
starts on.
Note: If the warbands taking part in this campaign are highly
rated, you may be better off using multiple spawns instead of
one. So once you hit around 250, try 2, or at 375-400 try 3.
Etc. Alternatively, for multiple warbands, you could also do
it as “Number of Warbands -1” to determine how many
spawn you need.
Terrain
This scenario can take place in any locale. This could easily
be happening in the country side for Empire in Flames, or in
the ruined streets of Mordheim.
Starting the Game
The Spawn gets the first turn, and immediately make a move,
away from the band pursuing them. Then the hunting band
goes second, and roll a D6 for all other warbands taking place
in this scenario, with the highest going first.
This means the Spawn have their own turn, in addition to the
players, so here's the rundown of turn order:
Turn 1: Spawn
Turn 2: Pursuing Band (Highest Rated)
Turn 3-?: The remaining warbands, dice off for turn order.

Special Rules
Wyrdstone Necklace: Make note of which warrior(s) deliver
the killing blow to each of the spawn on the table. After the
fight, roll a D6 for each warrior who took a spawn OOA.
Whichever rolls the highest, he found a mysterious
Wyrdstone pendant around the neck of the spawn. He can
either wear it or sell the pendant to a wandering wizard for
10D6 GC. Should the warrior choose to put it on, consult the
following table for the result. (If the warrior in question is a
henchman, remove him from his existing group and place
him in his own group, which may never be added to again.).
Roll D6 after the game
1 The green stone drains the warrior of his vitality. Roll on
the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 reduce the stat
indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the warrior mutates. All
bands except chaos bands kill a mutating warrior as they start
to change, chaos bands (possessed, carnival of chaos,
beastmen and skaven) may roll a random mutation.
2 No effect beyond dark and troubled dreams.
3-6 Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9
increase the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the
player may choose any stat to increase by 1. The stone is not
powerful enough to increase a stat above a racial maximum,
if this is indicated roll again.
Ending the Game
The game ends only after the Spawn have been taken OOA
and only a single band is remaining on the table. Warbands
may voluntarily rout, following the normal instructions for
such in the Mordheim rulebook.
Experience
+1 Survival: Any Hero or Henchman group which survives
the battle gains +1 experience.
+1 Winning Leader: The Leader (or acting leader) of the
band gains +1 experience for winning the scenario.
+1 per Enemy out of action: A hero earns an additional +1
experience for each enemy they put out of action.
+1 Spawn Wound: A Hero or Henchmen group earns an
additional +1 experience for each wound they do to one of
the Spawn. (A henchman group may not gain more than +1
experience in this way.)


##### Scenario: The West Gatehouse

By Andy Tabor
There are many a vile warband that resides at Cut Throat's Den.
Cut Throat's Den is known to house unscrupulous warbands who
are some of the foulest scum to visit Mordheim. Warbands such as
the Righteous Sisters, Witch Hunters and other do-gooders would
shun such a decadent area.
The main path from Cut Throat's Den to The City of the Damned is
by the West Gatehouse. Normally, most would think nothing of
going to Mordheim via the West Gatehouse but danger lurks at
every corner of Mordheim and this area is not different. The West
Gatehouse remains guarded by a dark and sinister tree beast, and to
enter the city from this direction adventurer must first brave passing
by this monstrosity. Skeletons hang from its branches and who
knows how many skulls are entwined within its blackened roots.
Warbands tend to scale the walls or have found tunnels into the city
from the West side in order to avoid The Giant Oak that lurks at the
West Gatehouse.
The Great Oak that once stood near the ornate gates of the garden
uprooted itself and began a rampage of death and destruction. A
huge one hundred foot tall monster, it smashed through the
perimeter wall of the gardens and began to make its way to the West
Gatehouse where crowds had gathered in a desperate attempt to flee
the disaster.
With evil eyes glowing red, the instrument of the Shadowlord
stomped through the crowd sending broken bodies hurtling through
the air as its huge branches lashed out at the throng. Few managed
to escape the Northwester Quarter of the city during the disaster, as
the monster had rooted itself at the gateway slaughtering all that
dared to pass.
Many warbands have disappeared when they have ventured through
the West Gatehouse. There are rumours The Giant Tree guards not
only the West Gatehouse but treasure. The treasure horde has been
rumoured to include wyrdstone, jewels, armor, weapons, precious
and rare items.
Many warbands have decided to go after the Giant Tree together to
split the riches but many have died by the hands of The Great Oak
or my each other as truces only last as long as a warband wants.
Terrain
This is another great opportunity to use your Warhammer
Fortress set to use as a gatehouse and a surrounding wall
section. There should be terrain but not too much to block the
movement of The Great Oak. Each player takes it in turn to
place a piece of terrain, a ruined building, tower, wall, or
similar piece of terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up
within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6' if you want to use more
warbands or just like more space. Leave a 6” x 6” square in
the middle of the board for the Great Oak.
Set-up
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Special rules
The Giant Oak will be placed in the middle of the board.
Each warband will roll a D3 for the amount of Dark Dryad
that will be placed on the board. The Dark Dryad will be
placed on the board before players roll for sides and will be
placed 8 inches within the Giant Oak. The Giant Oak and
Dark Dryad will always be the last “player” go move or take
its turn.
The profiles of the Giant Oak and Dark Dryad can be found
in the Beasts, Monsters & Townsfolk section of the
Rulebook.

Warbands
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands). The Giant Oak and evil arbours will
be considered the last warband in order of play. I would
suggest that players take turns playing the Evil arbours.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one has failed their
Rout Test. If two or more warbands are left they may ally
together to end the game but they must agree on how to split
the hoard (if Great Oak and minions are OOA). If an
agreement cannot be worked out then they will fight it out
until a “gentlemen's” agreement is reached.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 For wounding the Shadow Dryad. Any Hero or
Henchman earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on
the Shadow Dryad.
+1 For wounding the Giant Oak. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Giant
Oak.
+2 For taking the Giant Oak out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Giant Oak out of action gets a bonus
+2 experience.


##### Scenario: The Raven Barracks

By Andy Tabor
The Raven Barracks, located North West side of Mordheim, housed
the military arm of Count Steinhardht. The Empire was deeply
embroiled in a bitter civil war. During this turmoil, Count
Steinhardt refused to commit his forces to any of the three warring
factions. The Count had the finest uniforms made for his soldiers. As
the Empire went to war, expending valuable resources on arms and
soldiers Mordheim grew rich in selling arms and supplies at
extortionate prices to any side. The weapons were for top quality
and craftsmanship.
After the great disaster the barracks are empty of soldiers. The
soldiers have perished or left the city as fast as they could. Now
many warbands are attempting to get to the Raven Barracks to stock
up on supplies for themselves or to sell them at a profit. The City of
the Damned is a dark and deadly place. The route to the barracks is
dangerous and leaving alive from the barracks might be more
difficult than the warbands think.
(Ideas taken from Town Cryer 23/25: Space McQuirk, Nick
Jakos, and Mark Havener)
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, wall, or similar piece of terrain. We
suggest the terrain is set up within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6'.
This is a great opportunity to use your Warhammer Fantasy
Fortress as the Raven Barracks. The barracks should be an
area that is at least 2' x 2' in the middle of the board. Plenty of
terrain should be around the barracks to provide cover and
some obstacles to get there.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 +1 crate for each
warband involved in the game on the tabletop to represent
where the crates are. The crates should be 10” inches away
from the table edge and 6” inches away from each other.
Once a model is in base contact with a crate they must wait
till the next turn to move with it. No warband may use
catacombs or other like skills as information provided only
gave a vague area of the barracks.
When a model First touches a crate roll a D6. If the result is a
1 then a trap has been activated. The model takes an automatic wound with no armour saves allowed. Only one trap per crate.
There are many options of supplies to have in the crates. Feel
free to change them to your gaming groups needs.
Supplies The supplies are in crates. Each crate can be carried
by a single model at normal movement rate (no running
allowed). Two models may carry a crate, in which case they
may run. While carrying a crate, the model may not fire any
missile weapons or use any spells. Cavalry, Monstrous Infantry, and Monstrous Cavalry may carry one treasure chest with no penalty. Chariots and Mounted Monsters may carry any number of chests with no penalty (though they may not move in the same turn a chest is loaded into it by another warband member) If attacked, the crate will
be dropped (unless the crate is in a chariot), ready to be carried by anyone coming into
contact with it. Once a model escapes off the board with the
crate, the model and crate cannot return to the board. Each
crate in the possession of a warband at the end of the game
earns them a roll on the Crate table.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get all his men
off his table edge with supplies or when all but one warband
have routed. If one or more warbands have allied, they may
choose to share the victory and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+ Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Leader with most supplies off the board. The
leader whose warband gets the most OFF the board then they
earn +1 Experience.
+1 Per Crate captured. If a Hero or Henchmen takes a crate
OFF the battlefield they earn +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: The Wizard’s Mansion

By Michael Havener
Not all of the ruined buildings in the city are ordinary houses. Some
notable structures were the abodes of important town leaders or
rich merchants. Tales are told of hidden rooms filled with treasure
in such homes. The warbands have discovered the location of one
such building. Rumours abound that the former owner also dabbled
in the arcane arts, which may explain why his home was almost
untouched by the devastation.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4" x 6". The first
building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the
objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
Warbands
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article),
representing the warband that reached the mansion first. The
defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective
building. Then the attacking warbands are set up as normal.
In addition, for each attacking warband beyond the first, the
defender rolls once on the table below to determine the
additional equipment his warband gets to start with. Each
item may only be found once. If the same number is rolled
more than once, re-roll. These items represent the findings of
the warband thus far and are meant to give the warband a
chance against multiple opponents.
D6 Item Found
1 Wooden Man
2 D3 doses of Mandrake Root
3 D3 doses of Crimson Shade
4 Lucky Charm
5 Holy (Unholy) Relic
6 Cathayan Silk Cloak
All of the above are described in the Mordheim rules except
for the Wooden Man. For rules on the Wooden Man, see new
items opposite.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Wizard’s Treasure
At the end of the game the winning warband finds all of the
items on the table above which were not found before the
battle. In addition, roll on the following chart to see what
additional items the warband finds in the mansion. Note that
you’ll roll for each item separately, apart from gold crowns,
which are always found. For example, you will need to roll a
4+ to find a Tome of Magic. Then roll to see if you find the
Gromril Sword and so on.
D6 Roll Needed
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Tome of magic 4+
Gromril sword 5+
Athame 4+
D3 doses of healing herbs 4+
Dispel scroll 5+
New items
Wooden Man: Use the stats and special rules for a zombie
with +1S and +1T. The Wooden Man is an artificial construct
in the shape of a man but made of wood. It will follow the
commands of the defending warband but will not leave the
wizard’s mansion for any reason, even after the game. The
Wooden Man may obviously not be traded.
Athame: An Athame is a special silver dagger used in
magical rituals. If used in combat, it will not hold its edge.
For the first attack in a game, it will count as a normal
dagger. However, for the rest of the game it will count as a
fist attack. The Athame is worth 10 gold crowns if traded.


##### Scenario: The Gaol

The battle in the Gaol grounds is a Skirmish. Both Warbands have
happened upon the area at the same time and are fighting it out for
control, so they can loot it. Little do they realise the presence of the
dreaded ‘Warden’...
Terrain
Choose any one neutral table edge of a 4'x4' area and place a
large ruined building on the chosen table edge just on the
table. This represents a part of the Gaol. The rest of the
gaming area represents the Gaol grounds and terrain should
be set up in a mutually agreeable manner.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating decides. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge. Players cannot choose the table edge
that has the Gaol building on or the edge opposite the Gaol.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score
takes the first turn. The Warden and the Inmates (see below)
take a turn after both players have had their turn and are
effectively a third player ie, after the last player has finished
his turn, the Warden and the Inmates get their first turn. Play
then continues as normal.

Special rules
The Warden and his Lackeys: Hidden within the dark
recesses of the Gaol is a thing known by local scavengers and
warbands as ‘The Warden’. No one knows what it once was;
some say it was a large guard dog, others that it is a bonded
and mutated group of prison guards. Whatever its true
origins, the Warden now wanders the ruins of the Gaol
feeding off any foolish enough to enter its realm. The Warden
is served by a group of ‘Inmates’ – surviving convicts of the
cataclysm since driven mad. They will attack and capture any
in their wake so their master may feed.
The Inmates have the same stats as a Dreg, you can also use
Dreg models to represent Inmates on the tabletop. There are
two Inmates in the scenario for each participating warband; they will work together as a
mob and must stay within 2" of each other at all times. They
will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest
warrior. If the Inmates manage to injure a warrior then ignore
the out of action result on the Injury table, instead the warrior
will be treated as stunned for D3 turns. Whilst a warrior is
stunned the Inmates will carry the warrior towards the
Warden (unless impeded by being charged, etc) at a rate of 4"
(they cannot charge or run whilst carrying the warrior). Note
that two Inmates can carry the warrior without reduction in
their movement, however, if reduced to one Inmate then the
remaining Inmate can only move 2" a turn. If they reach the
Warden in time, the stunned warrior is consumed. The
warrior is taken out of action and is considered dead for the
purposes of the campaign.
If this scenario is rolled before 10 games have been played then the Warden has the same statistics and abilities as a
Possessed. If more than 10 games have occured the Possessed gains +1 to all its characteristics. The Warden will move towards – and charge, if in
range – the nearest warrior. If it wins a combat it will move
towards the next nearest warrior.
NOTE: Both the Warden and the Inmates all start the game
within the Gaol and move out of this building towards the
warriors that are closest to it at first and then the warrior
that is closest to them, as described in the rules above.
If a Hero enters the Gaol and remains there until the end of
the game he will gain +1 dice for Exploration (even if an
enemy warrior is present).
    Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing Warband loses and their opponents win.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Winning Leader. The Leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action (this includes the
Inmates).
+2 Slaying the Warden. Should a Hero or Henchman group
put the Warden out of action they gain +2 Experience.



##### Scenario: Executioner’s Square

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
One of the oldest places in Mordheim, Executioner’s Square was
named for obvious reasons, the daily executions were a crowd
puller making the area busy and surrounding businesses successful.
Now the gallows and chopping block stand deserted amongst the
rubble. Since Mordheim’s downfall the many victims of
Executioner’s square – the guilty and innocent alike - have returned
as restless spirits eager to scream their anger at all who pass or
linger.
Both warbands have come to Executioner’s Square with one
purpose – to fight. Such places are often the arena for so-called
‘pitched battles’, open, bloody and vicious. Little do they realise of
the latent spirits, yearning to vent their anger against them.
Terrain
This scenario is played on a 4' x 4' playing area as normal. No
buildings can be placed in a central 2' x 2' area although they
can be placed along this boundary as this represents the
square. Rubble pieces and other such flotsam can be placed in
around the square as normal. In the centre of the square, place
a piece of terrain to represent the gallows and/or chopping
block. Place terrain in the remaining gaming area as normal.
The scenario works best if this is particularly dense.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating may choose. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with highest score takes
the first turn. If the result is a tie the player with the smaller
warband, in terms of actual models, may choose to go first or
second.

Special rules
Anger of the Damned: The restless spirits of Executioner’s
Square vent their eternal anger at any who roam in or close to
the square. They manifest as concentrated and violent gusts
of wind; the howling is their screams of rage. At the
beginning of each players turn roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the
spirits stay silent and nothing happens this turn. If the result
is a 2 or more a spirit attacks. If the number is even (2, 4, 6)
then the player whose turn it is must choose one of his
warriors to be attacked. If the number is odd (3, 5) then his
opponent must choose one of the controlling player’s
warriors to be attacked. Note it is always the player whose
turn it is that is attacked by spirits, the only difference is
whether or not he or his opponent chooses the affected
model.
An attacked warrior is automatically hit by a Strength 2
attack (no armor modifiers) and is blown directly backwards
D6". If an attacked warrior is in an elevated position such as
a gantry or an upper floor of a building then there is a good
chance he may be blown off and if this is the case treat the
model as falling. If a model is blown into a piece of terrain
(such as a mound of rubble or the wall of a building) or
blown into another warrior, friend or foe, then the warrior (or
both warriors if it hits another model) is knocked down but
may get up at the start of his next turn should he survive.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing warband loses and their opponents win.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Wining Leader. The Leader of the winning Warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Trophy from the Square. If a Hero manages to stay on
the gallows (or the piece of terrain representing the gallows)
at the centre of the square for one complete turn then he gains
+1 Experience.


##### Scenario: The Great Library

By Andy Tabor
The North-East Quarter of Mordheim was renowned for trade and
learning. When Mordheim was a living city, the crowded labyrinth
of streets and market plazas were called the Merchant's Quarter,
more commonly known as the District of the Flying Horse.
Mordheim became known as the finest market of the city in the
Empire, rivalling even the busiest ports as Marienburg. There were
many traders who would claim that for the right price they could
locate any object for you so desired in a day.
Another notable aspect of the North-Eastern Quarter was the Great
Library. During the rule of the extravagant Count Ignatius
Steinhardt, the library grew extensively to become the largest
building in the entire city. The Count was particularly fond of
collecting mystical and religious tomes. Of course, unwittingly, The
Great Library managed to collect on of the largest deposits of
Daemonic and Necromantic lore in the Empire.
Now after the disaster struck Mordheim Library was engulfed by
flames from the comet. Only the bravest ever consider going
anywhere near the ruins but the lure of ancient tomes is enough to
persuade mages from across the Empire to hire warbands to
retrieve any books that they can find. For enough gold, fools can
find enough bravery to risk even this dark place.
(Credit given to TC 25 Space McQuirk and Nick Jakos.)
Terrain
Each player will take it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a small building, or other piece of terrain. If you have
one piece of terrain or several that could “act” as the Library
should be placed in the middle. Many of the tomes have been
spewed across the many blocks close to the Library. The
battle is fought in an area roughly 4' x 4'. You may want to
make the table larger if this is to be a multiplayer game.
Special Rules & Set Up
Players should then place D3 +1 Tomes for each warband
involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the
Tomes are. Each player takes it in turn to place a Tome
counter. The counters must be placed more than 10” away
from the edge of the table and at least 6” away from each
other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which
edge the warbands will play from. A warrior can carry any
amount of Tomes without any penalty. Warriors cannot
transfer their Tomes to another warrior. If a warrior is put
OOA then the Tome is placed next to where the model was
taken OOA. The Tomes cause FEAR. You must take a FEAR
test to pick one up, unless you are immune to FEAR. This is
to represent the great unknown on whether or not the Tomes
are Evil. To represent the chaotic nature of the disaster and
the many magic tomes that are scattered in the area warbands
will roll on the Random Happenings.
Warbands will begin rolling on the Random Happenings
chart when the first model touches a tome and will continue
then at the beginning of each warbands turn. Yes, the first
warband that touches a Tome will roll on the Random
Happenings chart even though it will already be in the middle
of their turn.

Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’). Special deployment may not be used for this scenario, as whatever they think they have scouted probably will probably have changed by the time their comrades arrive.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table.
Ending the game
The game ends when all the warbands but one have failed
their Rout Test. Warbands that Rout, automatically lose. If
two or more warbands have allied they may choose to share
the victory and end the game, or they may continue the game
until one warband is victorious.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader(s). The leader of the winning
warband(s) gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each Tome Picked Up. If a Hero or Henchmen is
carrying a Tome counter at the end of the game he receives
+1 Experience.
+1 For the Warband with the Most Tomes. The leader of
the warband with the most tomes at the end of the game gains
+1 Experience.
Ill Gotten Gains...
You can sell the Tomes for 25 +1D6 or choose to keep the
scroll. If you keep a scroll then roll on the chart below (1D6).
Rolling on the chart below will represent that the Hero has
decided to open the scroll and is trying to decipher its
abilities. Please nominate which Hero will be opening the
scroll.
D6 Events
1. The Hero who keeps the scroll will set out the next
    game. You may come up with some creative on why
    he cannot play the next game from opening the scroll.
2. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain +1 Initiative.
    This can take you above our racial Maximum.
3-5. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain an Academic
    Skill. Those who normally cannot gain a Academic
    Skill can gain one (1) Academic Skill. Please note that
    this is for only one time and does not grant the user to
    gain Academic Skills through normal experience.
6. The Hero who opens the scroll will gain D3
    experience.



##### Scenario: The Middle Bridge

By Andy Tabor
The Middle Bridge is the main crossing point for the City of the
Damned. Whoever holds the bridge controls all aspects of movement
in Mordheim. The bridge is rumoured to have piles of Wyrdstone or
Treasure around it but are said to be guarded by massive Trolls,
who have a strange affinity for bridges.
Terrain
The gaming table can be as big as 4' x 4' or small as 2' x 2'.
You can easily make a bridge and river out of coloured paper
or plastic.
Special Rules
Place D3 +1 Trolls for each warband in the water and within
6” inches of the bridge. Place 1 Troll for each warband in the
middle of the bridge and the remainder Trolls should be
placed in the water. I would suggest that this scenario be
limited to one to two warbands. You can have one warband
go at a time to secure the bridge or have two warbands
attempt capture and control the bridge, while fighting off the
Trolls. In addition to the normal rules for Trolls, please use
the special rules below if you like.
Fog. The area will be affected by fog. Movement and
shooting distance will be halved. You may charge as normal.
Dumb Creatures of Habit. The Trolls under the bridge have
become so practiced and cunning at taking out travellers what
when a Troll is within 6” inches of the bridge it is allowed to
take Stupidity tests at double their normal leadership (all the
way up to 8). The Trolls will stay within 6” inches of the
bridge at all times.
Massive Troll. The Wyrdstone collected by the Trolls have
made them stronger. Their wounds and attacks are now 4
versus 3.
All Alone. Trolls are used to being all alone and will ignore
this rule.
Route Tests. Trolls will ignore all route tests.
River Trolls. Enemies attempting HTH with the Troll suffer
a -1 to hit. A roll of a 6 will always hit.

Warbands
All players roll a D6 to see who deploys first, with the player
rolling the highest choosing the table edge.
Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there. The Troll
will always go last.
Ending the game
The game ends when all but one warband has failed their
route test. The routers will automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 per Troll out of Action. Any Hero earns +2 Experiences
for each Troll he puts out of action.
Winning Warband Rewards
The winning warband may gain a onetime 5D6 gold. This
will represent collecting tolls from other warbands and
merchants who peddle their wares and will be able to choose
the next scenario they play by hearing rumours from
travellers passing through.
Optional Rules
If you are playing a structured map based campaign this is an
excellent scenario to gain control over parts of Mordheim.
There are many more additions you can make to this
scenario. You can tie it into the Encampment Rules. Another
option could a continued revenue generator throughout the
campaign, thus allowing the warband who controls the bridge
some revenue generated weekly or monthly. All this can
easily be decided by your gaming group. Your gaming group
can also change the type of monsters that live at the bridge. If
someone chooses to stand off and shoot at the Trolls from a
distance and keeping the Trolls within 6” inches of the bridge
shall punished with a Chaos Spawn coming onto the playing
table from their deployment and moving as fast as possible
towards that warband to engage in HTH with that warband.
You can be creative in this endeavour and punish those
warbands who have no backbone.

#### Scenario: Last Orders!

It can be found on the ambiguous borders of the
Chaos Wastes. Managed by coolheaded landlord
Knute Alsgaard, the Last Hope inn remains neutral
ground, a sanctuary where in theory, anyone is
permitted to enter. The Last Hope has been built to
withstand the worst kinds of predators in the
territory. It is as much a fortress as it is a watering
hole for exiles.
Visitors relinquish any weapons they are carrying
upon strict inspection. Sometimes these are returned
to their owners. Alsgaard is an astute dealmaker and
the Last Hope acts as a trading post that supplies arms
and opulent goods to travellers and warriors. Patrons
suffer the Norse proprietor’s inflation in isolation.
The potent house ale never disappoints a dwarf.
An unlikely mix of clientele frequents the Last Hope.
Here is where daring adventurers from Bretonnia may
come to discuss music with a Vampire. It is where a
Kossar dines frequently with warriors of the Kurgan
tribes. Imperial soldiers exchange information with
elves while casting a shifty gaze over at the ogres who
brought in whoever they pleased to do illicit trade
with.
On this particular evening the owner of the holding
decided to turn in early. Taking the evening off
Alsgaard leaves his customers in the capable hands of
a full complement of bar staff. A drink is spilled! The
brawl begins… 

Terrain
This scenario takes place inside a large inn. The layout
of the inn is decided by the players using any suitable
terrain that they have available, although we would
suggest the following:
The site of this ‘battle’ should consist of two or three
sections, at least 10” x 10”, and not needing to be
more than 18” x 18”. There is one section to represent
each floor of the inn.
The ground floor is the location of the bar room. It
should be relatively open. It should include a bar, a
few tables plus several chairs or benches scattered
around. Stairs lead up to the upper floor. There might
be a wine cellar, a kitchen, a store room or a lavatory.
The upper floor of the inn consists of a series of
rooms off a main hallway. Each room might include a
bed. Add other furnishings you desire. Do not forget
to include a marker to represent the top of the stairs
from below. Add another set of stairs to the next level
if you have one! The Last Hope is a fortress so it has
another floor, which is in the open air. The roof! 

Warbands
Animals, Mounts, and Monsters are not permitted within the tavern. That includes dogs nowadays!

set-up
The warbands are scattered about the inn when the
trouble starts. Randomly determine which floor of the
inn each warband member begins on. Then each
player takes turns placing each warrior in his warband.
Warriors may not be placed in hand-to-hand combat. 

starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The highest scoring player
takes the first turn. 

special rules
Diving Charges: Warriors may always attempt a Diving Charge from the tables and bar, irrespective of the
height of the furniture. Stairs may also be used.
Unarmed: All weapons have been confiscated for this game. Armour can be worn including helmets and
shields. Miscellaneous equipment can be carried.
Weapons Amnesty: Due to the generally non-lethal nature of the weapons used in this fight, players
should roll twice for Injury for each warrior taken out
of action during the game, and choose the best result.
Injuries for Heroes are rolled twice. In some cases,
which result is determined to be the best may be
something the player has to decide for himself!

ending the game
The warriors have been indulging in the inn's
refreshments and are now very refreshed indeed! No
Rout tests are necessary – the winner is the player with
the last standing model. Any player may voluntarily
rout if the excitement becomes too much. 

experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action. 

random happenings
The following random happenings replace the events
described in the Random Happenings section when
using this scenario.

At the start of each player’s turn, roll a D6. If the result
is 1 then roll another D6 to determine which event
takes place. Random happenings are commonplace in
the Last Hope! 

D6 Result
1 Kitchen Hands 
The warbands are not alone in the Last Hope. Nearly
a dozen hardened warriors are employed to run the
inn and keep it safe from outsiders. Kitchen workers
and bar staff enjoy a good brawl as well!
One randomly determined member of your warband,
that is not knocked down or stunned, takes a single
Strength 3 hit from the inn staff. These attacks will not
cause Critical Hits.

2 Buxom Barmaid 
A busty serving wench flits about the bar, flirting
with patrons. This barmaid has a body to die for…
The barmaid will approach a randomly determined
model from your warband and invite him to defend
her honour against the ‘nasty man over there’. That
warrior must pass a Leadership test or move with all
haste, escaping from combat if necessary, to charge a
randomly determined model. First the player must
roll to determine which warband (including his) and
then roll again to see which model is the target. The
optional rules for escaping from combat can be found
in the rulebook.
The warrior will pursue and fight his new rival until
one of them is taken out of action.
Warriors that are immune to psychology may ignore
the barmaid’s advances.
All of the warriors know that attacking the bar staff
can only result in them getting banned. No model will
risk attacking the barmaid.

3 Liquid Courage 
Heavy quaffing of Alsgaard’s intoxicating home brew
takes its toll on even the most hardened of drinkers.
Randomly determine which model fell off the wagon.
The effects of the ale last the remainder of the battle.
Models that are immune to poison ignore this effect.
 D6 Result
 1 Blurred. The model has -1 Ballistic Skill.
 2 Bungled. The model has -1 Weapon Skill
 3 Drowsy. The model has -1 Initiative.
 4 Sluggish. The model has -1 Movement.
 5 Fortitude. The model has +1 Wound.
 6 Leathered! Roll twice on this table.
 
4 Renegade 
There is a mercenary leaning against the wall. The
veteran casually observes the mayhem, quietly
sipping from his stein. Ducking crudely improvised
projectiles, this renegade waits to offer his services.
The renegade approaches a random unengaged
warrior of your warband. The model may pay him 3
gold crowns. Any models are assumed to be carrying
some of the gold crowns from whatever is left in the
warbands treasury.
If paid, he'll toss a throwing knife at a target of the
player’s choice. On a 1-3 the renegade pockets the
gold and asks for more. The renegade continues to
take a further 3 gold crowns until a knife is thrown or
until the player chooses not to pay him.
The thrown knife will hit the target on a roll of 4+
with Strength 4.

5 Ogre Bouncer 
The landlord has hired an ogre to work on the door.
The bouncer is not at all happy that he has suddenly
got so much hard graft to do.
Place the ogre bouncer at the doorway to the inn. See
the Bestiary for the profile and rules of an Ogre. No
roll for alignment is required. The bouncer is
employed to charge towards the nearest hand-to-hand
combat, engaging as many models as possible.
If no hand-to-hand combat is taking place then the
ogre bouncer will stand his ground, watching for any
further trouble.
Re-roll this result if the ogre has been places already.

6 Ornamental Weapon 
A member of the clientele has located a sword among
the many trophies and decorations on display at the
inn. The warrior sets to work trying to prise it free
from the wall fittings. It appears to be stuck fast.
Determine a random model from the warband. If the
warrior passes a Strength test he finds a sword.

Improvised weapons
Being forbidden to bring their weapons into the bar
means that the warriors must make do with whatever
comes to hand in the Last Hope. At the start of any
turn, a warrior can search the inn for a blunt
implement to use as a bludgeoning weapon. This
could be a bowl, a stein, a cooking ladle, the leg of a
chair or a local codger’s walking stick!). Only warriors
capable of gaining experience may attempt to search.

If a search is attempted the warrior may not charge.
Roll a D6: on a 3-6 the fighter finds something
suitable, but on a 1-2 nothing close by will work and
the warrior will have to make do with his fists. A
warrior searching for a weapon in combat will strike
last that turn, regardless of success. A warrior with a
weapon may not improvise another. If a weapon is
found, treat it as a club with the following features:

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user 
Breakable: If the warrior attempts a close combat
attack with an improvised weapon and rolls a 1 to hit,
the item has broken and becomes useless. The warrior
must resort to his fists for the rest of the combat and
may search for another weapon in the next turn.
Projectile: Alternatively, a warrior may treat the Projectile:
improvised weapon as a missile. The weapon is
automatically lost after it has been thrown. A weapon
is thrown as a missile using the following features.
Range: 6”; Strength: As user;
Special Rules: Thrown Weapon 


##### Scenario: The Statue of St. Voller

The story of Saint Voller is all but lost to history, the documentation of her works largely kept within the great libraries of Mordheim. Folklore and myth is all that survives by way of her legacy, but whatever the truth may have been she is revered by the Cult of Morr as one of their matron saints. Her statue was a place of pilgrimage to many who prayed that the dead keep their rest, and due to the wild and wonton magical experimentation present in Mordheim before the meteor strike her blessings were desperately sought after lest a lost loved one be forced to live an eternity of servitude at the hands of some vile necromancer some day. When the statue miraculously survived the meteor strike many survivors deemed it a blessing of Morr itself, and survivors brought their dead by the cartload to the statue in the hopes that their deaths be consecrated and their souls kept safe. Bodies piled the pavements, and with no safe way out of the city to bury the bodies the surrounding buildings became macabre warehouses stacked to the rafters with corpses simply to keep the roads clear.

So many dead and dying in one place was never going to end well. The sheer concentration of corpses and the opportunity to desecrate a shrine to a hated nemesis drew the attention of necromancers even beyond the city walls, and for a few mortifying months the plaza surrounding the statue became a Mecca for necromancers looking to practice their arts and refresh their supply of corpses. The district is lost to the undead now, for whatever riches it may hold simply aren't worth the inevitable wall of attrition that the thousands of reanimated corpses can provide, save for the statue itself. The Statue of Saint Voller maintains the properties of her patron god Morr, an anathema to all things undead. Undead who approach find their souls drained from their bodies, eventually disintegrating into nothingness without their sustenance. Harnessing the power of this statue or corrupting it to your own ends will prove a valuable asset within the City of The Damned, but warbands will need to move quickly. Noise awakens the unquiet dead within these sardine-packed buildings

Terrain
The city is set up as per regular Mordheim. In the centre of the battlefield should be a
large statue – the shrine representing Saint Voller.

Starting the game
Roll a D6, the highest roll goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise. Special deployment rules may not be used for this scenario, no scout would be mad enough to camp out in a warehouse so zombie-infested that there's no room to stand.

Special rules
The Unquiet Dead: At the end of each round turn every building's occupants will begin to stir. Gnarled and withered hands pull at boarded-up windows, and mindless groans dryly echo through the decreasingly deserted streets. For every building on the map roll a D6. On a result of a 1 or 2 D3+1 Zombies will emerge, touching the building and placed between it and the nearest Warband member. This counts as their movement action. If a Warband Member is in the building and is not Hidden then the Unquiet Dead subtract 2 from the roll to see if they emerge. If the nearest Warband member is inside the building then all emerging zombies from that building will immediately go into combat with them, counting as charging, and dividing up between all warband members inside. These Zombies are the same as the Henchmen from the Undead warband, though they do not grant any Experience for taking Out of Action.

Shhhhh!: The Unquiet Dead ironically prefer peace and quiet, being drawn to attack sources of noise nearby. If a Blackpowder Weapon is fired the nearest two buildings to the character who fired will immediately spawn zombies as if they had just rolled a 1 or 2 in the Unquiet Dead turn. 

The Statue of Saint Voller: Though Mordheim is lost and a wholly depraved place, the spirit of Saint Voller still exerts some guardianship. Unquiet Dead will never voluntarily move within 4" of the statue, and any Undead model that ends its movement phase within this zone must take a leadership test (they may use their warband leader's leadership). For every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. The statue itself holds an inky black pendant swimming with grey and purple shadows, a Talisman of Saint Voller. This talisman may be retrieved as if it was a shard of wyrdstone, with all the same rules as wyrdstone from the Wyrdstone Hunt.

Ending the game
The game ends when either all warbands but one have failed their rout tests, or if a character escapes the board with the Talisman of Saint Voller.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle
they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy (excluding Unquiet Dead) he puts out of action.

The Talisman of Saint Voller when worn by a non-Undead character causes Terror in Undead models, even though they would usually be immune to psychology. When worn by an Undead warband leader their warband will never crumble due to the loss of a Necromancer or Heirophant, even if the leader is taken Out of Action - their studying of Morr and corruption of Voller's Talisman has made their soul-binding more potent than ever before!

##### Scenario: The Merchant Square

By Andy Tabor
The once thriving Market Square, more commonly known as the
District of the Flying Horse has become a deserted plaza. Only the
exceptionally brave or downright foolhardy dare cross the open
cobbles, where once thousands of merchants sole their wares. To
venture into the Market Square is to expose oneself to all those who
keep a close watch from the surrounding shadow. Many eyes peer
from the dark alleys and ruined buildings, in search of a fresh
opportunity to make a quick killing. There is still a vast quantity of
precious and exotic goods lying in the broken cellars of merchant's
houses for the taking.
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.
In a terrible twist of fate, the Merchants Quarter remains the most
opulent region of the accursed city. Should any adventurous soul
wish to visit the ruined library or take a chance and stroll through
the market place, it is highly likely that they may discover some rare
goods that have survived the fall. Leaving the quarter with your life
is a different matter though, for the District of the Flying Horse is
also rich pickings for those who seek to spill blood.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building or something similar. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The middle
area of the board should free of terrain (maybe a fountain or
the like to mark the centre of the square) and to have at least
a 12” inch x 12” inch square open area. This will represent
the Merchant's Square. The buildings placed outside of the
Merchant's Square will represent the Merchant's Homes and
Shoppe's.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
Warbands will begin searching the buildings for common
items. Each warband will roll 1D6 for each searchable
building. If they roll a 4+ they found a common item. In the middle of the Merchant's Square will be D3 crates per warband, working in the same way as the Raven Barracks chests. When
a warband touches a crate they must roll a D6, only rolling once per crate. On a roll of a 1 on a D6, the Black Pegasus will
appear - this replaces the traps found in the Raven Barracks chests. The Black Pegasus will appear 8” inches in on a
Random Table edge. The Black Pegasus will go in the last
turn and will attempt to fly down on the models in the
Merchant's Square. The Black Pegasus will target the closest
model in the Merchant's Square. Merchant's Square is the 12”
x 12” area in the middle of the table as the streets and alleys
would be too narrow for the Pegasus to fly into. If the Black Pegasus is encountered after 10 games have been played in the campaign then it gains +1 to each of its attributes.

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where the players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When all the crates are off the table, all but one warband has
routed, or the warbands ally.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of a winning warband gain
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of Action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each crate taken off the board. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for taking a crate off the board.
Items
Common items are found in the houses surrounding the
Market's Square. They are kept no matter if you win or loose.
Remember you need to roll a 4+ for each house to see if you
were able to locate a common item. Only one opportunity per
house. Please keep track of what homes you searched so you
can take them off the list.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Morning Star 1
D3 Spears 2
D3 Bows 3
D3 Crossbow 4
1 Suit of Heavy Armor 5
D3 Nets 6
Rare items can only come from the crates placed in the
middle of the Merchant's Square. Rare items may only be
found if the crate is taken off the table. If no crates made if
off the table then no Rare Items will be found. You will be
much too nervous looking out for the other warbands and a
Black Pegasus to open the crate in the middle of the
Merchant's Square. When the game ends, the winning
warband(s) does not automatically get the crates.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Repeater Crossbow 1
D3 Handgun 2
D3 Healing Herbs 3
1 Gromril Weapon 4
1 Dose Bugman's Ale 5
1 Eleven Cloak 6

#### Scenario: Getting Personal

This scenario is designed for campaign games with any number of players present. A personal dispute has erupted between several famous/infamous characters in Mordheim, and eager to profit from the spoils of this sort of carnage the warbands have rushed in to pick at the remains. Unfortunately they appear to have been rather swept up in it all, and with famous names aligning themselves with warbands unexpectedly they find themselves in the midst of a sudden brawl!

Terrain
The board is set up as per normal Mordheim.

Set-up
Warbands deploy in their usual locations
.
Warbands
In this scenario each warband is joined by a randomly selected character from the list of MVPs! These characters are completely controlled by the owning player, though they are treated independently from your warband. They do not count for the purposes of either warband size or as losses for routing, and if your warband routs then the player may continue to play as the MVP. They also will not drop their unique items when defeated. 

Starting the game
Determined as normal.

Ending the game
The game ends if either one warband remains and all other MVPs have been taken out of action, or if all warbands are routed and there are only MVPs left on the board. In this case there are no winners.

If a warband wins the scenario AND their MVP is still alive then they recieve a bonus 3xp to be distributed as they see fit among their heroes as the MVP thanks them after the battle and tells them some stories!


#### Scenario: The Canal (Even number of players only)

Setup: This map takes place using four tiles. Leave an 8" gap between them running down the middle of the board, this represents the canal. The middle of the board will feature four buildings with two long walkways offering crossings over the canal. These are the only two crossing points, and are what the warbands are seeking to control. The rest of the board should feature dense terrain.

Deployment: The warbands deploy up to 12" towards the canal from the corners and 8" towards the opposite table edge. Scout, Infiltrate, and Hunch may not be used in this scenario.

Special Rules: The syrupy swamp-thick muck of Mordheim's polluted canal is home to monsters disgustingly mutated and horrific enough to chill a vampire's marrow. At the start of each round turn (before the first player's go) roll a dice for each warband member in the canal. If any of these results is a 1, then the Abomination has arrived. Randomize which end of the canal it emerges from and it will then move as quickly as possible towards the opposite table edge engaging in combat with nearest model where possible. It is unaffected by the difficult terrain, and if its movement takes it to the table edge it will stop and then turn around. It will repeat this patrolling action until the game is over or it is taken out of action.

Before the comet struck the canals were infamous for their vile pollution, the canal's waters so contaminated with sewage and alchemical reagents' run-off that even droughted beggars wouldn't consider drinking it. The latent wyrdstone energies brought about by the cataclysmic meteor have hardly improved things, transforming the waters into a toxic slurry that coats the flagstones around it like bile. Attempting to leave the canal will require a climbing check as warband members struggle to find purchase on the smooth treacherous stone. This means it requires an initiative test, and mounted units will be unable to exit at all as they become bogged down in the goop. Alternatively a friendly model of the same or larger unit type can move into contact with them and take a strength test to pull them free (good luck pulling an ogre out of a swamp, Brian.) Additionally the waters are so blighted and foul that all Nurgle-aligned models suffer from Stupidity while inside it as they wantonly revel in the filth.

Ending the game: After eight turns the game will end. A warband has won the scenario if either it controls at least three out of the four objective buildings by the end of the eighth turn (only contains warband members owned by the player) or is the last warband remaining.

Rewards:
+1xp for Occupation. If the game ends by turn limit then for each building a warband controls it can give a bonus XP point to one of its occupying members. 
+1 xp for wounding the Abomination. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully wounds the Abomination gains a bonus experience.
+2xp for putting the Abomination OOA. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully puts the Abomination out of action gains a bonus experience.
Extort Tolls: Warbands that do not rout by the end of the game gain 30 gold per building they control.


The Abomination is a Monster and has the following profile:
M	WS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
2d6	4	5	6	5	1	2D6	10	-

Special Rules:
Ravenous Maw: The Abomination's great slavering orophice is yawning enough to acommodate the largest prey. There is nothing beyond its appetites. It therefore has the Heroic Killing Blow ability.
Magical Monstrosity: The Abomination is a Chaos Spawn so mutated by the twisting of reality caused by the saturation of Wyrdstone energy that the very Winds of Magic distort and tear around it. The Abomination has a 4+ ward save against wounds or failed characteristic tests caused by spells.
Terror
Large Target
No Pain: The Abomination ignores all Knocked Down and Stunned results, instead reducing its attacks characteristic to D6 until the Abomination's next turn.
Immune to Poison
Immune to Psychology


### Income

At the end of each battle, a warband may roll on the
Exploration chart. This is done as soon as a game is over so
that players can witness each other’s dice rolls. As you can
see from the chart, a warband that is just starting out has little
chance of finding the more obscure places in Mordheim.
However, a warband will make more discoveries as it goes
along thanks to its better equipment and accumulated skills.
Roll a D6 for each Hero in your warband who survives
without going out of action. This represents the warband’s
efforts to unearth wyrdstone. Do not roll for any Heroes who
went out of action during the battle; they are taken back to
the warband’s encampment to recuperate instead. So, for
example, if your warband includes four Heroes who all
survived the last battle, you can roll four dice. If you won
your last game, you may roll one extra dice. Add the results
of the dice together and consult the Exploration chart to see
how many shards of wyrdstone your warband has found.
Do not roll for Henchmen. This does not mean that they don’t
search the ruins, but instead represents the efforts of the
Heroes in coordinating the search parties. In addition, some
Henchmen like Zombies or Warhounds (for obvious reasons)
are not particularly useful when it comes to looking for
wyrdstone.

#### Rolling multiples

As well as finding shards of wyrdstone, the warband can
come across unusual places or encounter inhabitants of the
ruined city. If you roll two or more of the same number while
searching, you have found an unusual building or
encountered something out of ordinary. Consult the chart and
refer to the appropriate entry in the Exploration results.
For example, you might roll two 3’s or three 5’s, in which
case you should refer to the chart. Choose the most numerous
multiples if you score more than one set of multiples. So, if

you rolled a double 3 and a triple 5, only look up the triple 5
on the Exploration chart. In the case of two doubles or triples
look up the highest result. For example, if you rolled double
1 and double 3, look up the double 3 result.
Any money or loot you find in these locations is added
straight to the warband’s treasury. Any shards of wyrdstone
you find can be sold as normal.
#### Exploration procedure

1. Roll 1D6 for each of your Heroes who survived the battle and
one extra dice if you won, plus any extra dice allowed by skills
or equipment. Note, however, that you must pick a maximum of
six dice out of all the dice you roll, even if you are allowed to
roll seven dice or more.
2. Some things, such as skills and equipment, (like the
Mordheim Map) may allow you to re-roll dice. If your warband
includes an Elf Ranger, you may modify one dice by +1 or -1.
3. If you rolled any doubles, triples, etc, you have found an
unusual location in Mordheim. Consult the Exploration chart on
the next page to see what you find. Refer to the appropriate entry
on the following pages and follow the instructions given there.
4. Add the results together and consult the chart on the next page
to see how many shards of wyrdstone you have found. Mark
down the amount of wyrdstone on your warband’s roster sheet.
    NUMBER OF WYRDSTONE SHARDS FOUND

##### Doubles

(11) Well
The public wells, of which there were several in Mordheim,
were covered by rooves raised up on pillars and adorned
with carvings and fountains. The city was proud of its water
system. Unfortunately, like all the other wells, this one is in a
parlous state and undoubtedly polluted with wyrdstone.
Choose one of your Heroes and roll a D6. If the result is
equal to or lower than his Toughness, he finds one shard of
wyrdstone at the bottom of the well. If he fails, the Hero
swallows tainted water and must miss the next game through
sickness.

(22) Shop
The Merchants Guild shop has been thoroughly ransacked.
Even so, there are still items scattered around the single,
long room, mingled in with the rubble. Some are useful, such
as cast iron pots and pans and rolls of fine cloth. All manner
of smaller items are lying about – the sort of frippery which
no longer has a use in a devastated city with few inhabitants.
After a thorough search you find loot worth D6 GC.
If you roll a 1 you will also find a Lucky Charm (see the
Equipment section, page 53).

(33) Corpse
You find a still-warm corpse. A chipped dagger sticks out of
his back. Surprisingly, his possessions have not been looted.
To see what you find when you search the corpse, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1-2 D6 GC
3 Dagger
4 Axe
5 Sword
6 Suit of light armor

(44) Straggler
Your warband encounters one of the survivors of Mordheim,
who has lost his sanity along with all his worldly possessions.
Skaven warbands can sell the straggler to agents of Clan
Eshin (who will use the man for food or slavery) and gain
2D6 GC.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the unfortunate individual
for the glory of the Chaos gods. The leader of the warband
will gain +1 Experience.
Undead warbands can kill the man and gain a Zombie for no
cost.
Any other warband can interrogate the man and gain insight
into the city. Next time you roll on the Exploration chart, roll
one dice more than is usually allowed, and discard any one
dice. (For example, if you have three Heroes, roll four dice
and pick any three).
 
(55) Overturned Cart
Stuck in a ruined gateway is an overturned wagon – the
covered type that nobles travel in from the city to their estates
in the country. Since anyone important fled a long time ago,
what is it doing here? The horses have broken their traces, or
did someone cut them free?
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Mordheim Map (see Miscellaneous Equipment)
3-4 A purse with 2D6 GC
5-6 Jewelled sword and dagger. These can be kept or sold
at twice the value of a normal sword and dagger, but
note that the normal selling price is half the actual cost
(see the Trading section for rules on selling items), so
the jewelled sword will sell for 10 GC, for instance.
 
(66) Ruined Hovels
The street consists of ruined hovels, which are leaning over
at alarming angles. Not much worth looting here.
You find loot worth D6 GC amidst the ruins.


##### Triples

(111) Tavern
The ruin of a tavern is recognisable by its sign still hanging
on the wall. The upper part of the building is ruined, but the
cellars are cut into rock and are still full of barrels. There
are broken flagons and tankards everywhere.
You could easily sell the barrels for a good price.
Unfortunately your men are also interested in the contents!
The warband’s leader must take a Leadership test. If he
passes, the warband gains 4D6 GC worth of wines and ales
which can be sold immediately.
If he fails, the men drink most of the alcohol despite their
leader’s threats and curses. You have D6 GC worth of
alcohol left when the warband reaches their encampment.
Undead, Witch Hunter and Sisters of Sigmar warbands
automatically pass this test, as they are not tempted by such
worldly things as alcohol.

(222) Smithy
The furnace and toppled anvil make it obvious what work
was done here. Most of the iron and the tools have been
looted long ago. Coal and slag litter the floor but there may
still be weapons to be found among the debris.
Roll a D6 to determine what you find inside:
D6 Result
1 Sword
2 Double-handed weapon
3 Flail
4 D3 Halberds
5 Lance
6 2D6 GC worth of metal (add the value to your
treasury).

(333) Prisoners
A muffled sound comes from one of the buildings. Inside you
find a group of finely dressed people who have been locked in
a cellar. Perhaps they are prisoners taken by cultists, ready
to be sacrificed during Geheimnisnacht.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the victims (undoubtedly
finishing the job of the captors). They gain D3 Experience
which is distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
Undead warbands can callously kill the prisoners and gain D3
Zombies at no cost.
Skaven can sell the prisoners into slavery for 3D6 GC.
Other warbands can escort the prisoners out of the city. For
their trouble, they are rewarded with 2D6 GC. In addition,
one of the prisoners decides he wishes to join the warband. If
you can afford to equip the new recruit with weapons and
armor, you may add a new Henchman to any of your human
Henchman groups (with the same stats as the rest of the
group, even if they have already accumulated experience).

(444) Fletcher
This hovel was once the workshop of a fletcher – a maker of
bows and arrows. There are bundles of yew staves and
willow rods everywhere.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Short bows
3 D3 Bows
4 D3 Long bows
5 Quiver of hunting arrows
6 D3 Crossbows
 
(555) Market Hall
The market hall was raised up on pillars, with the timbered
corn exchange above the open market place. The upper
storey has been badly damaged, but the covered market still
offers a good deal of shelter. The remains of the last market
day are still lying around on the cobbles. Most of this is
broken pottery and iron pots.
You find several items worth 2D6 GC in total.
 
(666) Returning a Favour
As you are returning to your encampment, you meet one of
your old acquaintances. He has come to repay an old favour
or debt.
You gain the services of a single character from your Warhammer book worth up to 75pts. They may not use any magic items. They will join your warband for the next game only before leaving. They will not contribute to your exploration dice, but do not require upkeep either - they are completely free.


##### Four of a kind

(1111) Gunsmith
You find the workshop of a Dwarf gunsmith. Its doors have
been broken down and the rooms raided, but some of the iron
strongboxes have survived intact.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1 Blunderbuss
2 Brace of pistols
3 Brace of duelling pistols
4 D3 Handguns
5 D3 Flasks of superior blackpowder
6 Hochland long rifle

(2222) Shrine
Your warband stumbles across a ruined shrine, which is so
badly damaged that it is difficult to tell which god was once
worshipped within its walls. A few images remain on the
painted plaster walls but they have been defaced by heretics.
Fragments of smashed statues lie among the ruins. Some
items appear to be covered in gold leaf, most of which has
been torn off.
Your warband may strip the shrine and gain 3D6 GC worth
of loot.
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunter warbands may save some
of the shrine’s holy relics. They will gain 3D6 GC from their
patrons, and a blessing from the gods. One of their weapons
(chosen by the player) will now be blessed and will always
wound any Undead or Possessed model on a to wound roll of
2+.

(3333) Townhouse
This three-storey house was once part of a tenement block
overlooking a narrow alleyway. The street is now in ruins,
but this house remains largely intact. Exploring it you find
that the garret leans over so far that you can step out of the
window into the attic of the house opposite.
Your warband finds 3D6 GC worth of loot.

(4444) Armorer
A breastplate hanging from a pole drew your attention to this
place, obviously too high up to be easily looted. The
workshop is ruined and the forge has been smashed. Rooting
about in the soot, you find various half-finished items of
armor.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Shields or bucklers (choose which)
3 D3 Helmets
4 D3 Suits of light armor
5 D3 Suits of heavy armor
6 Suit of Ithilmar armor
 
(5555) Graveyard
You find an old graveyard, crammed with sepulchres that are
overgrown with ivy. The monuments to the dead are
grotesque and decorated with sculpted gargoyles. The
ironwork has been ripped from some of the tombs, and stones
have toppled off. It looks as if some of the crypts have
already been broken into by tomb robbers.
Any warband apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar
may loot the crypts and graves and gains D6x10 GC worth of
loot.
If you loot the graveyard, the next time you play against
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunters, the entire enemy
warband will hate all the models in your warband. Make a
note of this on your warband roster sheet.
Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar may seal the graves.
They will be rewarded for their piety by D6 Experience
points distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
 
(6666) Catacombs
You find an entrance to the catacombs and tunnels below
Mordheim.
You can use the new tunnels you found in the next battle you
play. Position up to three fighters (not Rat Ogres or the
Possessed) anywhere on the battlefield at ground level. They
are set up at the end of the player’s first turn and cannot be
placed within 8" of any enemy models.
This represents the warriors making their way through the
tunnels, infiltrating enemy lines and emerging suddenly from
below ground.


##### Five of a kind

(11111) Moneylender’s House
A grand mansion, that is strongly built from stone, has
survived the cataclysm remarkably well. A carved coat of
arms adorns the lintel above the doorway although it has
been defaced by raiders and the symbols are now
unrecognisable. The door itself, has been smashed open with
axes and hangs open on its hinges.
Inside, hidden amongst the debris, you find D6x10 GC to add
to your treasury.

(22222) Alchemist’s Laboratory
A narrow stairway leads down into a crypt-like dwelling
which was once an alchemist’s workshop. The sign still
hangs from one hinge above the entrance. It looks as if this
was a very old building which has remained in use for
centuries although it did not survive the comet’s destruction
too well. The stone floor has strange symbols on it and there
are charts and astrological symbols painted onto the walls.
In the ruins you find loot worth 3D6 GC and a battered old
notebook. One of your Heroes may study the Alchemist’s
notebook, and the extra wisdom he gains will enable him to
choose from Academic skills whenever he gains a new skill
in addition to those skills normally available to him.

(33333) Jewelsmith
The houses in the jewellers’ quarter have all been well and
truly looted long ago. Even the rubble has been picked over
many times for fragments of gold and gems. But still, some
small but valuable items may have been overlooked.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Quartz stones worth D6x5 GC
3-4 Amethyst worth 20 GC
5 Necklace worth 50 GC
6 A ruby worth D6x15 GC
If your warband does not sell the gems, one of your Heroes
may keep them and displays them proudly. He will gain +1 to
the rolls for locating rare items as merchants flock to such an
obviously wealthy warrior.

(44444) Merchant’s House
The merchant’s house stands by the waterfront. It has a
vaulted stone undercroft which is still stacked with barrels
and bales of cloth. The foodstuffs have been looted or eaten
long ago and huge rats infest the rotting bales. Up the stairs
are the dwelling quarters, solidly built of timber, although
badly damaged you think you can still get up to them but
you’ll need to tread with care!
Inside you find several valuable objects which can be sold for
2D6x5 GC. If you roll a double, instead of finding money
you find the symbol of the Order of Freetraders. A Hero in
possession of this gains the Haggle skill.
 
(55555) Shattered Building
The comet destroyed this building almost completely, making
it unsafe for all but the most daring to explore. But places
such as this are the best for searching for wyrdstone shards.
You find D3 shards of wyrdstone amongst the ruins. In
addition take a Leadership test against the warband leader’s
Leadership value. If passed a war dog that was guarding the
building joins the warband.
 
(66666) Entrance to the Catacombs
You find a well-hidden entrance to the dark catacombs which
extend for miles beneath the city of Mordheim. Although the
entrance looks foreboding the tunnels will take hours off your
searches of the city.
You can use these tunnels to explore Mordheim more
efficiently. From now on, you may re-roll one dice when you
roll on the Exploration chart. Make a note of this in your
warband’s roster sheet. Second and subsequent catacomb
entrances you find do not grant you any additional re-rolls,
although you may find further re-rolls from other sources.


##### Six of a kind

(111111) The Pit
You have come within sight of the Pit, the huge crater created
by the comet. A black cloud still rises from it but you can see
glowing wyrdstone everywhere. This is the domain of the
Shadow Lord, the lord of the Possessed, and no-one is
welcome here – even his own followers!
If you wish, you can send one of your Heroes to search for
any wyrdstone hidden here. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the Hero
is devoured by the guardians of the Pit and never seen again.
On a roll of 2 or more he returns with D6+1 shards of
wyrdstone.

(222222) Hidden Treasure
In the depths of Mordheim, you come across a hidden chest,
bearing the coat-of-arms of one of the noble families of the
town.
When you open the chest you find the following items. Roll
for every item on the list separately (apart from the gold
crowns) to see whether you have found it. For example, on a
roll of a 4+ you find the wyrdstone.
Items D6 Result Needed
D3 Pieces of wyrdstone 4+
5D6x5 GC Auto
Holy relic 5+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D3 Gems worth 10 GC each 4+
Elven cloak 5+
Holy tome 5+
Magical artefact 5+

(333333) Dwarf Smithy
You find a solidly built stone workshop. A runic inscription
indicates that this may have been a Dwarf smithy.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result
1 D3 Double-handed axes
2 D3 Suits of heavy armor
3 Gromril axe
4 Gromril hammer
5 Double-handed gromril axe
6 Gromril armor

(444444) Slaughtered Warband
You find the remains of an entire warband. Broken bodies lay
scattered among the ruins, torn apart by some monstrous
creature. You see a huge shape, which looks like an immense
Possessed creature, shambling away.
After giving the dead their final rites (Sisters of Sigmar or
Witch Hunters), eating them (Skaven or Undead) or looting
them (anyone else!) you find the following items. Roll for
every item separately (apart from the gold coins and daggers)
to see if you find it. For example, on a roll of 4+ you will find
the suits of light armor.
Item D6 Result Needed
3D6x5 GC Auto
D3 Suits of light armor 4+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D6 Daggers Auto
Mordheim Map 4+
D3 Halberds 5+
D3 Swords 3+
D3 Shields 2+
D3 Bows 4+
D3 Helmets 2+
 
(555555) Fighting Arena
During better times, Mordheim was famous for its duellists
and pit fighters. You have found one of the areas used to
train these warriors. The place is filled with training
equipment and practice weapons.
You find a training manual, which you can either sell for 100
GC or let one of your Heroes read. The extra knowledge your
Hero gleans from reading the manual entitles him to choose
from Combat skills whenever he gains a new skill, and his
WS may now be increased by an extra point above his normal
racial maximum (for example, a Human who has the book
would now have a maximum Weapon Skill of 7).
 
(666666) Noble’s Villa
You find a fine house which is partially ruined. It has been
thoroughly ransacked and all the furniture has been stripped
of its fine fabrics. Shards of broken pottery of the finest
quality are scattered over the floor.
Roll a D6. If you roll 1-2, you find D6x10 GC worth of items
and money to add to your treasury. On a roll of 3-4, you find
D6 vials of Crimson Shade. On a roll of 5-6 you find a
hidden magical artefact carefully concealed in a hidden cellar
or behind a secret door. Roll on the Magical Artefacts table.


#### Magical artefacts table

Roll a D6 and use this table to determine which item you find when a result in the Exploration chart indicates that you have
found a magical artefact. In a campaign none of these items can appear more than once, so if you find a magic item which
is already in someone else’s possession roll again – even if the warrior carrying it has been killed.

1 The Boots and Rope of Pieter
Pieter, the master thief of the Guild of Shadows, was the most
famous of all the cat burglars of Mordheim. He earned the
nickname ‘Spider’ for his daring robberies. The secret of his
success was a pair of enchanted boots and a magical rope
which he had acquired from far-off Araby.
A model wearing these boots may move normally (including
running, charging, etc) on any kind of terrain, including
vertical surfaces. When moving the model, simply adds the
distances moved horizontally to that moved vertically, with
no Initiative test needed (except to jump across gaps).

2 The Count of Ventimiglia’s Misericordia
This dagger was used by the notorious Tilean gentleman-
pirate known as the ‘Black Corsair’. It is claimed that he
found it in ancient Elven ruins and legend also has it that the
dagger’s blade cannot be damaged in any way.
The dagger is treated as a sword. Opponents wounded by it
are Stunned on a result of 1-3 (Undead are Knocked Down as
normal) and put Out Of Action on a 4-6.

3 Att’la’s World-Treading Mail
This armor was given as a present by the Dwarf Lord
Kurgan to the warlord Att’la in the time of Sigmar
Heldenhammer.
Att’la’s World-Treading Mail is a suit of Light Armour with the
following three runes inscribed on it:
Rune of Spell Eating: The Hero wearing this
armor is immune to all spells.
Rune of Passage: The Hero can move through solid
objects, like walls (this does not mean that he can
see through them).
Rune of Fortitude: The Hero has an extra wound.


4 Bow of Wasting
This bow was a gift to Count Steinhardt from the Elf lords of
the Forest of Shadows, its blighted quiver said to contain the
secrets of Morr himself.
The Bow of Wasting can be equipped by any character capable of learning Shooting Skills, has a range of 24" and a Strength of 4. If a model is successfully wounded by the Bow of Wasting then it will lose one point of Toughness in each of its recovery phases for the remainder of the game. 
 
5 Executioner’s Hood
Recovered from a shipwrecked Dark Elf vessel, this hood
carries evil glowing runes which fill the wearer with
unreasoning unfathomable bloodthirst.
A warrior wearing this becomes subject to and always will be
frenzied even if he is knocked down or stunned and adds +1 to their strength. 
The wearer never leaves combat under any
circumstances, and will always attack opponents in base
contact until they are taken out of action. If the wearer is
in contact with multiple enemies they may direct attacks at 
_incapacitated_ enemies even if there are also standing foes present.
If there are any stunned or knocked down models within the
wearer’s charge range at the beginning of his turn, he will
charge and attack the closest one, even if they are members
of his own warband! Fight the hand-to-hand combat until one
of the warriors is taken out of action.
 
6 All-Seeing Eye of Numas
This jewel was recovered from the ruins of Numas far in the
south. It gives its wielder horrific nightmares that predict his
future, but an absolute clairvoyance too.
The bearer of the All-Seeing Eye can see all models on the
table top, even if they are hidden or out of sight. He can guide
his fellow warband members through the ruins (this allows
you to roll two dice for the bearer after battle when rolling on
the Exploration chart). The bearer may also roll a D6 whenever they
are hit by an attack. On a 6 the hit is discarded.
All animals (such as War dogs, horses, etc) will be affected
by frenzy when fighting against the bearer of the All-Seeing
Eye.


#### Selling wyrdstone

Wyrdstone is tremendously valuable and is in constant
demand by Imperial nobles. This means that finding buyers
for your warband’s wyrdstone is not difficult. You do not
have to sell all your wyrdstone immediately after the battle –
you may want to hoard it and sell it later, as selling
wyrdstone in smaller quantities will increase demand and
raise the price. Unfortunately, the demands of running a
warband often mean that you will have to sell most of your
wyrdstone as soon as you find it.
The warband must spend a large portion of its income on
basic necessities such as food, drink, repair of weapons, and
new arrows and ammunition, as well as celebrating! A
warband leader is also expected to share any profits made by
selling wyrdstone between his men which means that the
more money the warband makes from such sales, the bigger
the share for the men.
The more models there are in the warband, the more it costs
to maintain and the higher the level of any profits made that
must be shared between the men. The number indicated on
the following chart is the profit in gold crowns earned after
deducting the warband’s maintenance costs. The profit is
added to warband’s treasury.

#### Sisters of Sigmar and income

Worldly possessions mean little to the Sisters, but their holy
mission to purify Mordheim of the influence of Chaos
requires supplies and weaponry, and these are much in
demand. Thus the warbands of the Sisterhood compete with
each other to gain the best weapons and equipment from the
temple’s armory.
To measure their success, the more wyrdstone the Sisters
bring to be kept under lock and key in the Vault of
Vindication in the temple at Sigmar’s Rock, the more aid
they will receive from the temple.
Thus all gold crowns in the possession of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband represent the resources that the High Matriarch will
put at their disposal. It does not represent money in a literal
sense, so you may like to think of it as faith, piety,
dedication, etc.
#### Skaven and Undead

Neither of these warbands puts much value on gold, but they
send all the wyrdstone they find to their superiors and receive
aid and resources in return. Skaven use their own currency
for trading, while the Undead are somewhat beyond petty
concepts of wealth. For Skaven, the gold crowns in the
warband’s treasury represent the warp tokens which the
Skaven use for currency, while for the Undead it represents
the favour they enjoy in the eyes of their master, Vlad von
Carstein of Sylvania.
#### Spending income

You can spend any accumulated money on weapons, armor,
hiring new warriors, buying new equipment or simply save
the money for a bigger purchase. See the Trading section for
details.


### Tr a ding

Every Settlement around the city of Mordheim has at least
one trading post, shop or merchant’s guildhouse where the
local traders sell their wares and buy wyrdstone and other
items that have been scavenged from the ruins. In a large
village such a place might cover a substantial area with many
traders and merchants offering their goods and services.
Small settlements are served by travelling traders.
All warbands are able to get new equipment one way or
another. The most unscrupulous merchants actively trade
with the Possessed Cultists, and creatures such as the Skaven
have their own network of contacts, while Vampires can send
the Dregs that serve them into the less salubrious settlements
around Mordheim, such as Cutthroats’ Haven.

#### Spending cash

After every game, a warband can collect income from
exploration, etc, and sell any wyrdstone and treasures they
have acquired. Cash can be spent on recruiting new warriors,
or on new equipment for the warband.
The price of wyrdstone varies according to current demand.
See the Income section for details.

#### New recruits

New warriors are recruited in the same way as the original
warband with the notable exception of equipment. After the
start of a campaign, a new hireling can only buy Common
items from his warband’s equipment chart freely. He may
only be given Rare items from his warband’s equipment chart
if the warband can obtain them via the normal trading rules.
Warbands may recruit whatever type of warriors the player
wishes, but the usual restrictions apply regarding the number
of Heroes, Henchmen, wizards, etc. For example, no warband
may recruit a second leader, and no Mercenary warband can
have more than two Champions.


#### New recruits and existing henchmen

#### Groups

You may add new recruits to existing Henchman groups. If
the group is relatively inexperienced, you will have no
difficulty in finding raw recruits to add to their numbers. But
more experienced gnarled veterans are not so keen on letting
novice warriors join them – and quite rightly so! Between
each battle, roll 2D6: this represents the experience of the
warriors currently available for hire. You can hire as many
warriors as you wish, as long as their combined Experience
does not exceed your dice roll. For example, if you rolled 7,
you could add a single warrior to a Henchman group with 7
Experience points, or two warriors to a Henchman group with
3 Experience points, or any combination thereof. Disregard
any excess Experience points.
As with other new Henchmen, you must pay for all their
weapons and armor, and in addition you must add 2 gold
crowns to their cost for each extra Experience point they add
to the warband’s total. New Henchmen must be armed and
equipped in the same way as existing members of the group.

#### Weapons

If a player wants to buy new weapons or other equipment for
existing warriors, refer to the Price chart that follows. The
chart lists all the equipment available in Mordheim, not just
the common weapons included in the Recruitment charts.
Rare items and weapons are not always available and vary in
price. Remember that your warriors lack the skill to use any
weapons other than the ones listed in the Recruitment charts.
You may still want to buy rare items offered to you, as your
warriors may be able to use them as they gain in experience.
Players should preferably complete any recruiting and trading
after the battle is over, making the appropriate dice rolls
whilst both players are present.
However, some players may prefer to wait until the heat of
battle has cooled and they are able to consider purchases
more carefully. Determine which rare items are offered for
sale while both players are together. The players can work
out what they will buy later.
#### Trading

Trade items are divided into two sections: common and rare
items. Common items can be bought quite readily in any of
the numerous trading posts and settlements around
Mordheim. Players may purchase as many of these items as
they want. The price of common items is fixed, so players
always pay the same rate for them.
Rare items are hard or even impossible to come by. Only
occasionally do such items turn up for sale and the price
asked is often way above the true value. These items are
often offered only to the most famous warbands, or those
with the most money.
#### Availability

The Price chart has a column marked ‘Availability’. Common
items are always available, and can be bought in any
quantity. Items marked ‘rare’ are more difficult to find. A
rare item’s availability is indicated by a number, for example
‘Rare 9’.
Whenever a Hero wants to buy a rare item, roll 2D6 and
compare the result to the number stated. If the roll is equal or
greater, the item is available. For example, you need to roll 9
or more to acquire an item marked ‘Rare 9’. You can only
buy one rare item for each successful roll. You may also only
make one roll for each Hero looking for rare items. For
example, if your warband has four Heroes, you may make
four rolls to locate rare items. Warriors taken out of action
during the last battle may not look for rare items.


#### Selling

A player may trade in weapons and equipment at the same
time he buys new ones. After all, as warbands become more
powerful they often abandon their earlier armament in favour
of something better. However, the second-hand value of
equipment is not high due to the considerable wear and tear
inflicted on it by your warriors.
Warriors can automatically sell equipment for half its listed
price. In the case of rare equipment and weapons which have
a variable price, the warband receives half of the basic cost
only (merchants are far better at haggling than your warriors).
Alternatively, weapons, armor and equipment may be
hoarded for future use (make a note on the warband roster) or
swapped around the warband from one fighter to another
(though not between warbands). As a weapon’s value is low
compared to the cost of equipping any new recruits you may
get, a warband can usually find a use for its cast-off
armaments.



#### Price chart

The following chart indicates the cost of items available for sale at trading posts. The cost of rare items is included, but such items cannot
be bought unless they are available, as already described. In some cases the price is variable, and includes a basic cost plus a variable
extra amount, for example 20+3D6 gold crowns. For these items the extra variable cost reflects the rarity of the item – the premium
which must be paid to buy it.

#### Attack Animals

The most common attack animal in the Old World is the
faithful war house, especially favoured by Witch Hunters.
Other warbands have their favoured attack animals – Giant
Rats for Skaven, Dire Wolves for Vampires, Cold One Beast-
hounds for the Druchii. Whatever the differences between the
species, that a warrior with several sets of claws and jaws
behind him is a more dangerous opponent than a warrior on
his own.

Special Rules
Model: If you purchase an Attack Animal, it will fight exactly like a
member of your warband, though it is treated as part of the
equipment of the Hero who bought it. You will need a model to
represent it on a battlefield.
Experience: Attack Animals never gain experience, and if they are
put out of action they have exactly the same chance of recovering as
Henchmen (i.e., 1-2: Dead; 3-6: Alive). Attack Animal count
towards the maximum number of warriors allowed in your warband.

Bear
Bears are large animals often found in the forests of the Old World.
Normally they are peaceful creatures but when they feel threatened
they rip into their opponents with sharp deadly claws. Their strong
arms can wrap around a Warrior and slowly squeeze the life out of
him.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Black Bear 5 3 - 4 4 2 4 2 4
Grizzly Bear 5 3 - 5 5 2 3 3 4
Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Black Bear may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armor save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Bear out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Birds of Prey
Falcons and other birds of prey are much sort after by beast masters
as they are very useful for catching game and hindering opponents
by attacking weak spots such as the face and groin of enemy models.

Special Rules
Animal Companion: All Birds of Prey may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
Movement: A Bird of Prey can fight up to its Movement
away from it owner and will return before the end of the turn.
A Bird of Prey is never pinned in combat and may return
without having to break combat.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Bird of Prey out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.


Cave Squig
Part fungus and part flesh, these strange ferocious creatures are
almost all teeth, easily able to take a man’s leg off with a single bite.
[Greenskins Only]

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Cave Squig 2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5

Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Cave Squig may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
May Ride: A Goblin may ride the Cave Squig, if you are
using the optional rules for mounts. The Goblin gains +1
armor save, and shall move at the Cave Squig’s rate of 6".
Shooting attacks hit the Goblin on a die roll of 1-2, and the
Cave Squig on a 3-6. In close combat, the opponent may
choose which to hit. The Cave Squig no longer has to follow
the ‘Minderz’ rule (see below) if it is being ridden, as the
owning model is directing its actions.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
it owning model, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without the owning model within 6" at the
start of its Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point
on, move the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each
of its Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact
with another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model
in hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of
the player’s control until the end of the game.
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Cave Squig out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.

Chaos Hound
Some Warriors of Chaos control packs of snarling, vicious war
dogs. These creatures have been cruelly mutated by their exposure
to Chaos, and bear barbed tails, skeletal faces and sometimes extra
heads and limbs.

Cold One Beast-hound
(Dark Elves only)
The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. One such animal was
discovered in Lustria. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beast-hound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beast-hounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beast-hound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Beast-hound 6 3 0 4 4 1 1 1 4
Special Rules
Stupidity: Cold One Beast-hounds may use the basic
Leadership of it Master if they are within 6" of him.
Scaly Skin: Cold One Beast-hounds have tough scaly skin,
and are considered to have a 6+ armor save. This save
cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.
Fear: Cold One Beast-hounds cause Fear.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Cold One Beasthound out of
action gets a bonus +1 experience.


Familiar
Wizards are often solitary, usually shunned by those who can barely
conceive of, much less understand, the power these individuals
wield. As such, they often share their lives with animal companions,
rather than more ‘sentient’ beings. Sometimes a magical link will
develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent
that the wizard begins to see through the animal’s eyes, and hear its
thoughts. Wizards in different lands favour different types of
familiars, depending on their environment: Shadow Weavers tend to
favour darkly-coloured animals that can blend into the shadows
with them easily- ravens or darkly-coloured cats are most common.
Regardless of their form, familiars are actually not normal members
of their kind at all, but rather creatures that have somehow become
attuned to the Winds of Magic.
Familiars cannot actually be purchased as normal equipment.
The cost to ‘purchase’ a familiar actually represents the cost
of materials to cast the ritual to summon a familiar and form
a magical bond with it; the Rarity level represents the
chances of the ritual actually working. As such, the cost of
the familiar must always be paid if the rarity roll is attempted,
regardless of the success of the roll. Also, only Magic User
can attempt to ‘find’ a familiar. If a familiar is found, it
should be modelled on the Magic User as with any other
piece of equipment. A familiar may be placed on a separate
base (in fact many of the familiars that GW sells come this
way), but if this is done the familiar must always remain
within 6" of the Magic User, may and it may attack enemy
models or be attacked itself, other than the effect below.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Familiar 6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Options: The Familiar can be upgraded to one of the
following; Combat Familiar (+35 GC), Power Familiar (+45
GC) or Spell Familiar (+65 GC).
Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Familiars may be an Animal
Companion to a Magic User.
Re-roll: As long as the Familiar is within 1" of the Magic
User, the Magic User may re-roll one failed roll to cast a spell
each turn. The result of this re-roll must be accepted, even if
it fails.
Combat Familiar: As long as the Combat Familiar is within
1" of the Magic User, the Magic User’s Weapon Skill and
Attacks increases by 1. This may take the Magic User over
the Maximum.
Power Familiar: As long as the Power Familiar is within 1"
of the Magic User, the range of all Magic User Spell
increased by D6", roll for each spell when casted.
Spell Familiar: As long as the Spell Familiar is within 1" of
the Magic User, the Magic User may cast an extra Spell pre
turn.

Snotling
Snotlings are the smallest of the green-skinned races. They are not

little use for any real work.

War Hound

Special Rules
Poisoned Attack: Giant Spider attacks are poisoned – attacks

armor saves.
Wall Walk: Giant Spiders (and their riders) may walk up and
down walls without making Initiative tests. They may only
jump up to 2" across or down, but this does count as a diving
charge. When a spider jumps, its rider must make an
Initiative test; if this test is failed, something has gone wrong

- roll on the Whoa Boy! Table. Note even if the rider has the
Running Dismount skill, the maximum diving charge is only
2".
Note: Giant Spiders cannot be used in a warband that already
contains Giant Wolves.

Cockatrices
If it was not for the petrified bodies of its foes that surround it, the
Cockatrice would be a comical beast. It looks rather like a gigantic
and somewhat ragged cockerel. Its body is covered with a
haphazard mix of scales and feathers whilst its wings are leathery
and bat-like. The head that sits atop this bizarre combination is a
grotesque caricature of a proud bantam, with brilliant blood-red
wattles and a fearsomely sharp beak.

Harpies
The Harpies are jealously protective of the wyrdstone in their nest.
If any model approaches within their charge range then they will
charge. The Harpies will try and coordinate their attacks so at least
one stays back and protects the nest. Therefore, a Harpy may
disengage from a fallen enemy model if there is an opportunity for
one of its companions to charge another model.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Harpy 4 4 0 4 4 1 2 1 6
Special Rules:
Talons: A Harpy has talons and is accustomed to fighting
unarmed so does not suffer a penalty for doing so.
Fly: A Harpy may fly up to 12". After the Movement phase
the model is assumed to have landed and may be charged. If
on the ground, a Harpy may make a full move and then use
its wings.
Drop Attack: If a Harpy is successful with both attacks in
the first round of combat then the Harpy has successfully
grabbed on to her enemy and swoops back up in the air to
drop the model allowing gravity to do the work instead. The
attacks themselves do not wound, but the person controlling
the Harpy immediately rolls a D6 and a Scatter dice. That is
the distance and direction from the place where the attack
took place that the model will rest. Next the player
controlling the Harpy rolls another D6. This is the distance
from which the model has been dropped. The result is the
Strength of hit (Strength 1 to Strength 6). Normal falling
rules apply. If a model falls into a building than count the fall
to where they land and then determine if the model falls again
if it is within 1" of the edge of the floor. Any model that is
struck by the dropped model will suffer a S3 hit. Large
targets may only be dropped D3 inches since their size and
weight make them more difficult to pick up. Once its
opponent is dropped the Harpy may continue flying and
return to the nest, preparing for another attack. Models that
are stunned or knocked down will not be charged as it is too
difficult for the Harpy to fly that close to the ground and do a
drop attack.

damp hides. Renowned for their strength and unthinking ferocity,
Trolls can rip a man apart with their bare hands. Trolls are able to
regenerate damaged flesh, and so are all but impossible to kill. Not
only that, they have the ability to vomit the corrosive contents over
their victim, melting armor, flesh and bone with ease. One
particularly vicious form of Troll is the Stone Troll, whose hide is as
tough as rock. They have the strange ability of sucking the very
power of magic out of the surrounding area. River Trolls live in the

Ferocious Charge: Wild boars attack with +2S when

boar, not the rider.
Thick Skinned: The thick skin and matted fur of the boar
makes him very hard to wound. Boars confer an additional
+1 bonus to the rider’s Armor Save (making +2 total). If an
Orc Hero (not Henchmen) comes in contact with a boar he
may roll 2D6 to try and tame it. On a 10 or higher the boar
can be tamed and the boar will discharge D3 wyrdstone for
the Orc Hero. Sounds nasty, but Orcs don’t really care about
the smell. Anyway the Orc would make a Goblin or Snotling
clean off the wyrdstone for him.

Optional Rules

mutation, Roll a D6 for each shard eaten, on a 5+ the wild
boar begin to mutate Roll on the table below for the mutation

this to grapple its opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by
-1, down to a minimum of 1. The boar may choose which attack is
lost.
2 Blackblood: If the boar loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with it suffers a S3 hit (that will not cause a critical)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
3 Spines: Any model in base contact with the boar suffers an
automatic S1 hit at the beginning of each Close Combat phase.
Spines will never cause critical hits.

Bloodletters have red scaly hide and shiny black claws. These
daemonic creatures are furious fighters with strong arms and
murderous talons, but their most fearsome weapons are their
Hellblades. These weapons glow with deadly enchantment, and
cause terrible wounds that can slay the mightiest hero.

wear Hell-Forged Brass Armor (4+ Armor Save).
Special Rules
Hellblade: The Bloodletter is armed with a Hellblade which
will automatically cause a critical hit if a 4+ is rolled to hit.
Attacks: The Bloodletter has a number of Attacks equal to
the number of opponents it is fighting (down to a minimum
of 2 Attacks). It will split its attacks amongst the opponents,
and no matter how many warriors are involved it may roll to
hit each one at least once. It will also prevent an opponent
from taking any other warrior out of action in the massed
combat, as they will be too concerned with the Daemon to
finish off their other enemy!
Combat: As if drawn by the sounds of clash of steel, The
Bloodletter will seek out the nearest close combat and join in.
If there are no ongoing close combats within range, it will
charge the model with the highest Weapon Skill in order to
do battle with a worthy opponent. If there are no enemies
within charge range, the Daemon will run towards the nearest
warrior, eager to do battle.

Beast of Nurgle
The Beasts of Nurgle are gigantic and slug-like. Their heads are

them as they move, like that of a snail or slug, and carry all manner
of disfiguring and fatal diseases.

#### Undead

Undead Special Rules
All undead have the same basic rules that they follow:

cause fear.
Immune to Psychology: Undead are not affected by
psychology and never leave combat.
Immune to Poison: Undead are not affected by any poison.
May not run: Undead are slow undead creatures and may
not run (but may charge normally).

Banshee
A Banshee is a powerful Wraith, who wails constantly in battle. Her
wail brings only death and despair to those who hear it.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Banshee 8 3 0 3 4 2 3 2 8
Weapons/Armor: None
Special rules:
Body: Once the Banshee’s wound is Reduced to 0 it is
automatically out of action.
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Ghostly Howl: A Banshee is capable of emitting an eerie
howl that brings death to mortals. Even the distant shriek of a
banshee is enough to strike horror into the hearts of the
bravest man, but anyone hearing the constant wail of a
Banshee will almost certainly die of sheer fright.
The Ghostly Howl of a Banshee is used in the Shooting
phase. A Banshee may use it even if engaged in hand to hand
combat, but only against the model(s) it is fighting. The
attack has a range of 8". The Banshee can target any model
within range and does not need line of sight to the model.
Roll 2D6+2 and deduct the Leadership value of the model.
For each point by which the roll beats the target’s leadership,
the target suffers one wound.
Experience

+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Ghost out of action gets a bonus +1

Ghosts
Made by McAber (Mats Carlsson), with input from the
Mordheim E-group list, especially David Stillberg.
Mordheim has many ghosts. Several that died with unfinished
business now roam the desolate streets in futile attempts to find
peace for their restless souls. Most of them are bound to specific
locations in the city, haunting burnt out buildings and ruins. Many
of the ghosts cannot do more than moan, groan and cause dread in
general. Even the more active ghosts most of the time pose no great
threat to the living. The ghost can emit a shriek that pierces the ears
and souls of the living. It will force fainthearted to run in terror
from the ghost, and make the more hardened warriors to shield their
ears and stumble away. The ghost also can draw the life-force from
a victim by touching them, but this is a fairly slow process. These
attacks are mostly non-lethal, sometimes a victim can stumble over
a ledge when fleeing from a shrieking ghost and fall to their death,
but most of the time it is enough to get away from the haunted
building to be safe.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ghost 5 3 0 0 3 2 1 2 7
Weapons: Shriek, Cold touch, Cannot use any equipment.
Special rules
Haunt: Must be deployed within a building or ruin anywhere
on the playing field not occupied by an enemy model. Cannot
venture further than 5" from any building or ruin. (So it can
move between buildings if they are not more than 10" apart.)
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Shriek: The ghost emits a soul (and ear) piercing shriek
affecting all living models (for example ghouls, dregs and
necromancers) in a 3" radius. They have to take a Ld test. If
the result is equal to or lower than the model's T, it is
unaffected altogether. If it is higher than the models T, but
not higher than it's Ld, the model staggers d3" directly from
the Ghost, clasping it's hand to it's ears. If the result is higher
than the model's Ld, it breaks and flees, just as if it failed a
Fear test. Models immune to Psychology don't break, but
staggers 1d6" instead. Only one Shriek can be made per turn,
but every extra attack spent shrieking gives +1 on the Ld roll.
Cold touch: The ghost reaches inside the enemy and touches
his inner being (it can be the soul, life-force or whatever is in
there). The ghost uses Ld instead of S to wound, and the
victim uses Ld instead of T to withstand the hit. The victim
has no armor save. Instead of causing a wound it lowers the
Toughness by 1 for the rest of the battle (accumulative). If T
reaches 0 roll on the injury table with +2 on the roll.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Ghost.

Young Giants
Giants are said to be forged from the earth itself. They are powerful
creatures given to rage easily and often rampage throughout the
land to deter would be adventurer. Most of the larger Giants
slumber in caves and are seldom ever seen by the eyes of man. Some
of the younger, more naive beasts are given to sleeping in the open
however, prey to monster hunters and thieves, which is of course if
the young Giant does not wake.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Young Giant 6 3 0 5 5 4 2 3 8
SPECIAL RULES
Slumbering Brute: The Young Giant is initially sleeping. In
each player’s recovery phase roll a D6, on a roll of 6 the
Young Giant awakes (add +1 to the roll for each model
within 2" of the beast, it instantly awakens if attacked). The
Giant’s turn is always before the player’s who woke it. It will
always move towards the nearest model, charging if possible
but will not attack a Truthsayer or Dark Emissary due to their
close affiliation.
Fear: Huge and obese the Young Giant causes Fear.
Enraged: Waking from its slumber the Young Giant is very
mad and will therefore not Rout for any reason.
Thick-headed: The Young Giant’s skull is as thick as a rock
and as such it can never be stunned, treat any stunned results
as knocked down instead.
Ungainly: If a Young Giant is knocked down roll a scatter
dice to determine the direction it falls in, then place the
model on its back. Any model underneath the Giant must
pass an Immediate initiative test or suffer a strength 5 hit as
the brute crushes them. The Young Giant automatically picks
itself up next turn.
Rampage: When the Young Giant attacks it is a rampage of
varied assaults. Roll a D6 to determine what it does.
1-2 Swipe. Attacks as normal.
3-4 Stomp. Makes a single attack at Strength 7 inflicting
double wounds.

Young Hydra
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Young Hydra 6 3 0 4 4 5 3 5 8
Special Rules
Fear: Despite its smaller size, the young Hydra is still a
fearsome opponent. It causes fear.
Save: The young Hydra’s scales aren’t as strong as a normal
Hydra’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The Hydra has
an armor save of 6+ that is not modified by the strength of
attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Hydra breathes, flames
leap from its mouths. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase and may be
made even if the Hydra is involved in close combat. Simply
place the small teardrop shaped template with the narrow end
at one of the Hydra’s mouths; any models under the template
will be hit by flames on a dice roll of 4+. A model hit by
flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal armor saves apply. Do
not worry about any buildings the template may cover; the
Hydra’s fire is too weak to set them alight without prolonged
exposure.
Loss of Heads: Each wound suffered by a Hydra represents
one of its many heads getting taken out of action. Because of
this, any successful (unsaved and un-regenerated) Wound to a
Hydra reduces its Attacks characteristic by one. In addition,
the loss of heads makes for fewer flames when it breathes, so
for every 2 successful Wounds, the strength of the Hydra’s
breath weapon is reduced by one (to a minimum Strength of
1). So, for example, if the Hydra has taken 3 (unsaved and
unregenerated) Wounds, it would have 2 attacks remaining
and the Strength of its breath weapon would be reduced to 2.
Regeneration: All Hydras have the ability to regrow
damaged heads. Some can do this immediately, while for
others it may take a matter of hours or even days to replace a
head that is lost. To represent this ability, at the end of each
round of close combat roll a D6 for each Wound the Hydra
has suffered that round. On a roll of 4 or more that Wound
has regenerated; any regenerated Wounds are reinstated. If a
Hydra is down to its last Wound remaining, make this roll to
regenerate before rolling on the Injury table; a successful
Regenerate roll means that no Injury roll is made.
Will not Rout: The Hydra is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its
lair for any reason.
Skull of Iron: The Hydra’s skulls are much too thick for
normal blows to penetrate. It is immune to the effects of
being stunned. Treat any stunned results from the Injury table
as a knocked down result instead (see below).
Staggered, but not down: Mighty blows will rock the Hydra
but most creatures lack the ability to truly knock it into the
dirt. Therefore, any knocked down result the Hydra receives
will instead cause it to lose 1 Attack until it recovers (during
the Recovery phase of its next turn). Multiple knocked down
results will cause it to lose multiple attacks in this way (if
taken to 0 Attacks or fewer, the Hydra may not attack until it
recovers).

Experience
+1 For wounding the Monster. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Young
Hydra.
+2 For taking the Monster out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Young Hydra out of action gets a

Dragon has an Armor save of 5+ that is not modified by the
strength of attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Dragon breathes, flames
leap from its mouth. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase, and may
be made even if the Dragon is involved in close combat.
Simply place the small teardrop shaped template supplied
opposite with the narrow end at the Dragon’s mouth. Any
models under the template will be hit by flames on a dice roll
of 4+. A model hit by flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal
armor saves apply. Do not worry about any buildings the
template may cover; the Dragon’s fire is too weak to set them
alight without prolonged exposure.
Will not Rout: The Dragon is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its

Envenomed Tail: The Wyvern has a whip-like tail that is
tipped with a deadly stinger. In combat it thrashes this tail
forward among its enemies, either injecting them with its
deadly venom, or simply clubbing them into submission. In
game terms this is represented by a special tail strike that the
Wyvern makes before its normal attacks in close combat.
Roll a D6. Any enemy models that are in base contact with
the Wyvern and that it may attack in the Close Combat phase
(e.g., it is either the Wyvern’s ‘turn’ or the model’s turn) that
have a lower Initiative than the dice score are automatically
hit by the Wyvern’s tail. Models with Initiative equal to or
higher than the D6 roll have successfully dodged the tail and
are not affected. Each model struck by the Wyvern’s tail
takes a Strength 4 hit.
Will not Rout: The Wyvern is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its
lair for any reason.
Skull of Iron: The Wyvern’s skull is much too thick for
normal blows to penetrate. It is immune to the effects of
being stunned. Treat any stunned results from the Injury table
as a knocked down result instead (see below).
Staggered, but not down: Mighty blows will rock the
Wyvern, but most creatures lack the ability to truly knock it
into the dirt. Therefore, any knocked down result the Wyvern
receives will instead cause it to lose 1 Attack until it recovers
(during the Recovery phase of its next turn). Multiple
knocked down results will cause it to lose multiple attacks in
this way (if taken to 0 Attacks or fewer, the Wyvern may not
attack until it recovers).
Experience
+1 For wounding the Monster. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Young
Wyvern.
+2 For taking the Monster out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Young Wyvern out of action gets a
bonus +2 experience.

additional -1 penalty to his armor save, for a total armor
save penalty of -3 (-1 for the bite and -2 for Strength).

Dragon Head: One of the Chimera’s three heads is that of a
Dragon. When the Dragon head breathes, flames leap from its
mouth. It can use these flames as a weapon if it wishes. This
attack is made in the Shooting phase. Simply place the small
teardrop shaped template with the narrow end at the Dragon
head’s mouth; any models under the template will be hit by
flames on a dice roll of 4+. A model hit by flames takes a S3
hit. Normal armor saves apply. Do not worry about any
buildings the template may cover; the Chimera’s fire is too
weak to set them alight without prolonged exposure.
Will not Rout: The Hippogriff is far too greedy to abandon
its hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its

as a knocked down result instead (see below).

Ram Head: The second head is that of a massive bloody-
eyed ram. One of the Chimera’s attacks is a head-butt made
by the ram head. If this attack hits but fails to do damage, the
target must make an Initiative test or be knocked down.
Staggered, but not down: Mighty blows will rock the
Hippogriff but most creatures lack the ability to truly knock it
into the dirt. Therefore, any knocked down result the
Hippogriff receives will instead cause it to lose 1 Attack until
it recovers (during the Recovery phase of its next turn).
Multiple knocked down results will cause it to lose multiple
attacks in this way.

Lion Head: The last of the Chimera’s heads is that of a
ferocious golden-maned lion with jaws of steel and razor-
sharp teeth. One of the Chimera’s attacks is a bite by the lion
head. An opponent damaged by this attack suffers an
additional -1 penalty to his armor save, for a total armor
save penalty of -3 (-1 for the bite and -2 for Strength).
Will not Rout: The Chimera is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
