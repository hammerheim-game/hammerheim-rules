# Weapons & Equipment
</div>

Life and death in Mordheim is decided by the quantity and quality of the weapons a warrior carries. While many warbands have access to unique items (as listed in their relevant sections) this chapter defines what the mundane items in Mordheim do. 
## Close Combat Weapons

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Axe

_The axe is quite possibly the most essential weapon a warband can own. Their uses in logging and craft make them truly abundant as tools, and the weight that can be put behind each strike makes them adept at hacking through raised shields or heavy armour._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing:** The enemy's armour save is reduced by an additional 1 against wounds caused by Axes (eg, 4+ becomes 5+).


### Beastlash

_A Beastlash is a particularly cruel type of whip with a ring of barbs at its tip, designed to entangle with fur when striking and tearing a chunk away as part of the whipcrack. Wounds on beasts caused by these weapons are exceptionally painful for the poor animals on the recieving end, and their use is sadly so widespread that most animals have learned to fear them._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Cannot be Parried**   
**Whipcrack:** In the first round of combat the user may make a special additional _Whipcrack_ attack. This is resolved before any blows are struck, but after Impact Hits. Once Whipcrack is resolved, the combat continues as normal. 
** Beastbane:** Causes _Fear_ in animals.
```
```

### Dagger

_Nobody leaves home without a Dagger in the Old World - nobody. A small kitchen knife, a piece of glass tied to a stick, or a more ornate assassin's blade: They are all short and easily concealled weapons, and while poorly suited to hand-to-hand combat they are a last means of defence in a dangerous world._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Poor Penetration:** Daggers are ineffective at punturing anything beyond soft tissue. Opponents gain +1 to their usual armour save against wounds caused by daggers (eg, 5+ becomes 4+).



### Double-Handed Weapon

_A blow from a double-handed axe or sword can cut a foe in half and
break armour apart. It takes a long time to learn how to use these
weapons and even then only the extremely strong are able to wield
them effectively._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +2    
>##### Special Rules:
**Extremely Slow:** Warriors using a Double-Handed weapon will always strike last in combat regardless of charging or initiative. 

### Dwarf Axe

_Dwarf axes are smaller-hafted weapons made of lighter (but
stronger) materials than normal axes. Dwarf Warriors are specially
trained in their use and are able to use them as deftly as a Human
warrior might wield a sword._


> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Armour Piercing:** See Axes   
**Parry**


\page

### Fists

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


_The truly desperate, who don’t even own a knife, have to fight with
their bare hands. Against the vast array of beasts and monsters that one might encounter in Mordheim a totally unarmed warrior's chance of survival is extremely low.
Note: The following rule only apply to warriors who have lost their
weapons. Creatures such as Zombies, animals, etc, ignore these
rules._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User -1    
>##### Special Rules:
**Poor Penetration:** See Daggers


### Flail

_The flail is a heavy weapon wielded with both hands. It normally
consists of heavy weights, often spiked, attached to a pole or handle
by means of heavy chains. Flails drain the user’s stamina quickly,
but are awesomely destructive in the hands of a skilled (or
unhinged) warrior._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +2    
>##### Special Rules:
**Requires two Hands**  
**Tiring:** The Strength bonus from the Flail only lasts for the first round of any combat. If a warrior leaves combat then they will regain the Flail's strength bonus in the start of their next combat.

### Halberd

_Halberds are slightly shorter than spears, but bear a curved axehead upon their tips. This grants them incredible versatility, as a warrior can use its weight to stab at range or deliver devestating overhead chops. They are cheap and easy to manufacture, and have become a staple of every Empire regiment without exception._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +1    
>##### Special Rules:
**Requires two Hands**  
```
```

### Hammer, Staff, Mace, Club, etc.

_Perhaps the simplest type of weapon, these brutal, bludgeoning
instruments range from primitive wooden clubs to elaborately
forged Dwarf hammers made from the finest steel. A blow from a
mace can easily crush a skull or knock a man unconscious._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Concussive:** When rolling for Injury Rolls inflicted with a Club, the opponent will be stunned on 2-4 rather than the normal 3-4.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


### Lance

_Lances are long, heavy spears used by mounted shock troops to rip
through armour and fling their foes to the ground. They are the
chosen weapons of Knights Templar and other wealthy warriors. To
use a lance requires great skill and strength, and only the richest
warriors ride the heavy warhorses needed to wield these mighty
weapons effectively._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +2    
>##### Special Rules:
**Cavalry Weapon:** Only mounted models may use a Lance, as they are far too unwieldy and require too much forward momentum to use on foot. 
**Charge Bonus:** The Strength Bonus of the Lance only applies in the turn in which you charged. After that the strength bonus is lost, just as with a Flail.   
**Unwieldy:** See Morningstars or Spears.

### Morningstar

_A morningstar consists of a wooden or steel shaft topped with heavy chains
that have spiked steel balls attached. It is very destructive and
requires great skill to wield effectively._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +1    
>##### Special Rules:   
**Unwieldy:** While a Morningstar may be used in one hand it requires a Warrior's full attention to use. It may not be combined with a second weapon, though may be combined with a shield.


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Scythe

_Scythes are normally implements used in the fields by farmers. It is
rare to see them wielded as weapons of warfare however, as their enormous curved blades are as much a danger to the wielder's allies as they are to the enemy._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Reaping:** Warriors using a Scythe must allocate all their attacks to a single foe, and resolve those attacks as normal. Additionally, all other models in base contact (friend or foe!) recieve one extra attack from the wielder.   
**Requires Two Hands**

### Spear (On Foot)

_Spears were arguably the first revolution in warfare, allowing therwise small and frail warriors the reach to combat the larger monsters of the world, as well as allowing their opponent's weight to work against them as they throw their mass upon their tips._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Anti-Large:** Spears gain +1 To Hit, and +1 To Wound against larger foes. 
**Unwieldy:** While a Spear may be used in one hand it requires a Warrior's full attention to use. It may not be combined with a second weapon, though may be combined with a shield.

### Spear (On Mount)

_While the more well-financed and glittering Knights of The Old World favour the heroic and iconic Lances, Spears are far easier to manufacture and serve largely the same role. They are a staple of lighter cavalry around the globe, though do not deliver such a staggering impact._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User +1    
>##### Special Rules:
**Charge Bonus:** The Strength Bonus of the Spear only applies in the turn in which you charged. After that the strength bonus is lost, just as with a Flail.   
**Unwieldy:** While a Spear may be used in one hand it requires a Warrior's full attention to use. It may not be combined with a second weapon, though may be combined with a shield.

```
```
### Sword

_The sword is often referred to as the ‘king of weapons’, the most commonly manufactured weapon in The Old World. Its designs will vary wildly from warband to warband - from the Broadswords of the Empire to the crude, blunt machettes of the Greenskins. In either case these lightweight weapons provide an excellent balance of offence and defence._

> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Parry** 



### Whip


> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; ** Strength:** As User   
>##### Special Rules:
**Cannot be Parried**   
**Whipcrack:** In the first round of combat the user may make a special additional _Whipcrack_ attack. This is resolved before any blows are struck, but after Impact Hits. Once Whipcrack is resolved, the combat continues as normal. 


## Special Weapon Types

Special Weapon Types are enhancements to the usual types of weapon that are found in Mordheim, and are typically the sign of a master artisan's work. Weapons forged with one of these Special Weapon Types retain all their usual properties, but will gain the additional benefits as listed below (for example, a Dark Steel Sword will still be able to parry, but it will now gain the Critical Wounds special ability). A weapon may only have one type of forging in this way, and Daggers may never be specially forged. No elevated smithy would waste their time with such a puny weapon!


### Dark Steel Weapons

_Dark Steel Weapons are forged in the city of Hag Graef, the Dark
Crag. They are fashioned from Black Iron, a rare metal
found deep within the mountains around the city. Dark Steel
weapons have wicked protrusions and serrated edges, which inflict grevious wounds on an opponent._

##### Special Rules 
**Critical Wounds:** Dark Steel weapons gain +2 to their rolls to determine the type of Critical Hit they inflict, should they inflict one.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Gromril Weapons

_Only a Dwarf Runesmith can forge a weapon from Gromril, a rare
meteoric iron. A blade fashioned from this metal will stay keen for a
thousand years._
##### Special Rules
**Keen Edge:** Gromril Weapons gain the Armour Piercing special rule. If the weapon already had Armour Piercing, then they reduce armour by 2 points rather than the usual 1.

### Ithilmar Weapons

_Elven blades are forged from priceless Ithilmar, an extremely light
but strong metal, found only in the fabled Elven kingdoms. A few of
these weapons are occasionally found in the Old World and these
are normally spoils of war, taken by the Norse raiders who pillage
the coastal settlements of the Elves._

##### Special Rules
**Effortless:** Ithilmar Weapons gain +1 on their To Hit rolls.

## Missile Weapons

### Bow

_The bow is carried by most races and used extensively in warfare, as well as hunting. It
is a compact yet powerful weapon, that is cheap to make and easy to
maintain._

> **Range:** 24"; **Strength:** 3

### Crossbow Pistol

_Crossbow pistols are masterpieces made by expert weapon-smiths.
They are miniature crossbows with all the power and accuracy of
the real thing. As these weapons may be easily concealed, they are
the favoured weapon of assassins._


> **Range:** 10"; ** Strength:** 3  
>##### Special Rules:   
**Snap-shot:** In the first round of any close combat a Crossbow Pistol may be fired in the same way as a Whipcrack - striking before any blows are struck, but after Impact Hits. It will roll to hit using Ballistic Skill.

```
```

### Crossbow
_A crossbow consists of a short, strong bow-stave mounted on a
wooden or steel stock. The crossbows of the Empire are made of
steel and often include a winding mechanism to draw back the
string. It takes a long time to prepare a crossbow, but a bolt fired
from one has a tremendous range and can penetrate armour easily.
Crossbows take much longer than other bows to make, so they are
expensive and relatively rare weapons. Still, they are the preferred
weapon of many in Mordheim because of their power and long
range._

> **Range:** 30"; ** Strength:** 4  
>##### Special Rules:
**Move or Fire:** Warriors that have moved, or stood up in that turn's recovery phase, may not shoot in the same turn.

### Elf Bow

_Elven bows are the finest missile weapons of their kind. Constructed
from Ithilmar or wood from the Elf forests, with strings woven from
the hair of Elf maidens, Elven bows are far superior to any missile
weapons made by other races. In the hands of an Elven archer, the
Elf bow is a truly potent weapon, its long range and penetrating
power making it far superior to any bow made by humans._

> **Range:** 36"; ** Strength:** 3  
>##### Special Rules:
**Armour Piercing:** See Axes.

### Javelins

_Javelins are small and lightweight throwing spears favoured typically in nations where string is difficult to acquire. They have become the favoured hunting weapons of Norscans, though also see some use by cavalry._

> **Range:** 12"; ** Strength:** As User    
>##### Special Rules:
**Thrown Weapon:** Thrown Weapons do not suffer the usual 'To Hit' penalties for range, or for moving and shooting.



#### Longbow

_A long bow is made of alternating layers of either yew or elm. A
skilled archer can hit a chosen leaf on a tree from three hundred
paces with this weapon. The long bow is favoured by experienced
archers due to its great reach and accuracy._

> **Range:** 30"; ** Strength:** 3
\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

#### Repeater Crossbow

_Repeater crossbows are extremely complex devices, expensive to
acquire and difficult to make. While this makes them rare, they
certainly have their uses: they can rain a deadly hail of bolts on
enemies, and a warrior using one may move quite fast and still fire
his weapon._

> **Range:** 24"; ** Strength:** 3
>##### Special Rules
**Multiple Shots (2):** After choosing your target to shoot as usual, roll two 'To Hit' dice rather than the usual one - then resolve as normal. These shots must target the same opponent, and suffer a -1 'To Hit' penalty.


### Shortbow

_Short bows are small, short-ranged bows that are cheap and require
little strength to use. Some cavalry carry a shortened bow which is
easier to shoot from horseback than a larger bow. Halflings also use
short bows, as they lack the strength and height required to use a
longbow._

> **Range:** 16"; ** Strength:** 3


### Sling

_Slings are rarely used, mainly because they are no more powerful
than bows and have a shorter range. A sling is little more than a
looped strip of cloth or leather into which a stone is placed. The
sling is whirled about the slinger’s head and the sling stone is then
released towards the target. While this weapon is looked down upon
by most archers, a skilled slinger can slay a man from a
considerable distance, and the ammunition is easy to find: rocks are
everywhere and free!_

> **Range:** 18"; ** Strength:** 2
>##### Special Rules
**Multiple Shots (2):** After choosing your target to shoot as usual, roll two 'To Hit' dice rather than the usual one - then resolve as normal. These shots must target the same opponent, and suffer a -1 'To Hit' penalty.

```
```
### Throwing Knives/Axes

_Throwing knives or axes are specially weighted and lightweight weapons that are designed to rotate forwards when thrown, allowing them to penetrate targets rather than bounce sideways from them. Due to their delicate nature and size they are unsuited for close quarters combat however._

> **Range:** 6"; ** Strength:** As User
>##### Special Rules
**Thrown Weapon:** Thrown Weapons do not suffer the usual 'To Hit' penalties for range, or for moving and shooting.

## Missile Weapon Upgrades
Missile Weapons Upgrades function in exactly the same way as Special Weapons Types, though only apply to Bows, Crossbows, Shortbows, Longbows, or Elf Bows. Other weapons are just too specialised to be customised in this way!

### Black Arrow
_Black Arrows are a secret only known to a few, forged from the ichor released from the Black Roach - a unique type of insect found only in Mordheim. This ichor is a potent neurotoxin, utterly incapacitating any who come into contact with it._ 
(One Use Per Battle)    
Any injury rolls from
the Black Arrow are automatically considered a 6. Has no effect upon targets that are _Immune to Poison_.

### Composite / Compound

A compound or composite weapon uses different materials and a unique shape to increase its power. Weapons suitable for Missile Weapon Upgrades may be purchased as a
Compound version, costing twice their usual amount. Compound weapons shoot 50% further and use the
strength of their user instead of its normal Strength.

#### Fire Arrows

_Fire arrows are tied with rags soaked in oil up in a tight
pouch that explodes bunched up in a tight pouch that
explodes when hitting the target, setting clothes and
equipment alight._  
Weapons with Fire Arrows gain the _Flaming Attacks_ special rule. Additionally they get the following special rule: 
**Ignition!:** Whether wounded or not, if you hit a warrior you must roll a D6. On the result of a 4+ they are ignited! At the start of each of their Recovery Phases they may roll a D6 to extinguish the flames - on a 4+ they succeed and suffer no further effects. If failed then they take an automatic Strength 4 hit with _Flaming Attacks_ and remain Ignited. Allies in base contact with the Ignited warrior may attempt to help to pat down the flames (assuming they are not also Ignited!) by rolling their own D6 in the same way.


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Hunting Arrows

_The best hunting arrows are made by the hunters of Drakwald
forest. They have sharp, barbed arrowheads which cause
excruciating pain when they hit their target. A skilled archer can
severely injure their target with a single arrow, and their removal is a long and often deadly process._    
Wounds inflicted by Hunting Arrows gain +1 to their Injury Rolls.



## Blackpowder Weapons



### Blunderbuss

_A blunderbuss is a primitive Blackpowder weapon, which fires a
hail of lead balls, rusty bolts, bent nails, and other assorted scrap
metal. It is a powerful, if erratic, weapon and takes such a long time
to load that most warriors discard it after the first shot._


> **Range:** special; ** Strength:** 3
>##### Special Rules
**Scattershot:** To fire the Blunderbuss, place the Flame Template with its narrow end touching the firer. All models under the template are hit. May not target models in combat with your own warriors.   
**One Shot Per Battle:** It takes a long time to gather the spoons, stones, pebbles, and detritus needed to load a Blunderbuss. They may only be fired once per battle.

### Duelling Pistol

_A duelling pistol is a work of art, and a gunsmith labours long and
hard to produce a single example. They are often carried by
Imperial nobles to solve disputes over love and honour, and many a
noble has died at dawn in a duel over some grievance. Duelling pistols are prohibitively expensive weapons and common
warriors rarely have them. Even if they do manage to steal or buy
one, the ammunition is  also very expensive.
Some of the wealthiest warriors in Mordheim carry duelling pistols
as status symbols, commanding great respect, admiration and envy._

> **Range:** 12"; ** Strength:** 4
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing** 
**Accurate:** All "To Hit" rolls made with Duelling Pistols are at +1 To Hit.   
**Point Blank:** In the first round of any Close Combat, the wielder of a Pistol may sacrifice one of their Attacks to instead attempt a Point Blank shot. Resolve this shot using the warrior's Weapon Skill as normal, but use the Pistol's strength and Armour Piercing. This Point Blank shot may not be used again until the warrior leaves combat, as they need time to reload!   
**Brace of Pistols:** Warriors with a Brace of Pistols may sacrifice two attacks to instead make two Point Blank Shots.

```
```

### Handgun

_A handgun is a simple firearm. The quality of construction varies
ranging from the crude wooden ‘hakbuts’ of the artillery school of
Nuln, to the more sophisticated Dwarf firearms that have levers and
springs which hold the burning match, and triggers which release
the firing mechanism and fire the gun. Handguns are not terribly
reliable weapons: the gun barrel occasionally tends to explode
violently or the powder fails to ignite. But the weapon has a great
range and tremendous penetrating power, making a mockery of even
the thickest armour. In Mordheim, handguns are rare and
expensive, but a warband which can boast such a weapon will
command respect from all its rivals._

> **Range:** 24"; ** Strength:** 4
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing** 
**Move or Fire:** See Crossbows

#### Hochland Long Hunting Rifle

_Hochland is a province famed for its hunters, and the preferred
weapon of its nobility when they go hunting is a long-ranged rifle.
They are extremely rare and precious weapons, and only the most
experienced weapon smiths are capable of manufacturing them._

> **Range:** 48"; ** Strength:** 4
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing** 
**Sniper**  
**Move or Fire:** See Crossbows


### Pistol

A pistol is a small, simple Blackpowder weapon fired by a spring
mechanism. Most pistols are expensive, unreliable, and poorly
constructed.

> **Range:** 8; ** Strength:** 4
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing** 
**Point Blank:** In the first round of any Close Combat, the wielder of a Pistol may sacrifice one of their Attacks to instead attempt a Point Blank shot. Resolve this shot using the warrior's Weapon Skill as normal, but use the Pistol's strength and Armour Piercing. This Point Blank shot may not be used again until the warrior leaves combat, as they need time to reload!   
**Brace of Pistols:** Warriors with a Brace of Pistols may sacrifice two attacks to instead make two Point Blank Shots.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Warplock Pistol

_Warplock pistols are terrifying weapons, testimony to the mad
genius of Clan Skryre engineers. Warplock pistols shoot ammunition
made of magically treated warpstone and wounds caused by
Warplock pistols are horrible to behold and often cause infections._

_[Skaven Only]_


> **Range:** 8; ** Strength:** 5
>##### Special Rules
**Armour Piercing** 
**Point Blank:** In the first round of any Close Combat, the wielder of a Pistol may sacrifice one of their Attacks to instead attempt a Point Blank shot. Resolve this shot using the warrior's Weapon Skill as normal, but use the Pistol's strength and Armour Piercing. This Point Blank shot may not be used again until the warrior leaves combat, as they need time to reload!   
**Brace of Pistols:** Warriors with a Brace of Pistols may sacrifice two attacks to instead make two Point Blank Shots.

## Blackpowder Weapons Upgrades

### Bayonet

Only Hochland Hunting Rifles, Nuln Shotguns, or Handguns may be affixed with a Bayonet.     
Weapons affixed with this upgrade behave as a Spear in combat.

### Double-barrelled

_Knowing Ostlanders’ penchant for impressive weaponry (and ready
willingness to spend excessive amounts of money) a Weaponsmith
from Hochland decided to weld two barrels together on a pistol and
sell it for twice the price. The Warband was so impressed with their
new weapon that they asked him to do the same to their hunting
rifle. Since then the Weaponsmith has been flooded with orders from
some of the most powerful Warbands in Mordheim._    
Only Hochland Hunting Rifles, Nuln Shotguns, Handguns, and Pistols (all subclasses) may be Double-Barrelled.    
Double Barrelled weapons gain Multiple Wounds (2).



### Heavier Ammunition
(One Use per Battle)    
Heavier Ammunition is a special round; it may use Nickel or some
other heaver metal for the shot.
Heavier Ammunition increases the strength of a single shot by 1. May not be
used on siege weapons.

```
```
### Modified Gunsight

Gunsmiths are known for their innovative approach to battlefield
invention. A modified gunsight is simply the sight from a Hochland
Long rifle that has been altered to fit some other blackpowder
weapon. Only blackpowder weapons that roll a conventional 'to hit'
dice may be fitted with a Modified Gunsight, and the Gunsight adds
50% to whatever your weapon's usual range is.

### Silver Bullets
Silver has always been rumoured to be the bane of evil creatures.
Gunsmiths are able to cast ammunition from silver, for use in any
black powder weapons (other than siege weapons).
Firearms using silver bullets gain a +1 bonus to wound against undead, daemons, and Possessed.

### Superior Blackpowder

The model has acquired a better quality of blackpowder than
is normally available. This new batch adds +1 Strength to all
blackpowder weapons that the model has. There is enough
superior blackpowder to last for one game, after which it is consumed.

## Armour & Clothing

When fighting in close combat, a good suit of armour may mean the difference between life and death. The finest armour
in the known world is made in Dwarf forges, where the secrets of steel and fire are well understood. Hardened leather
jackets are often worn by the hunters of Osterland, while city soldiers prefer mail coats and steel breastplates. In Mordheim, only the most wealthy and powerful are able to afford the luxury of owning a suit of armour (the less well-off
have to make do with leather tunics and occasionally helmets and wooden shields). The richest leaders of the most
successful warbands wear suits of high quality armour and a good suit of armour is just as much a symbol of wealth and
power as it is protection against weapons.

### Barding

Barding is armour for a horse in the same way that light and heavy
armour is for a human. It covers the mount’s hide and in some cases
the head.


A model mounted on barded horse receives an additional +1
Armour save (+2 instead of +1 for being mounted).

### Buckler

Bucklers are held in a Warrior's hand in the place of one of their weapons. They increase the wearer's Armour Save by 1, and have the Parry special rule.

### Cathayan Silk Clothes

_Some rich warband leaders like to flaunt their wealth and purchase
clothes made out of silk from distant Cathay. This silk is the most
expensive fabric in the known world, and wearing such clothes is a
sure way to attract attention!_ 
Any warband whose leader is wearing silk clothes
may re-roll the first failed Rout test. However, after each
battle in which the leader is taken out of action, roll a D6. On
a roll of 1-2 the clothes are ruined and must be discarded.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Dark Steel Armour

_Dark Steel is a surprisingly lightweight compound metal with a famously blackened tint. Few races know better than the Dark Elves how to strike lethal blows, and suits of their armour are often fashioned to grant disproportionate protection to vital joints such as the groin, armpits, and throat. While tremendously expensive, no Druchii warlord should ever go without one for there is no better protection against an unseen Assassin's blade._    
**Save:** Dark Steel armour gives the wearer a 5+ basic save,
and does not slow them down if he is also armed with a shield.  
**Vital Guard:** The wearer's armour save may never be completely ignored due to a critical hit. 

### Elven Cloak

_Made from the hair of Elven maidens and interwoven with living
tree leaves, an Elven cloak is a wonder to behold. A warrior
wearing such a cloak will blend into the shadows, making it very
difficult to shoot at them with missile weapons. Elven cloaks rarely
come up for sale, but are sometimes recovered from dead warriors
or offered by Elves as rewards to men who have served them in
some way._  
A warrior aiming a missile weapon at a warrior wearing an
Elven cloak suffers -1 on their to hit roll.



### Forest Cloak


Forest Cloaks behave in the same way as Elven Cloaks, but are much less ornate and decorative. 

### Gromril Armour

_Gromril is the rarest and strongest metal known in the Old
World. Only a very few Dwarf smiths know the secret of forging
Gromril, and a suit of armour made from it fetches a huge price._   
**Save:** Gromril armour gives the wearer a 4+ basic save, and
does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.

### Heavy Armour

_Typical heavy armour is made from metal links and is called chain
mail. Forging chain mail is a laborious and time consuming
process, as the blacksmith must put together hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of metal links. This makes chain mail expensive, but this
type of armour provides excellent protection for anyone who can
afford it.
There are other types of heavy armour as well, of which the best
known are the steel breastplates and greaves worn by the foot
knights of the Templar orders._ 
**Save:** A warrior that is wearing heavy armour has a basic D6
saving throw of 5+. 
**Movement:** A warrior that is armed with both heavy armour
and a shield suffers a -1 Movement penalty.

```
```
### Helmet

_From the shining steel helmets of Bretonnian knights to the
leather caps of the Skaven, all sensible warriors try to protect
the most vulnerable part of their body – their head. Even the
most vain fighters still use a helmet, as it can be festooned
with plumes, horns and other decorations. Helmets come in
varying shapes and sizes, but their basic function remains the
same._  
**Avoid Stun:** A model that is equipped with a helmet has a
special 4+ save on a D6 against being stunned. If the save is
made, treat the stunned result as knocked down instead. This
save is not modified by the opponent’s Strength.

### Ithilmar Armour

_Ithilmar is a silvery metal which is as light as silk and stronger than
steel. Elves are experts at fashioning weapons and armour from
Ithilmar, and the Elven kingdom of Caledor is the only place in the
world where this metal can be found._   
**Save:** Ithilmar armour gives the wearer a 5+ basic save, and
does not slow them down if they are also armed with a shield.   
**Lightweight:** Models equipped with Ithilmar Armour may re-roll failed Initiative tests when climbing or jumping.

### Light Armour

_Light armour encompasses a wide variety of materials from
hardened leather tunics to chain shirts forged from steel. It does not
offer complete protection against arrows or swords, but it is better
than having nothing at all. Light armour does not inhibit movement._    
**Save:** A warrior who is wearing light armour has a basic D6
saving throw of 6.



### Sea Dragon Cloak

Dark Elf Corsairs use special cloaks fashioned from Sea Monsters
that dwell deep in the ocean. These cloaks are tough and
resilient and provide Dark Elves with a very good amount of
protection. While no warbands are as capable of acquiring these Cloaks as the Corsairs, their efficacy has not gone unnoticed by other nations - with merchant navies often attempting to acquire these cloaks for sale to wealthy nobles.  
**Protective Cloak:** The Sea Dragon Cloak may be worn in addition to other armour, and grants a 5+ armour save.


### Shield

_There are two types of shield common to the warriors of Mordheim:
the first is made of wood, occasionally reinforced with metal plates.
This basic type of shield, although strong, does tend to splinter, but
this can sometimes save the user’s life as their enemy’s weapon can
get trapped allowing them to strike back whilst their enemy struggles to
free the stuck weapon.
Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and
can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or
triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its
owner._ 
**Save**: A model with a shield has a basic save of 6 on a D6.
**Sword & Board:** A model using a shield and either a Club, Axe, Dagger,
 or Sword can combine the two for even better defence due to their weapon's
ease of use. The Warrior gains an even better save of 5+.

### Wolfcloak

_In Middenland it is still considered to be the feat of a true warrior to
slay a great wolf single-handed. Warriors who accomplish such a
deed will command the respect of their peers, and their cloaks will
be blessed by the High Priest of the Cult of Ulric, the god of winter,
war and wolves._

_[Middenland Mercenaries Only]_ 
To acquire a Wolfcloak, a Hero must pay 10 GC (to represent
the expense of travelling to Middenheim and taking part in a
hunt). In addition, the Hero must roll equal to or under their 
Strength on a D6. If successful, the Hero finds and slays the
wolf and can wear its cloak as a mark of his skill and
prowess. Note that Middenheimers may buy Wolfcloaks
when starting their warband without making a test for
availability. A model wearing a Wolfcloak will gain +2 to their armour saves against all shooting attacks.

## Miscellaneous equipment

This section covers all the strange and unusual equipment your warriors can find in the ruins or buy from the merchants and pedlars in the settlements and villages around Mordheim.    
If an item has the "_One Use Per Battle_" special rule then the item may only be used once per battle and their effects last only for one turn. The Warrior will then freely replenish their stock after the battle, as the cost of purchasing the item is essentially the Warrior acquiring the tools to manufacture their own suppies.

## Alcohol, Drugs, Poisons & Potions

The use of poison is almost universally abhorred, but in the ruthless and brutal battles fought in Mordheim, desperate warbands often resort to the use of envenomed blades. Poison may not be used with blackpowder weapons, and may not be applied to Magical Weapons. They tend to have volatile, often even explosive, reactions to chemical reagents.

### Black Lotus
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_In the deepest forests of the Southlands grows a plant that is
extremely poisonous. It is known as Black Lotus and is much sought
after by alchemists, assassins, wizards of the Western Coast and
bored wives._   
A weapon coated in Black Lotus grants the wielder the Poisoned Attacks special rule.


### Blessed Water
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_The priests of Ulric, Sigmar, Morr and Manann hold great power
against evil. Pure water from a clear fountain, blessed by one of these
priests, is said to burn things of darkness and evil._

_[May not be bought by Undead]_ 
Blessed Water is treated as a Throwing Knife, though rather than using the wielder's strength it automatically wounds on a 2+. Only works against Undead, Daemons, or Possessed.

```
```
### Bugman’s Ale

_Of all the Dwarf brewmasters, Josef Bugman is the most famous.
His ale is known throughout the Old World, and widely regarded as
the best._  
A warband that drinks a barrel of Bugman’s before a battle
will be immune to psychology for the whole of the battle. Elves may
not drink Bugman’s ale as they are far too delicate to cope
with its effects. There is only enough ale to supply the
warband for one battle.

### Crimson Shade
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_Crimson Shade is the name given by Old Worlders to the
leaves of the blood oak of Estalia. It is an extremely addictive
drug, but grants its users inhuman quickness and strength for a brief period._  
**Effect:** A model using Crimson Shade increases their Movement, Strength, Attacks, and Initiative by +1. Crimson Shade has no effect on Undead or Daemons.    
**Side Effects:** After the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-4, the
model becomes addicted and requires ever stronger fixes. The Warrior gains an additional upkeep cost of 15 gold per game, an effect that may stack. If
you fail to fund their increasingly expensive habit, they will leave your warband. On a roll of 12 the model’s Initiative is increased permanently by +1.

### Dark Venom
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
This is a poison extracted from Heldrakes, gigantic sea serpents that
plague the Western Ocean and the coast of Naggaroth. The slightest
wound infected by Dark Venom causes excruciating pain,
incapacitating the bravest of men.  
Any hit caused by a weapon coated with Dark Venom counts
as having +1 Strength, so, for example, if a warrior with
Strength 3 wielding a poisoned sword hits an opponent, he
will cause a Strength 4 hit instead.


#### Garlic


_[May not be bought by Undead]_

_Garlic is a common herb grown in most gardens of the
Empire. It is said to ward off Vampires and other denizens of
the dark._  
A Vampire must pass a Leadership test or it will be
unable to charge a model carrying a clove of garlic. Garlic
lasts for the duration of one battle only, whether it is used or
not.

### Healing Herbs
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_Certain plants that grow on the banks of the River Stir have
curative properties. Herbalists collect their roots and leaves
and use them to treat the sick and wounded._    
A Hero with
healing herbs can use them at the beginning of any of their recovery phases as long as they are not engaged in hand-to-hand
combat. This restores all wounds they have previously lost during the game. 
\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Liquor Flask
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
When drunk the user becomes Immune to Psychology. Doesn't work on any hero who is immune to poison.

### Mandrake Root
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_The man-shaped Mandrake Root grows in the rotting swamps
of Sylvania. It is a noxious, deadly plant which is highly
addictive and slowly kills its users, but also allows them to
shrug off almost any pain._ 
**Effect:** Grants the consumer +1 Toughness. Mandrake Root has no effect on Undead or Daemons. 
**Side Effects:** Mandrake Root is highly poisonous. At the
end of the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-4 the model loses 1
point of Toughness permanently.

### Potion of Strength
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
**Effect:** The Potion adds +D3 to the imbiber's strength.


### Speed Potion
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
_Clear blue flasks of Quicksilver Elixir are unique to Mordheim and have become favourite items of thieves, rogues, assassins, or paranoid nobles for whom a quick getaway is paramount. These potions allow a user to push their body past its normal limits, though at the cost of great exhaustion._ 
**Effect:** The Potion grants +2 Movement, +2 Initiative, but -1 Toughness.


### Tears of Shallaya
_(One Use Per Battle)_

_[Lawful or Lawful/Neutral Humans only.]_   
_Tears of Shallaya are vials of water from the holy spring in
Couronne. Shallaya is the goddess of healing and mercy and
it is said that this water has curative properties and is proof
against any poison._    
A model who drinks a vial of the Tears of Shallaya at the beginning of a battle will be completely immune to all poisons. Undead and Possessed warriors may not use the Tears of Shallaya.

### Vial of Pestilens

_This small crystal vial contains an extremely potent and rapidly acting disease. A single sniff is enough to melt the airways and leave the
victim drowning in its own blood. It is, however, short lived and
only remains dangerous for a few seconds before it is neutralised in
the air._   
_[Skaven only]_ 
The vial may be opened and shoved in the face of the model
in base contact that just took the Skaven Out of Action. The
opponent must roll equal to or under its Toughness or
automatically be taken Out of Action. No save is allowed. If
the opponent succumbs to the disease, he didn’t manage to go
through with the attack and the Skaven is only Stunned not
Out of Action. The vial may be used once, then it is removed from your
equipment.

```
```


#### Vodka
_(One Use Per Battle)_


_Kislevites live in a harsh land under constant threat of
invasion. While this has instilled a seriousness in these
people, it has not diluted their love of celebration one bit. If
anything their love of revelry has increased with the
hardships they have had to endure, as they have learned that
life is fleeting, and any excuse to enjoy what they have been
given is not to be squandered. One of the products of this
love of life and celebration is a strong alcoholic spirit called
vodka. It is also one of the country’s most famous exports,
though most inhabitants of the Old World find it too harsh for
their palates. Kislevites take great enjoyment from this drink and regard it as something almost magical. Mothers give vodka to
their families to ward off sickness and to keep them warm in
the long winter months and warriors indulge both for luck
and courage. Outsiders often scoff at the reputed properties of
this liquor, but it must be said that a Kislevite army that is
well supplied with vodka certainly fights better and in higher
spirits than one without._  
A Hero may give 
Vodka to their warband before the start of the game. Every warrior in the
warband receives +1 Leadership (up to a maximum of 10) for
that game. In addition because of its nullifying alcoholic
effects every warband member must test against their
Toughness before the start of the game – a failure resulting in
-1 Initiative for the duration of the game. Any amount of vodka may
be used in this way for stacking effects. A Warrior who reaches 0 Initiative gains Stupidity.


## Banners

### Banner

Many more established warbands carry a banner or flag, not only to
announce their presence but to also act as a rallying point for the
warband during a battle.
A banner requires one hand to use and can be carried by any
Hero in the warband. Friendly warriors within 12" of the
banner bearer may re-roll failed Leadership Tests. 


## Charms & Amulets

### Lucky Charm
(One per Warband)
These take many shapes, but the most common are symbolic
hammers that a pious Sigmarite Priest has touched, or carved
heads of ancient Dwarf gods. The first time a model with a
lucky charm is hit in a battle they roll a D6. On a 4+ the hit is
discarded and no damage is suffered. 

### Rabbit's Foot
(One per Warband)
The rabbit's foot is a symbol of good luck and often worn
about the neck on a thin cord of leather by superstitious
warriors. A rabbit's foot allows the warrior wearing it to re-roll one dice during the battle. If not used in the battle, it can
be used to re-roll one dice during the Exploration phase,
providing the hero is able to search through the ruins. 

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Tarot Cards


_[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]_ 
Though declared blasphemous and illegal by the Grand
Theogonist, the Tarot of Stars is said to foretell the future for
those who dare to consult it. This future almost always fortells the death of the reader oddly enough.      
A Hero with a deck of tarot cards may consult them before
each game. Take a Leadership test. If successful, the Hero may ignore the first Out of Action injury rolled against them (instead being Knocked Down). If multiple Out of Action rolls happen at once the Cards are useless, and no amount or prophecising will help a Warrior plan around that sort of damage.

If failed the Warrior is so spooked by the prophecy of their own demise that they will not attend the battle.


### Warpstone Amulet


_[Skaven Heroes Only]_

The owner of a warpstone amulet may reroll a single die
during the battle or, if not out of combat at the end of the
game, a single die when looking for wyrdstone shards.

### Wyrdstone Pendulum


_[Skaven Heroes Only]_

Pendulums made of wyrdstone can reputedly be used to magnetise Wyrdstone, sucking nearby shards in and clamping them against the Pendulum. This makes them excellent for getting at shards in those 'hard to reach' places, such as the pockets of a rival.

A hero with a Wyrdstone Pendulum may pick up any Wyrdstone within 2" as if they had moved into contact with it, even if it is currently being held by another model (including allies).

## Magic, Books & Scrolls

### Dispel Scroll
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
This scroll contains a powerful counter-spell. It may be read
aloud immediately after an opponent has successfully cast a
spell (but before results have been determined) to negate its
effects. When used roll a D6. The enemy spell is cancelled on
a roll of 4 or more.


### Halfling Cookbook
(Halflings Only)    
All Halfling chefs have their own secret recipes, and these are
recorded in tomes handwritten in Mootland, the home country of the
Halflings. So famous are some of these books that adventurous Halflings will venture even into places as dangerous as Mordheim to sample these recipes. A warband with a Halfling Cookbook pays 1 gold less when hiring new Halflings, and may own any number of Halfling Cookbooks (though the cost of new Halflings may never go negative. Even Halflings aren't crazy enough to pay people to get them killed)

```
```
### Holy (Unholy) Relic

_In this age of superstition and religious fanaticism, holy objects are
an important part of life. Relics abound in the Old World: hairs of
Sigmar, pieces from Ulric’s hammer, teeth of Daemon Princes, all
are sold to men needing encouragement before battle and as charms
against sorcery._


A model with a holy relic will automatically pass the first
Leadership test he is required to make in the game. If worn
by the leader, it will allow him to automatically pass the first
Rout test if he has not taken any Leadership tests before.
You can only ignore the first Leadership test in any single
game – owning two or more holy relics will not allow you to
ignore second and subsequent tests.

### Holy Tome

_A Holy Tome is a reknowned text dedicated to any one of the incredible variety of gods in The Old World. The most common in Mordheim are Holy Tomes of Sigmar, but those devoted to other (often less wholesome) deities are also never far from view.._   
A Prayer User with a Holy Tome may grant +2 to their casting attempts.



### Magic Gugginz


_[Greenskins Only]_

These are odds and ends carried around by the Shaman to
focus his powers. Most are bat feet, lizard lips, and the like,
but still seem to provide benefits to their owner.  
The Shaman
may re-roll a failed magic test on a D6 roll of 4+.

### Mordheim Map

_Some survivors of the cataclysm still remain in the many settlements
around Mordheim, and make a living by preparing maps of the city
from memory. Many of these maps are faked, and even real ones are
often crude and inaccurate.
A map can help a warband find their way through the
confusing maze of streets and into areas with rich buildings
to loot._   
When you buy a map, roll a D6:  
**1 Fake:** The map is a fake, and is completely worthless.
It leads you on a fool’s errand. Your opponent may
automatically choose the next scenario you play.    
**2-3 Vague:** Though crude, the map is generally accurate
(well... parts of it are... perhaps!). You may re-roll
any one dice during the next exploration phase if you
wish but you must accept the result of the second roll  
**4 Catacomb Map:** The map shows a way through the
catacombs into the city. You may automatically
choose the scenario next time you fight a battle.   
**5 Accurate:** The map is recently made and very
detailed. You may re-roll up to three dice during the
next exploration phase if you wish. You must accept
the result of the second roll.  
**6 Master Map:** This is one of the twelve master maps
of Mordheim made for Count von Steinhardt of
Ostermark. From now on you may always re-roll one
dice when rolling on the Exploration chart as long as
the Hero who possesses this map is not taken out of
action in the battle.

### Scroll of the Rat Familiar


_[Skaven Only]_

The Scroll of the Rat Familiar has a spell inscribed on it,
usable by a Pestilens Sorcerer as many times as he wants. If
the warband includes at least one Giant Rat, the spell may be
cast on it before the combat begins, transforming it in a Rat
Familiar. If his Rat Familiar is within 6'', the sorcerer may
reroll once in a game the dice to overcome the difficulty of a
spell. A sorcerer may only have one Rat Familiar at any one
time; it is a henchman and it counts normally toward the
maximum number of models permitted to the warband. If the
sorcerer dies, his Rat Familiar turns back to Giant Rat form.

### Tome of Magic


_[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]_

Sometimes books of forbidden lore are offered for sale in the
markets and dark alleys of the settlements around Mordheim.
A tome of magic may be consumed by a wizard in order to add +1 to their wizard level,
and in the case of Mordheim wizards unlocks access to one lore of magic
appropriate to their closest Warhammer counterpart. A wizard may consume multiple
tomes but may not increase their wizard level above 4.

## Musical Instruments

A musician must have an instrument to play so he can sing songs, tell tales and make hideous noises. A Musician may not have more than one instrument (they tend not to live long enough to become one-man bands).

### Drum


_[Musician only]_

These are barrels with a tanned hide stretched over them to make
the sound.
The mallet may be used as a club and the drum as a shield.
Grants a further +1 Movement when using the Marching Tune skill.

### Flute


_[Musician only]_

These are made of wood or bone.
Allied Warriors within 6" of a Musician using a Flute (including the Musician themselves) gain +1 Leadership.

### Lyre


_[Musician only]_

These are made of wood with strings strung to play tunes.
When using this with the minstrel skill it adds 1d6 to the gold
earned.

### War Horn

The blaring sound of a war horn can be enough to stir the
hearts of any warband which it is attempting to rouse. It
grants men courage and gives them the will to fight on
defiantly. A war horn may be sounded once per battle at the
beginning of any of the player's turn. Everybody in the owning player's warband increases their Leadership by 1. The effect will last until the
start of the next turn. The war horn can be used just before a
warband is about to take a Rout test.

```
```

## Explosives

### Fire Bomb
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
Designed by the dwarf engineers of the Worlds Edge
Mountains, fire bombs are a rare and deadly weapon. A small
batch of gunpowder is sealed within an iron casting with a
short fuse fed into it. When lit, the thrower has only seconds
before the gunpowder ignites and explodes. This can often
prove to be dangerous, as if the fire bomb is fused incorrectly or otherwise fumbled it could be the thrower who finds themselves amidst the explosion!

To throw a Fire Bomb, nominate a location within line of sight and 8" range. Place the small round template there, then roll the Artillery and Scatter dice. Move the template by the direction shown, and models under it are hit. On a Misfire result, center the template over the thrower. Fire Bombs inflict a single S3 flaming hit.

### Flash Powder
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
An ancient Dwarf creation, flash powder is used in mines to
illuminate darkened fissures in the search for gold and other
precious minerals. In Mordheim, small bags of this substance
can be used to blind enemies, throwing them into disarray as a panicked last resort.

If the holder of Flash Powder is neither _incapacitated_ nor engaged in combat then they may 
throw the Powder at a model that charges them as an interrupt. From where the charger began its charge the model with Powder may attempt to throw it as if they were shooting at the charger with a Thrown Weapon. 

If the charger was out of range or not in sight then the Powder may not be used, as the user simply wasn't expecting to be charged so abruptly! Should the user successfully hit the target the charge will fail, as if they had failed a leadership test to charge a Fear-causing opponent.

### Smoke Bombs
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
When thrown these bags of powder explode with a small bang and
release a cloud of dense smoke that obscures vision, enabling sneaky getaways or dastardly backstabbing.
To throw a smoke bomb, nominate a spot within line of sight and within 6" of the thrower. Throwing the Smoke Bomb counts as the warrior's shooting attack. When a smoke bomb goes off it makes a column of smoke 2"
wide and 4" high that blocks line of sight, but may be moved through freely. At the start of each of your turns roll a D6:  
**1-4:** The smoke clears, remove it from the table.    
**5:** The smoke moves D6" in a random direction. It will fall if this movement takes it off of a ledge etcetera, but it will not climb It never takes damage.  
**6:** The smoke stays put.



## Other Items

### Caltrops
_(One Use Per Battle)_  
A Warrior that uses Caltrops will for that turn cause any enemy that attempts to charge it to take a Dangerous Terrain test.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Lantern

A model that is in possession of a lantern may add +4" to the
distance from which they are able to spot hidden enemies, and gains +1 Initiative when attempting to do so.

### Lock Picks

A standard piece of kit for less scrupulous characters. A Warrior equipped with Lock Picks will never have to test to see if chests or crates are trapped. 


### Opulent Coach

Truly successful warband leaders are quite willing to waste their
money on extravagant excesses such as rare wines, jewel-encrusted
weapons and armour and Cathayan spices. The height of such
indulgence is an opulent coach, which the warband leader can use
for driving around the settlements surrounding Mordheim. There
are few things that will impress commoners, or incur the wrath and
envy of other, less successful leaders, as much as an opulent coach - though quite what 'opulence' means will vary wildly from Warband to Warband. To a Goblin it may simply mean it is festooned with an extraordinarily large amount of random junk.


The opulent coach impresses even the most suspicious
merchant and they will flock to offer their most exotic wares
to the obviously rich warband leader. The warband leader
gains +3 to any rolls to locate rare items, and their Leadership range for the Leader ability becomes mapwide.

A coach also functions as a Chariot with a potential crew size of 1, and is drawn by one mount, chosen freely by whatever makes sense for your warband. You may not choose _Large_ draft animals to pull the coach. It has a Strength of 4, a Toughness of 5, and an Armour Save of 4+.

### Rope & Hook

A warrior using a rope & hook will find it much easier to move
amongst the ruins of Mordheim.
A warrior equipped with a rope & hook may re-roll failed
Initiative tests when climbing up and down.

### Telescope

Common to the great astronomers in the observatories at
Nuln, telescopes are a useful, if highly rare, item to have in
the City of the Damned. The keen view offered by these
instruments makes shooting easier and gives an unparalleled awareness of a warrior's surroundings. 

A Hero with a Telescope has no maximum range on their ranged weapons, though the distance for the purposes of "Long Range" penalties remains unchanged. Shooting beyond their weapon's conventional maximum range will confer an additional -1 to hit. Does not work on thrown weapons or weapons that do not roll a conventional 'to hit' dice (such as Blunderbusses, Mortars, Warpfire Throwers etcetera). However, the Hero's Initiative is doubled for the purposes of attempting to spot hidden enemies.

```
```

### Torch

Torches are long and durable rods the ends of which are soaked in a dense tar of highly flammable material - be it a Wyrdstone-caked rag, a pitch-soaked strap, or dense and dripping Troll-wax. They are dangerous and cumbersome to use, but their ability to ward off foes and to detect hidden dangers makes them a global staple of any sentry or explorer.

At the start of a battle Warriors with Torches must decide whether or not to use them. Once lit a torch is not easily unlit, and is even more difficult to calmly put away - a Warrior with a lit torch may not fire ranged weapons and may only use a single-handed weapon or shield in their other hand for the rest of the game. 
**Scary:** A model with a lit Torch causes Fear in all War Beasts and Cavalry.  
**Still a Club:** A Torch may be used as a Club in combat, and has the Flaming Attacks special rule - though will strike at -1 Strength.    
**Extremely Common:** Any Henchmen  capable of equipping items may use a Torch. 
**Sore Thumb:** No model may hide within 4" of a model with a Torch, including the bearer.


## Attack Animals

The most common attack animal in the Old World is the
faithful war hound, especially favoured by Witch Hunters.
Other warbands have their favoured attack animals – Giant
Rats for Skaven, Dire Wolves for Vampires, Cold One Beast-
hounds for the Druchii. Whatever the differences between the
species, that a warrior with several sets of claws and jaws
behind him is a more dangerous opponent than a warrior on
his own.

Attack Animals may only be purchased by Heroes that have taken the "Beast Companion" skill. They otherwise behave exactly like Henchmen within your warband, having their own group and contributing to Rout Tests as normal. All animals listed below are, unsurprisingly, animals - and therefore do not gain experience, and may not pick up treasure.

### Bear
_Bears are large animals often found in the forests of the Old World.
Normally they are peaceful creatures but when they feel threatened
they rip into their opponents with sharp deadly claws. Their strong
arms can wrap around a Warrior and slowly squeeze the life out of
him._

**Weapons/Armour:** RAWWRRRR. Bears do not use weapons or armour, and suffer no penalty for doing so.

##### Special Rules 
**Fear:** As a large, slavering, roaring beast bears cause _fear_.  
**Large:** Bears are _Large_ sized. 


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Birds of Prey

_Falcons and other birds of prey are much saught after by beast masters
as they are very useful for catching game and hindering opponents
by attacking weak spots such as the face and groin of enemy warriors._

##### Special rules

**As The Crow Fies:** Birds of Prey are small and nimble masters of the skies, able to even dart through small windows with effortless grace. They therefore ignore all terrain.        
**Evasion:** Birds of Prey have a 4+ Ward Save against hand-to-hand attacks and missiles.






### Cave Squig
_Many Greenskins come to adore Squigs for all sorts of reasons - Orcs find them adorable little murder machines, and Goblins meanwhile simply cannot trust anyone else to reliably defend them. As a result the biggest, meanest squigs make for excellent companions!_

_[Greenskins Only]_


| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Cave Squig |4| 4| 0 |5| 3| 1| 4| 3| 5|

##### Special Rules
**GERROFF ME! WAAAAAAHHHH!:** If a Cave Squig's owner is ever _incapacitated_ within a Cave Squig's charge range it will, as long as it is unengaged and not _incapacitated_, immediately charge its owner. Combat will continue until either the owner is taken Out of Action or the Squig is _incapacitated_.




### Chaos Hound
(Chaotic warbands only) 
_Some Warriors of Chaos control packs of snarling, vicious war
dogs. These creatures have been cruelly mutated by their exposure
to Chaos, and bear barbed tails, skeletal faces and sometimes extra
heads and limbs._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |

```

 
### Cold One Beast-hound
(Dark Elves only)   
_The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beast-hound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beast-hounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beast-hound is indeed very aggressive. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world._

|Beast-hound| 6| 3| 0 |4| 4 |1| 1| 2| 4|

##### Special rules

**Stupidity:** Cold One Beast-Hounds have the _Stupidity_ special rule. 
**Scaly Skin:** Cold One Beast-Hounds have a 5+ Armour Save.    
**Fear:**  Cold One Beast-Hounds cause _fear_.

### Familiar
_Wizards and Priests are often solitary, usually shunned by those who can barely
conceive of, much less understand, the power these individuals
wield. As such, they often share their lives with animal companions,
rather than more ‘sentient’ beings. Sometimes a magical link will
develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent
that the wizard begins to see through the animal’s eyes, and hear its
thoughts._

|Familiar| 6 |4 | 0|4| 3| 1| 4| 1| 5|
___
**Options:** The Familiar can be upgraded to one of the
following; Combat Familiar (+35 GC), Power Familiar (+45
GC) or Spell Familiar (+85 GC).

##### Special rules
**Ritual Summoning:** Unlike most companions, the cost of buying a Familiar is the cost of attempting a ritual to conjure up the creature. Even if you fail your Rarity Roll when attempting to find a familiar, you still have to pay the total cost of the Familiar. Familiars may not subsequently be upgraded or changed to different forms after purchase.

### Hunting Cats
_Hunting Cats are large ferocious predators capable of tearing a man to
pieces, though they are best known for their rarity and beauty. Ownership of a Hunting Cat is often the sign of a truly affluent (or pompous) warrior._

### Snotling
(Greenskins Only)   
_Snotlings are the smallest of the green-skinned races. They are not
very intelligent and behave very much like extremely enthusiastic
and uncontrollable puppies. They can fetch and carry for other
Goblin or Orc races, and do other rather limited tasks, but they are
little use for any real work._

**Extremely cowardly:** The Snotling may never end its turn more than 6" from its master or it will immediately flee, and is treated as _Out of Action_.

### War Hound

_[Not available to Skaven]_

_The men of the Empire have always been experts at raising
ferocious bloodhounds to guard their cattle and holdings against
roaming Goblins and Beastmen. A highly trained War hound is a
dangerous opponent and worth its weight in gold in Mordheim._

### Wild Hog
_Wild Hogs are useful beasts in the streets of Mordheim as they
trample down the street squealing and knocking people out of their
way. They also have a terrible odour that often make them an
unfavourable animal to have around the camp._

### Wolf
_Wolves prowl the lands of the Old World, hunting other weaker
animals for prey. Occasionally, they will become very bloodthirsty
and attack adventurers instead, especially if they are hungry and
are travelling in a large group._

## Ridden Animals

Ridden animals may be bought for any _Small_ Hero who has the Ride skill. They are treated as Equipment, though may attack in combat unless stated otherwise with their own profile. Unless otherwise stated, mounts will always increase the size of the rider to _Medium_.

### Chaos Steed
Whereas humans possessed by Daemons become hulking monstrosities utterly lacking in human emotion and wholly hellbent on a desire to kill, horses... Actually behave the same way. Cultists conduct blasphemous rituals to corrupt these otherwise innocent animals, causing them to become wild and aggressive. Chaos Steeds are vast barnhorse-like creatures with jet black hair and razor-sharp fangs, and their whinney is like the screaming of a dozen stuck swine.

### Cold One
_Scaly, mean and stupid, these native creatures of the New
World make excellent mounts upon which to fight._

##### Special rules

**Fear:** Primordial cold blooded predators cause _fear_.   
**Unruly:** If the rider of a Cold One attempts any voluntary movement other than charging they must roll a D6. On a 1 they may not move, instead wrestling for control.    
**Thick Scales:** Cold Ones grant the rider an additional +1 to their armour save beyond the usual +1 for being mounted.




### Elven Steed
_Elven steeds are graceful animals, but have a vicious
temperament when called upon to fight. It is rumoured that
even Dark Elves breed these fine beasts. Typically, High Elf
steeds are grey and white, Wood Elf steeds are tan and white,
and Dark Elf steeds are midnight black._

### Giant Wolf
_The giant wolf is common in most of the mountain ranges of
the known world. However, catching one of these nasty, fast
moving beasts is another thing – especially if you are a
Goblin._

burden are occasionally ridden by Halflings, Dwarfs and

### Nightmare
_Living up to their name, Nightmares are shadowy apparitions in the guise of horses. They are creatures of pure magic, their hoofsteps leaving wisps of deathly fog in their wake._

### Horse (riding)

around the site of a battle._

### Skeletal Steed

horses, but when they died their flesh decomposed. When all that
was left of them was their bones, evil Necromancers raised them
from the dead._

### War Boar
_Large, ferocious and bad-tempered – a perfect mount for an Orc
Warlord. Orc warbands occasionally make use of these noisome
beasts while exploring the ruins of Mordheim and beyond. It isn’t
common though, as the bigger and meaner Orcs tend to take the
boars for themselves._

_[Orcs Only]_

| War Boar | 7 | 3 | 0 | 3 | - | - | 3 | 1 | 3 |


##### Special rules

**Ferocious Charge:** Orc war boars attack with +2S when
charging, due to their bulk. Note that this applies only to the
boar, not the rider.    
**Thick Skinned:** The thick skin and matted fur of the boar
makes him very hard to wound. Boars confer an additional
+1 bonus to the rider’s armour save (making +2 total).

### Warhorse
_Warhorses are large, well-trained horses, quite at home in
battle. They are primarily used by human warbands._
