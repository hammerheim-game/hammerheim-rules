### Skills & Abilities Lists

The Skill lists are used to pick skills earned as advances. Your warrior is restricted to specific Skill lists depending upon his
warband type and what kind of warrior he is. Each warband entry includes a list of skills available to the Heroes of that
particular warband.
All warbands have their own strengths and weaknesses which relate to the skills available to them. For example, the Possessed
are good fighters and very strong, but they are not very academically minded.
Some warbands also have access to a unique Skill list, which is clearly indicated in their entry.

#### Common Skills

The common skills are available to any Hero, Henchmen & Hired Sword who wishers for these Skills.
Animal\Beast Handler (e.g. War hound): This skill is highly
beneficial if non-ridden animals are to be included in a warband.
This skill must be taken for specific animals and may be taken
multiple times for different animals. It represents knowledge of the
general care and well being of the animal as well as training
techniques.

A warrior with this skill has a beneficial effect on the animals under
his care. If a warrior has the Animal Handling skill for a particular
animal, any such animals may use his Leadership provided he is
within 6". If the Warband’s leader is also nearby, a player may
choose which of the warriors’ Leadership to use unless the animal is
stupid, in which case only the handler’s Leadership may be used. In
addition, stubborn animals with a handler in base contact ignore the
effects of stubbornness.

Beast Companion: A Hero or Warrior with this skill may buy an
attack animal, the attack animal must be set up with the owning
model within 3". But free to move around once started. The attack
animal may use the owner Leadership if within 6". The attack
animal does not count towards the maximum number of warriors
allowed in your warband. If the owner is stunned or knocked down,
the attack animal will move to it owner and guard him\her until the
Owner get up or the games ends. If the owner dies the attack animal
is lost.


Mark of Chaos: Few who travel to Mordheim do so with good intentions,
indeed many see the calamitous destruction of Sigmar's followers as a 
sign that the site is clearly of great interest to the Chaos Gods.
Eager to prove themselves to their new masters they may
dedicate themselves to their worship.

Heroes from a Neutral / Chaotic or Chaotic warbands (other than
Skaven and undead) may immediately choose one Mark of Chaos. Due to the
brashness, arrogance, boastfulness, and self-importance instilled 
universally upon any Chaos worshipper who recieves a visible gift of their
patron god each Mark taken in this way will add an upkeep cost of 5 gold
per game. If the leader has any other mark then Undivided all models must 
have the same mark.

Medical Knowledge: If you have a warrior in your warband with
this skill you may re-roll a result on the Serious Injury table. If the
model with this skill is not taken out of action.

Musician: Musicians are important to a warband both during and
after a battle. They can sing and tell tales to raise extra income, sing
songs of valour during battle to embolden the troops, and rally the
troops when things look bad.
Warrior with this skill can choose skills from the Musicians Skills
list. Only one model per warband may have this skill, and Musicians 
recruited from the Warhammer books automatically have it.

Mob Mentality: If a model with this skill is within 3”
of at least three other models from his warband, then he gives all of
the models in that area, including himself, immunity to fear and +1
Initiative. If the model, with Mob Mentality, is taken out of action
while giving bonuses, then all models who are benefiting from the
effects will automatically fail an “All alone check” and move
accordingly.

Money Maker: The model with this skill utilizes his
talents and wares to try and make extra money after the adventure. If
the model is not taken out of action, they may roll an additional die
during the exploration phase. There may not be more than one character
with the Money Maker skill in your warband. There's just not enough money!

Ride: This skill is vital if a rider wishes to ride an
animal into combat. Taking this skill once will allow a Warrior to ride any
War Beast class mount. Taking this skill twice will allow a Warrior to ride any
Monstrous Mount. Taking this skill a third time will allow a Warrior to
ride Monsters. The mount options available to each Warrior must be appropriate
to their race however, so an Orc could not ride a Wolf (as Wolves are for Goblins!)
Warriors with this skill can choose skills from the Cavalry Skills list

Sneaky: All enemy models halve their Initiative range when trying
to detect this model while he is Hidden.

Drive Chariot: Taking this skill will allow a Hero ride a Chariot.

#### Combat Skills

Strike to Injure: The warrior can land his blows with uncanny
accuracy. Add +1 to all injury rolls caused by the model in hand-to-
hand combat.

Combat Master: The warrior is able to take on several opponents at
once. If he fights against more than one enemy at a time, he gains an
extra Attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase as long as he is
fighting two or more enemy models. In addition, the warrior is
immune to ‘All Alone’ tests.

Weapons Training: A warrior with this skill is adept at using many
different weapons. He may use any hand-to-hand combat weapon he
comes across, not just those in his equipment options.

Flashy Fighting: Few can match the ability of this warrior. He fights
with great skill and flair, weaving a web of steel around him. The model
gains +2 to all his rolls on Critical Hit tables in hand-to-hand
combat.

Expert Swordsman: This warrior has been expertly taught in the
art of swordsmanship. He may re-roll all missed attacks if he is
using a sword in the hand-to-hand phase of the turn that he charges.
Note that this only applies when they are armed with normal swords
or weeping blades, and not with double-handed swords or any other
weapons.

Step Aside: The warrior has a natural ability to avoid injury in
combat. The warrior gains a 5+ Ward Save against wounds inflicted by
hand-to-hand combat.

Axe Master: The warrior may parry with normal axes as per normal
parrying rules.

Disarm: The warrior may opt to forego his normal attacks and
attempt to disarm a single opponent. To disarm the opponent, the
warrior must declare what weapon he is disarming and then roll to
hit the foe at a -2 WS for a single handed weapon and a -3 WS for a
2 handed weapon. If successful the opponent must fight without the
designated weapon until he recovers it. The foe recovers his weapon
in the first Recovery Phase out of Hand-to-Hand. Not vs. natural
weaponry such as teeth/claws etc.

Expert Axeman: A Warrior with this skill may re-roll any failed to-hit
rolls with single-handed axes in the combat phase of the turn he charges.

Finishing Move: The warrior may opt to forgo his usual number of
attacks and make a single attack at an additional +2 Strength to its
normal strength. This can be used in conjunction with Mighty Blow,
Weapon Bonuses, and any other Strength enhancing abilities. The
blow is resolved last AFTER 2 Handed Weapons. Useful for taking
out Knocked Down models with high Toughness.

Follow-Through: If a Warrior manages to take all of their opponents
Out of Action in the same combat phase in which they charged they may
immediately make an additional 2" movement. This move may bring them 
into base contact with another model in which case they are considering
as having charged them too and will immediately fight in that turn's
combat. A Warrior may not Follow-Through more than once per turn, and
will be at -1 Strength for that combat phase (including for the purposes
of Impact Hits, also applying to their mount if they have one). 

Pugilist: The warrior may treat their bare fists as clubs. They will
never count as being Unarmed, and will count as being equipped with
clubs equal to their number of arms. Yes, you can be a mutant Pugilist
who boxes with their extra tentacles and crab hand.

Shield Smash: The warrior has trained to integrate his shield into
his fighting style. When using a Shield or Buckler in Hand-to-Hand
he may make a single additional attack resolved at the warriors
Strength. The Shield Smash cannot cause critical hits. 

Sweeping Blow: The warrior may opt to make a single sweep attack
against all the models in base to base contact with him instead of
making his normal attacks. Rather than rolling to hit, each foe must
take an Initiative test to avoid the blow. Each model failing their
test is hit, and the warrior rolls to wound each enemy
independently as normal. This maneuver can only be executed with
a two-handed weapon (including halberds and flails, etc.), but no
Strength bonuses granted by the weapons themselves are included.

Whip Master: The hero has mastered the brown hat, and may re-roll
all failed to-hit rolls with Whipcrack. Additionally enemies must 
re-roll any successful armour saves made from the Whipcrack attack.
Note that this does not benefit the hero's regular attacks.

#### Shooting Skills

Quick Shot: The warrior may shoot twice per turn with a bow or
crossbow (but not a crossbow pistol).

Pistolier: The warrior is an expert at using all kinds of pistols. If he
is equipped with a brace of pistols of any type (including crossbow
pistols), he may fire twice in the Shooting phase (though note that
normal reloading rules apply). If he has a single pistol then he may
fire it in the same turn it was reloaded.

Eagle Eyes: The warrior’s sight is exceptionally keen. He adds +6"
to the range of any missile weapon he is using.

cannot be combined with the Quick Shot skill. This does not apply to
War Machines.

Trick Shooter: The warrior can shoot through the tiniest gap
without it affecting his aim. He ignores all modifiers for cover when
using missile weapons.

Action Hero: Ammunition somehow doesn't appear to be a problem for this
hero! The Warrior never needs to reload their weapons.

Knife-Fighter: The warrior is an unrivalled expert at using lightweight
throwing weapons. They can throw a maximum of three of these missiles in 
their shooting phase and may divide their shots between any targets 
within range as they wish. This only works with generic throwing weapons,
not Throwing Axes or Javellins for example.

Vitals Shot: The warrior is adept at shooting where it hurts the
most. He adds +1 to rolls on the Critical Wound effect chart when
using ranged attacks.

Fletcher: The warrior makes his own arrows. When shooting a bow,
his arrows are +1 to rolls on the Injury Chart.
Heavy Pull: The warrior has trained to use a bow with a heavier
draw. All attacks made by the warrior with a bow are at +1 Strength.

The mental powers of the wizard allow him to wear armor
and cast spells.

Scribe: The warrior is a natural adept at writing and making scrolls.
Any warrior with the ability to cast spells or use prayers may take
this skill. It allows them to make a scroll before the battle and
inscribe a single spell or prayer upon it that they are versed in. The
scroll may be used just before they are about to cast the spell or
prayer and allows the caster +2 to his difficulty roll. Once used the
scroll will crumble to dust and is useless. Scrolls may not be saved
up from battle to battle if they are not used.

Mind Focus: The warrior possesses a great strength of mind which
allows him to concentrate beyond the levels of most normal men.
This skill may only be taken by a be taken by Magic / Pray Users.
When using a spell or prayer the warrior with this skill may reroll
one dice roll used in the difficulty roll.

Tactician: This skill may only be taken by a warband leader. The

positions for his warriors to meet the oncoming attack. In any scenario
the player may deploy their Warband 4" further onto the board than usual.

Hunch: This skill may only be taken by the warband leader. The
warrior has an uncanny knack of placing their men in the right place
at the right time, as if they sense danger through instinct alone. The warband

in any building on the board that is atleast 12 inch away from an enemy 
model and not in the enemy deployment zone.

Magical Aptitude: This skill may only be taken by a Magic User. It
may not be used by pray-users. The warrior has a keep aptitude for
magic and can push themself beyond normal limits to produce a
storm of spells, allowing them to cast twice per turn. After attempting the
first spell, they must take a toughness test. If they pass they may attempt
a second spell that turn or even cast the same spell twice. If they fail
they must roll on the injury table immediately with no saves treating
Out Of Action results as Stunned instead.

#### Strength Skills

Mighty Blow: The warrior knows how to use his strength to
maximum effect and has a +1 Strength bonus in close combat. 

Pit Fighter: The warrior has learned how to fight in enclosed spaces
from their time in the dangerous fighting pits of the Empire. They are an
expert at fighting in confined areas and adds +1WS and +1A if they
are fighting inside buildings or ruins. It’s a good idea
to define which bits of your terrain collection count as ‘buildings or
ruins’ at the start of a battle to avoid confusion later.

Resilient: The warrior is covered in battle scars. They gain +1 Toughness
against attacks made in close combat.

Fearsome: Such is the reputation and physique of the model that he
causes fear in opposing models.

Strongman: The warrior is capable of great feats of strength. He

other weapons.

foe Stunned on a 2-5 on Injury Chart.

Untiring: When wielding Flails and Morning Stars, the Hero may

not just the first round of a Hand-to-Hand engagement. (Created by
Jester.)

Strong Legs: The Hero may use Heavy Armor and a Shield
without suffering Movement penalties.

Beastmaster: If the model confronts an animal (not mount!) in hand-to- 
hand combat, then before combat is fought they may take a Ld test. If the
test is successful then the animal falls under their command. The animal then
come under control of the Beastmaster's warband. Control of the animal is immediately
lost if the Beastmaster either moves more than 8" away ir is _incapacitated_.

#### Speed Skills (may not be used while riding).

Leap: The warrior may leap D6" in the movement phase in addition
to his normal movement. He may move and leap, run and leap, or
charge and leap, but he can only leap once per turn.
A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models,
including enemies, and obstacles 1" high, without penalty.
The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you
must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice
to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he
falls through the gap (see page 6).

Sprint: The warrior may triple his Movement rate when he runs or
charges, rather than doubling it as normal.
Acrobat: The warrior is incredibly supple and agile. He may fall or
jump from a height of up to 12" without taking any damage if he
passes a single Initiative test, and can re-roll failed Diving Charge
rolls. 

Lightning Reflexes: The Warrior negates the 'strikes first' bonus of
any model that charges them.

Get Down Mister President!: Sometimes you've got to put your own life on
the line to protect your leaders. Exactly how one would perform an Intercept
to block a charging foe, a Warrior with this skill may perform an Intercept
to move into the path of a missile or Magic Missile that would hit an ally.
The Warrior must pass a Leadership test in order to perform this manouvre, but 
if successful they will move into the path of the projectile and take the hit
instead of the intended target. Damage is then resolved normally.

Jump Up: The warrior can regain his footing in an instant,
springing to his feet immediately if he is Knocked Down. The
warrior may ignore Knocked Down results when rolling for injuries,
unless he is Knocked Down because of a successful save from
wearing a helmet or because he has the No Pain special rule.

Dodge: A warrior with this skill is nimble and as fast as quicksilver.
They gain a 5+ Ward Save against all missiles and Magic Missiles.

Scale Sheer Surfaces: A warrior with this skill can scale even the
highest wall or fence with ease. They no longer require Initiative tests
for climbing. (Jumping down still requires them).

Roll Dodge: The warrior can ignore the 2" Interception rule when
charging in to Hand-to-Hand combat.

Fleet Footed: The warrior gains +1 to his base Movement.



#### Assassin Special Skills

Backstabber: The assassin specializes in attacking his targets when
their back is turned. If The Assassin charges a foe from outside of line
of sight (therefore needing an Initiative Test to do so) they surprise their opponent
and receive a +1 to hit with all attacks and any Injury Rolls are at +1.
This bonus lasts for the first round of combat only, as their opponent will 
swiftly recover their wits if they survive the initial assault.

Silent Takedown: If an Assassin manages to _incapacitate_ a target within the same
round of combat as they charged it they may make an immediate free movement of up to
2". Assuming this movement would put them into a position to do so, they may then
go into hiding. This move may not take them into combat with a new enemy.

Opportunistic Killer: An assassin's preferred foe is an oblivious one. If an
assassin completes a diving charge against an unengaged foe they gain the 
_Killing Blow_ special rule for that round of combat.

Master of Poisons: The assassin is a master in brewing up different
poisons. If the hero does not search for rare items, they may
brew up D3-1 portions of either dark venom or black lotus. It may come up
empty, but those are the hazards of trying these intricate things
on the move. The portions are large enough for one weapon and
need to be used for the next battle as they are less stable then
normally purchased poisons.

Master of Disguise: Paranoia is rewarded in Mordheim, and warriors quickly
learn to watch the shadows and remember to look up. In the chaos of a skirmish
innovative thinking can even turn a direct assault into a surprise! Before the 
start of a game the Assassin's owner may choose to have the Assassin replace a
henchman in either their own or a Formal Ally's warbands. Secretly make a note
of which henchman has been replaced. The disguised assassin gains the equipment 
and stats of that henchman until they are revealed. An assassin is automatically 
revealed if they are charged, or they be revealed at the start of their owning
player's turn. Once an assassin is revealed they immediately recover their own gear 
and behave as normal. Assassins may not disguise themselves as Monstrous Infantry,
no amount of low-brimmed hats and hunching will make an Elf look like a convincing Ogre.

Hitman: The Assassin is a master of acting natural and hiding in plain 
sight, allowing them to go into Hiding even if in the open and in line of sight of
an enemy. This ability ceases to work for the rest of the battle if the
assassin attacks an enemy or attempts to pick up loot.

Infiltration: The Assassin with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.

#### Beastmen Raiders Special Skills

Shaggy Hide: The Beastman’s massively shaggy hide acts as
armor, deflecting sword strokes and protecting him from harm. The
model gains a 6+ Armor Save that can be combined with other
armor as normal.

Mutant: The Beastman gains a Random Mutation.

Fearless: Immune to Fear and All Alone tests.

Giant Horns: The Beastman gains Impact Hits (1)

Bellowing Roar: Only the Beastman Chief may have this skill. He
may re-roll any failed Rout tests.

Hateful Bloody Goat: Gains Hatred (Everyone, including allies).

Oppression: Beastmen henchmen within 8" of a Hero with this skill
will not have to test for Infighting.

Violent: The Hero now suffers from Infighting!

#### Blessings of Nurgle

from terrible diseases and decay, which are known as Blessings of
Nurgle.
Blessings of Nurgle may be bought for Tainted Ones only when
they are recruited; you may not buy new Blessings for a model after
recruitment. Any Tainted may have one or more Blessings. The first
Blessing is bought at the price indicated, but second and subsequent
Blessings cost double.

grotesque stream of maggots, entrails and filth. This attack uses the

modifier on all attacks.

diseased, flabby folds. It gains +1 Wound and +1 Toughness but has
its Movement reduced by -1.

Nurgle, the three spheres, that weep foul pus constantly. It gains +1

for his enemies. He gains one additional Attack to his profile.

rolls a natural 6 on the to-hit roll, he automatically wounds his
opponent. No parries are allowed, although the opponent may make
armor or saving throws.

the peasants and chaff. Only heroes are worth his time! The vampire 
re-rolls failed 'to hit' rolls against heroes.

enemies armed with shooting weapons.
Virtue of the Impetuous: The Knight gains an additional +D3" to
his move when charging. Roll the dice each time you wish to charge
and before moving the model.

#### Cavalry Skills


Cavalry Commander. Mounted heroes are an impressive sight.
With a good vantage point, they can see (and be seen) far more
readily than if they were on foot. If the warband's leader has this
skill and is mounted, he may add an extra 6" to the distance within
which other warriors in the warband may use his Leadership. This is
in addition to any other bonuses that increase the range of the
leader’s influence.
Trick Riding. By athletically hanging off the side of his mount, a
rider makes himself harder to hit. While a rider is trick riding all
missile attacks against him suffer -1 to hit in addition to other
modifiers. The rider must declare that he is trick riding before
moving. He must then make an initiative test and if successful may
move full distance. If he fails he loses control of his mount and must
roll immediately on the Whoa Boy! Table. 
Combat Riding. The rider has trained his mount to use its bulk to
trample any unmounted enemy before him. The mount of a warrior with
this skill gains Impact Hits (1) against Infantry, Swarms, and War Beasts.
Evade. The rider has trained his mount to swerve from side to side
in combat, wrong footing his opponent. A rider with this skill
always strikes first in close combat against dismounted opponents.
When charged by an opponent, or otherwise fighting an enemy also
entitled to strike first, attacks are carried out in order of Initiative. If
Initiative is equal, the model with greater experience strikes first.
Running Dismount. The rider is able to dismount from his mount
at speed. The rider may ride up to the mount’s normal move
distance and then dismount immediately. No further movement or
shooting is possible. This skill may be used to move into contact
with the enemy, counting as a Diving Charge from a height of 2" –
all usual rules for diving charges apply. Note that the rider then
counts as dismounted, gaining no further assistance from his mount.
Warriors without Ride may not use this skill.
Athletic Mount. Without breaking stride, the warrior is able to leap
onto the back of his mount and immediately spur it into a full gallop.
Once the warrior is aboard, the mount may make a run or charge
move as normal. The warrior must be within 2" of his steed to use
this skill.
Mounted Combat Master. The rider is especially skilled at combat
against a mounted opponent. The model may re-roll failed 'to hit' rolls
in combat against mounted opponents.

#### Clan Eshin Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Art of Silent Death: The Skaven has patiently mastered the deadly
art of open-hand fighting, as taught by the mystics of Cathay in the
temples of the far East. In hand-to-hand combat, the Skaven can
fight with his bare paws without any penalties and counts as having
two weapons (i.e., +1 attack). In addition, a Skaven Hero with this
skill will cause a critical hit on a To Wound roll of 5-6 instead of
just 6. This skill may be used in conjunction with the Eshin Fighting
Claws (+2 Attacks instead of +1).
Play Dead: Sometimes strange things happen when people have the
misfortune of running into Skaven. A clearly dead corpse is not
there anymore after the fight is over, or dropped weapons or
treasures have disappeared. As well as being taught to roll with the
blows, these characters are taught to feign death. When avoiding the
full effects of a potentially lethal blow they play dead so they can
escape undetected later. The character may re-roll a result on the
serious injury table.

#### Clan Moulder Special Skill

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Beast Master: Any animals (giant rats, rat wolves, and rat ogres) in
the same warband as the Skaven with this skill are treated as having
a +1 bonus to their Leadership.

strengthened until is a frightening addition to his physical makeup.
He may grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks
by –1, down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which
attack his opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns.


#### Clan Pestilens Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Censer Bearer: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Black
Hunger special skill may choose the Censer Bearer special skill. A
Clan Pestilens member with this skill is called Censer Bearer. He
gains the special rule Frenzy and the only weapon he may use in
close combat is a censer.
Contagious: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Rotten Body
special skill may choose the Contagious special skill. A model who
inflicts an injury in close combat that send the contagious member
of the Clan Pestilens out of combat must take a Toughness test. Roll
a D6. If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking
the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always
inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this
test.
Diseased Visage: The follower of the Plagued Ones with this
attribute has obtained a body and face covered in oozing sores and
legions so horrible, that the model causes fear.
Ignore Pain: Only a Clan Pestilens member with the Resilient
strength skill may choose the Ignore Pain special skill. A Clan
Pestilens member with this skill treats "Stunned" injuries as
"Knocked Down".
Rotten Body: A Clan Pestilens member with this skill has grown
accustomed to poisons, diseases and the fog of death emanated by
censers. He is now immune to poisons and diseases and, if taken out
of combat because of a failed test for wielding a censer, he will not
have to roll for injuries at the end of the battle, recovering
automatically.
Unholy Chant: Once per battle, the model with this skill may start
an Unholy Chant. This chant causes all Skaven in the warband to
immediately pass all Leadership-based tests in the turn the chant is
uttered, including Rout tests.

#### Clan Skryre Special Skills

Black Hunger: The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black
Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him unnatural strength and
speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The
Hero may add +1 attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for
the duration of his own turn but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no
armor save possible at the end of the turn.
Tail Fighting: The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword
with its tail. The model gains an extra attack with the appropriate
weapon or a +1 bonus to its armor save.
Wall Runner: The Skaven may use their running distance when traversing
walls rather than their base movement. They may also attempt to climb laterally,
needing Initiative tests for every 2" of movement.
Infiltration: A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Excellent Engineer: The Skryre Engineer with this skill is
constantly working on the black powder and Warplock weapons of
the warband. Any black powder or Warplock weapons owned by the
Skaven in the warband have their range increased by +6”.
Warp Magic (magic user only): The Skaven may now uses magic
from the any Skaven magic list or Lesser Magic List.

#### Dark Elf Special Skills

Draich Master: The hero has chosen the aspect of the Executioner
as his primary focus. The hero can wield a double-handed sword
without the usual penalty of striking last, and is allowed to wear
Heavy or Ithilmar armor (note that he may not wear Gromril
armor; what kind of Elf would wear Dwarf-made armor,
anyways?). [Skill by Julian Hellstrom]
Fey Quickness: Few can ever hope to match an Elf ’s inhuman
quickness and agility. An Elf with Fey Quickness can avoid melee
or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the Elf also has Step Aside or
Dodge this will increase to a 4+ in the relevant area. For example,
an Elf with Fey Quickness and Step Aside avoids melee attacks on a
4+ and missile attacks on a 6.
Infiltration: The Dark Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have
models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the lowest roll sets
up first.
Master of Poisons: The Dark Elf is proficient in concocting
different poisons. If the Hero doesn’t search for rare items, he may
make D3-1 doses of Dark Venom instead. There is a chance of
getting none, as the hero doesn’t have access to a stable workplace.
The poison must be used in the next battle and cannot be sold or
traded to other warbands as the Dark Elves guard their secrets very
carefully.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf and is
capable of feats of strength. A warrior with this skill may choose
skills from the Strength table. The Sorceress may never take this
skill and no more than two warriors in the warband may take this
skill at any one time.
Murderer: The Dark Elf may always choose to attack _incapacitated_ 
foes even if there are standing foes in combat with them.


#### Dwarf Special Skills

Master of Blades: This Dwarf’s martial skills surpass those of a
normal warrior; he has fought unscathed against hordes of Orcs and
Goblins. When using a weapon that has a Parry special rule, this
hero parries successfully if he beats or matches his opponents
highest ‘to hit’ roll, not just if he beats the roll. In addition, if this
warrior is using two weapons that have the Parry special rule, he is
allowed to parry two attacks (if his two dice match or beat the two
highest Attack dice against him) instead of the normal maximum of
one. Note that if this Dwarf has two Dwarf axes (as detailed above)
he can re-roll any failed parries.
Extra Tough: This Dwarf is notorious for walking away from
wounds that would kill a lesser being. When rolling on the Heroes
Serious Injury chart for this Hero after a game in which he has been
taken Out Of Action, the dice may be re-rolled once. The result of
this second dice roll must be accepted, even if it is a worse result.
Resource Hunter: This Dwarf is especially good at locating
valuable resources. When rolling on the Exploration chart at the end
of a game, the Hero may modify one dice roll by +1/-1.
True Grit: Dwarfs are hardy individuals and this Hero is hardy
even for a Dwarf! When rolling on the Injury table for this Hero, a
roll of 1-3 is treated as Knocked Down, 4-5 as Stunned, and 6 as Out
Of Action.
Thick Skull: The Hero has a thick skull, even for a Dwarf. He has a
3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made, treat a
Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Dwarf also wears a
helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of the
normal Helmet special rule).
Diplomatic: The Dwarf no longer suffers from Hatred.


#### Halfling Special Skills

Quiet as a Mouse: The Halfling as adept at staying as quiet as a
mouse whilst hiding. Enemy warriors must use half their initiative
value in inches (rounded down) when trying to detect this hidden
Halfling.
Crude Belch: Having eaten a meal or six, this Halfling may release
a withering belch to distract his enemies. During the first round of
hand to hand combat the Halfling can release his noxious fumes
upon all enemies within base contact. All enemies affected must
take a leadership test. If the leadership test is failed then the putrid
odour has severely affected the warrior's fighting ability and he must
miss his first attack (regardless of whether he has only one attack or
not).
Skilled Huntsman: The Halfling has been hunting things ever since
he was young (the more food he has, the better!) and has become
well adapted to firing as silently and discreetly as possible. To
represent this a Halfling may try and fire a ranged weapon and
remain hidden. When shooting from hiding roll D6. On a 3+ the
Halfling has managed to keep his actions inconspicuous to the eye
of the enemy and may remain hidden that turn. Note this skill may
not be combined with black powder weapons, they are just too
noisy!
Layers of Fat: The Halfling has gained mountains of flab during his
vast experience of eating fine foods and his thick bulk could
swallow a sword whole! The Halfling always has a basic saving
throw of 6 regardless of the enemy warrior's strength and on top of
any armor he already wears.
Shifty: The Halfling has long-been skirting in the shadows,
avoiding unwanted attention. So nimble is he that he may surprise
even those who believe they've got them dead-to-rights. The
Halfling gains a bonus attack when charged that strikes first.
Wily Thief: If the Halfling takes any enemy out of action and
doesn’t go out of action himself, the warband gains an extra piece of
Wyrdstone (in addition to his Cutpurse piece. See Halfling thief)
Stealthy: The Halfling can hide even after running, and can run
while within 8” of the enemy.

#### Hobgoblin Special Skills

Charge Stoppa: A hobgoblin with this skill can deliver a huge
surprise to a charging opponent. When an opponent charges the
hobgoblin he can immediately make a free attack with a missile
weapon. If the hobgoblin’s strike causes him an injury, the attacker
is stopped halfway through his charge. For example, if the charge
would have been 8”, the hobgoblin’s strike would stop the attacker
at 4 inches. Unfortunately for the hobgoblin, if his assailant does
succeed in his charge, the hobgoblin cannot use hand-to-hand
combat weapons during that round. He can use his fist however.
Ded Shooty: Hobgoblins are famed masters of the bow, and their
steady aim allows them to fire with uncanny accuracy while on the
move. This skill allows a hobgoblin to ignore movement penalties
when shooting. Hobgoblins riding giant wolves can use this skill as
well, suffering no penalties to movement while firing from
wolfback.
Ded Sneaky: These sneaky hobgoblins have been trained as scouts,
sneaking up close to the enemy to deliver a deadly strike or observe
the enemy positions for their leaders. A hobgoblin with this skill is
placed after all other models have been placed. He can be placed
anywhere on the table, as long as he’s at least 12” from any
opponent’s models.
Backstabba: The hobgoblins are a tricky breed, and take advantage
of any opportunity in combat. A hobgoblin with this skill can make
a surprise attack on his opponent from a direction he isn’t expecting.
The attack is in addition to the hobgoblin’s normal attacks, but
cannot be parried.

#### Kislev Ranger Skills

Animal Call: If hidden, the Ranger may use animal calls to
confound the enemies. Any enemy model that is within 18” of the
Ranger and does not declare a charge in its movement phase must
take a Leadership test (determine which models these are after
charges are declared but before they are moved). Those that fail the
Ranger may move in any direction she wishes instead of their
normal move.
Herb Lore: The Ranger has learned basic herb lore to cure injuries.
Any friendly model in base-to-base contact with her may have 1
wound restored on a roll of 4+ in the recovery phase. The ranger
may also heal herself. If any healing is successful, the ranger may
not move this turn, but may shoot as normal. The ranger may not
heal if she is in close combat.

#### Lahmia Special Skills

Swift: when moving the vampire may run but counts as having
moved normally for all purposes.
Transfix: at the start of the combat phase, one enemy model in base
contact must test against Leadership. If the test is failed, the model
may not attack that turn and all attacks against it gain an additional
+1 to hit. Ineffective against models immune to psychology.
Quickblood: the vampire's lightning reflexes give it an
unmodifiable 6+ save against all wounds. This save is in addition to
and taken before normal armor saves. Note that in the case of
critical hits this save is taken before rolling to see if multiple
wounds are taken. If the vampire acquires Dodge or Step Aside,
those skills supercede this one and cannot be combined to produce a
4+ save. Hence, a vampire with Quickblood and Dodge has a 5+
save against missiles and 6+ against close combat.
Innocence Lost: the vampire's ability to appear virginal and
innocent temporarily disarms her opponent. The vampire always
attacks first in close combat. If an enemy model also has the ability
to attack first, then decide in order of initiative. In case of equal
initiative, the highest score on 1d6 goes first. This skill is ineffective
against models immune to psychology.
Seduction: The vampire must test against Leadership at the start of
the combat phase. If successful, one enemy model in base contact
must also save against Leadership. If failed, the model is controlled
by the vampire player. The model's original owner may attempt to
regain control in each subsequent turn by testing again in his
recovery phase. If the vampire chooses to attack the controlled
model, control is lost immediately. If the model ends the game
under vampire control, they count as out of action. A maximum of
one model may be so controlled. Ineffective against models immune
to psychology.
Night Creature: the vampire blends effortlessly into the
background. Models wishing to charge, shoot or cast spells at the
vampire must roll 4+ to do so, or choose another target. This skill is
only effective if the vampire did not move in its previous movement
phase.


#### Marks of Chaos

Mark of Chaos Undivided: Models with the Mark of Chaos Undivided
gain +1 Leadership. This may take them above 10.

Mark of Khorne: Heroes bearing the Mark of Khorne gain Frenzy, and a 5+
ward save against the effects of spells. A Warband containing one or more
of this mark may never form Formal Alliances.

Mark of Nurgle: The Model gains +1 Toughness, +1 Wound, but loses
1 point of Movement and 1 point of Initiative. They are now 
immune to the effects of Plague Victims. These bonuses also
apply to any War Beast or Monstrous Mount the rider may have, though 
it will lose 2 points of movement rather than 1 as it has to contend with
its own decrepitude as well as the increased weight of its rider.

Mark of Slaanesh: Enemy models that wish to charge a character with the
Mark of Slaanesh must first pass a successful Leadership test or 
the charge is failed. Enemies are additionally at -1 to hit in melee.
The character gains Stupidity.

Mark of Tzeentch: The hero immediately learns all spells from Chaos
Rituals and may cast spells in armour. Any roll of a double will miscast.

#### Musicians Skills


Minstrel: The musician is a masterful taleteller and gains extra
income for the warband. If the Musician was not taken out of action they
may earn an additional 2d6 gold after the game.

GET PUMPED: The musician has mastered energetic music that stirrs
the blood of any who listen, inspiring them to feats of courage that would
normally rattle them if they had time to think about it. Warriors within
12" become Immune to Psychology.

Rally: Even the most crestfallen Warriors will take heart when gathered
around a motivated and uplifting bard. For each allied Warrior within 6"
of the Musician their warband may add +1 Leadership when taking Rout Tests.

Marching Tune: If the Musician forms a unit with five or more allies they
may all add 1 to their base movement as long as they remain together. 

Deafening racket: A musician may choose to make a deafening racket in
each of their shooting phases. If they choose to do so then until their
next shooting phase all non-Musicians friend or foe within 8" reduce their
Leadership by 1. This effect stacks.



#### Mutations

Those who dwell in Mordheim soon develop horrible mutations, and
the Cult of the Possessed seem to be especially susceptible. In
addition, Mordheim attracts mutants from all over the Empire, who
are always quick to join the Chaos covens. Most mutations are
simply inconvenient or hideous, but some make their bearers
extremely dangerous in combat.
Mutations may be bought for a Mutant or a Possessed warrior only
when they are recruited; you may not buy new mutations for a
model after recruitment. Any Mutant or Possessed may have one or
more mutations. The first mutation is bought at the price indicated,
but second and subsequent mutations bought for the same model
cost double.
Daemon soul: A Daemon lives within the mutant’s soul. This gives
him a 4+ save against the effects of spells or prayers.
Cost: 20 gold crowns.
Great claw: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra
attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus.
Cost: 50 gold crowns.
Cloven hoofs: The warrior gains +1 Movement.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Tentacle: One of the mutant’s arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by -1,
down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack his
opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Blackblood: If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit (no critical hits)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
Cost: 30 gold crowns
Spines: Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat
phase. Spines will never cause critical hits.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
Scorpion tail: The mutant has a long barbed tail with a venomed
tip, allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each hand-to-
hand combat phase. If the model hit by the tail is immune to poison,
the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Extra arm: The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in the
extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand
combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or a buckler in the extra
arm. If a Possessed chooses to do this, he gains an extra attack but
still cannot carry a weapon.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
Hideous: The mutant causes fear. See the Psychology section for
details.
Cost: 40 gold crowns


#### Norse Special Skill

Shield Master: Norse warriors begin training with shields when
they are still children. Some warriors become so skilled with these
weapons that they can block almost any blow against them. When
this hero is armed with a shield he may parry with it in addition to
getting a 6+ save.
Berserk Charge: The Norse are very skilled with weapons that
many other races see as primitive and savage. When this hero is
armed with an axe or double handed weapon, he may re-roll all
failed to hit rolls when he charges.
Crushing Blow: Norse warriors train in almost all of their spare
time. They are expert fighters and learn to put all of their strength
into very powerful attacks. No enemy may parry an attack made by
this hero because it strikes with such power that it pushes right
through a buckler or sword.
Battle Tongue: Only a hero with the leader skill may gain this skill.
It allows models within 12" of him use his leadership, rather than
the normal 6".
Barbarian Courage: As Norse warriors strive to die bravely in
battle, they learn to fear nothing and embrace hardship. This hero
never needs to take all alone tests and may re-roll failed fear tests.

#### Orcs Special Skills

’ard ead: The warrior has a thick skull even for an Orc. He has a
special 3+ save on a D6 to avoid being Stunned. If the save is made,
treat a Stunned result as Knocked Down instead. If the Orc also
wears a helmet, this save is 2+ instead of 3+ (this takes the place of
the normal helmet special rule).
Waaagh!: Orcs are aggressive creatures and some are experts at
bulldozing charges. The warrior may add +D3" to his charge range.
’ere we go!: Orcs often charge even the most fearsome opponents.
The model may ignore Fear and Terror tests when charging.
da cunnin’ plan: Only the Boss may have this skill. The warband
may re-roll any failed Rout tests as long as the Boss is not Out Of
Action.
well ’ard (Greenskin warband only): The Orc has a thick, dark-
green skin, possibly indicating Black Orc blood. Such is the
toughness of the Orc that he may add +1 to any armor saves.
Proven Warrior (Black Orc Warband only): This young warrior
has proven himself worthy of his Black Orc heritage. This skill may
only be taken by a Young’un with the Black Orc blood ability and
25 experience. Once he gains this skill, the model is now considered
a full Black Orc Warrior (yet still retains the title of Young’un). He
follows all the rules for Black Orcs and uses their equipment list and
has access to the same skill lists as a Black Orc.
’eadbasher: Orcs have massive physical strength and some of them
even learn to aim their blows at the heads of their opponents, with
obvious results. Any Knocked Down results which the Orc causes in
hand-to-hand count as Stunned results instead.

#### Ostlanders Special Skills

Bull Rush: This warrior is huge, even by Ostlander standards, and
can use his massive girth to overpower his opponents. When he
charges, this Hero may attempt to knock down his opponent rather
than making his normal attacks. Roll to hit once with a +1 to hit
modifier, though no ‘to wound’ roll is necessary. Instead, if the
warrior hits with this attack, the opposing model is Knocked Down.
(Models with the Bull Rush skill should have a suitably large beer-
belly modeled out of putty whenever possible.)
Foul Odor: Ostlanders are one and all prodigious drinkers and none
too hygienic! This warrior rises head and shoulders above the rest.
After a lifetime of drinking, liquor has little effect on him any
more... not that this stops him from consuming massive quantities!
His unwashed clothes and sweat reek of alcohol and all living
enemies (not Undead or Possessed) are at -1 to hit him in hand-to-
hand combat. In addition, the warrior cannot carry any open flames
(torch, lantern, etc.) and fire attacks made against him are resolved
at +1 Strength as his beer soaked clothing burns readily.
Taunt: After years of baiting opponents into drunken brawls the
Ostlander has learned some of most vile insults in the Empire.
During the shooting phase the warrior may choose to taunt one
enemy instead of shooting with a missile weapon or casting a spell.
The warrior must be able to see the enemy and taunting follows all
the LOS rules for shooting (you must taunt the nearest opponent,
etc.). The player should insult the enemy model in some manner
whenever possible (perhaps his hat looks like a strangled parrot or
his mother was a Bretonnian.). The enemy then takes a Leadership
test. If he passes, nothing happens but if he fails he must spend his
next movement phase trying to get into close combat with the
warrior who taunted him.
Animal Friendship: Having grown up amidst the animals of the
forest this warrior exudes a certain charm to all ‘normal’ animals
(i.e. warhorses, Warhounds, etc.). Animals will never attack him and
up to two War dogs (see Mordheim book, page 54) that the warrior
owns do not count against the maximum number of models in the
Warband.
Blood Oath: The leader of an Ostlander Warband sometimes takes
a Blood Oath never to leave any of his fallen ‘family’ members
behind. Such is his determination to protect his fallen Blood-kin that
it is extremely difficult to cause him to Rout from the field. Only a
Warband’s leader may have this skill, which allows him to re-roll a
single Rout test once per game.


#### Pit Fighters Special Skills

Force of Will: When the Pit Fighter loses his last wound and is
taken OOA, he must roll a D6 equal or under his Toughness, each
following round he has to roll again on his toughness but then with a
-1 modifier for each subsequent round. If he succeeds he gets up and
may continue to fight, when he gets taken Out -of-Action a second
time he’ll be removed as normal.
Arms master: The Pit Fighter may now ignore all ‘difficult to use’
rules for all weapons, this enables him to combine certain types of
weapons, he can combine a Morning Star with buckler, or even a
Morning Star with a Morning Star.
Body Slam: Instead of making a normal charge the Pit Fighter may
attempt to slam his opponent to the ground, he burrows his shoulder
deep into his opponent’s stomach. Instead of making his normal
attacks the Pit fighter may make a single attack resolved as
following: +1Str, +1 to Hit, no weapon bonuses or abilities. Critical
hit on a 5+.
Grizzled Veteran: The Pit Fighter is used to fighting fearsome
monsters and being cornered in the Pit when there's no escape. He
has been close to death so many times that he has made his peace
and the thought of Death no longer bothers him. The Pit Fighter is
immune to all psychology.


#### Sisters of Sigmar Special Skills

Sign of Sigmar: The Sister is favoured by the great god Sigmar.
Possessed or Undead opponents lose their first attack against the
Priestess in the first round of hand-to-hand combat (down to a
minimum of 1).
Protection of Sigmar: The Sister has been blessed by the High
Matriarch. Any spell which would affect her is nullified on a D6 roll
of 4+. Note that if the spell is nullified it will not affect any other
models either.
Utter Determination: Only the Matriarch may have this skill,
which allows her to re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Righteous Fury: The Sister feels cold fury and utter contempt
towards any evil that pollutes the soil of the holy Empire with its
presence. The model hates all Skaven, Undead or Possessed
warbands and all models in them.
Absolute Faith: The Sister puts her faith in Sigmar, and faces
dangers unflinchingly. She may re-roll any Fear tests and does not
have to test if she is fighting alone against several opponents.

#### Shadow Warrior Special Skills

Infiltration: A Shadow Warrior with this skill is always placed on
the battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed
anywhere on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing
warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both
players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for each, and the
lowest roll sets up first.
See in Shadows: The warrior’s senses have become especially keen
from years spent walking the shadows. As long as he has movement
to reach them, the warrior may always roll to charge opponents he
cannot see (instead of the normal 4").
Hide in Shadows: Over time Shadow Warriors have learned how to
freeze in place and remain undetected, even from the heightened
senses of their Dark Elf cousins. An enemy warrior attempting to
detect this warrior when he is Hidden must halve his Initiative
before measuring the distance.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Elf, and is
capable of feats of strength not often seen among the people of
Ulthuan. A warrior with this skill may choose skills from the
Strength skills table from now on. This skill may not be taken by
Shadow Weavers. There may never be more than two Elves with
this skill in the warband at any one time.
Master of Runes: The Shadow Weaver has learned to harness the
power of the High Elven runes of power (see Elven Runestones,
below) to a degree few mages attain. When using Elven Runestones,
the mage is +1 to his dispel roll. In addition, the mage can inscribe
the weapons and armor of one of his fellow warriors with Elven
runes. One member of the Warband may re-roll a single failed
armor save or Parry roll once per battle. After a single battle, the
runes lose their glamour and must be redone. This skill may only be
taken by Shadow Weavers.


#### Troll Slayer Special Skills

Ferocious Charge: The Slayer may double his attacks on the turn
that he charges. He will suffer a -1 to hit penalty on that turn.
Monster Slayer: The Slayer always wounds any opponent on a roll
of 4+, regardless of Toughness, unless his own Strength (after all
modifiers due to weapon bonuses, etc) would mean that a lower roll
than this is needed.
Berserker: The Slayer may add +1 to his close combat to hit rolls
during the turn which he charges. (may not be used with Ferocious
Charge).
Sweeping strike: The slayer may make get an extra attack for each
enemy model in base contact, if he is engaged by more than 1
model, up to a total of ten attacks.
Tattoos of Grimnir: The Slayer is tattooed by one of the Priests of
Grimnir the Brave, the God of Slayers. The model now has a 6+
ward save. You may take this skill again increased to 5+ and so on,
up to 3+. (The Slayer is then covered in tattoos!).
Fated: The Slayer is destined not to die easily. You may re-roll any
result on the Serious Injury table. The second result stands, even if it
is worse than the first one.

#### Von Carstein Special Skills

Transfixing Glare: The Vampire is able to hypnotize a victim using
his glowing red eyes, the victim will remain passive and wait for the
Vampire to close. The Glare may be used on any living model in
base contact that is not Immune to Psychology. The victim must
pass a Leadership test on a 2D6 or be transfixed. A transfixed model
may not attack in close combat and is treated as being Knocked
Down for purpose of being attacked. Roll for the Glare at the start of
the combat phase.
Mist Form: A Vampire's human form is only one of many and a
few can transform into a thin mist in the recovery phase. While in
this state the Vampire has a move of 2D6" per turn. He may not
attack in close combat, shoot with a missile weapon or cast spells
and he gains no protection from armor. All to hit rolls against the
Vampire need a natural '6' to hit and all to wound rolls need a
natural '6 '. Note that this may not be modified by any bonuses as it
represents the protection of a non-physical form. The Vampire may
reduce the injury roll by -2. If the Vampire is Knocked Down he
immediately reverts to his physical form. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form in any subsequent recovery phase by choice.
Ratswarm Form: Some Vampires hold a sway over nature and they
can transform into animals such as a wolf, a swarm of rats or a giant
bat. A Vampire can change form in the recovery phase regardless of
whether the Vampire is Knocked Down or Stunned but he suffers all
penalties for standing up for example. The Vampire may change
back to Vampire form at the start of any subsequent recovery phase.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ratswarm Form 6 3 0 3 3 * * 4 *
While in Ratswarm form the Vampire may not use weapons and
does not receive any protection from armor. He cannot shoot with a
missile weapon or cast spells but can attack in close combat without
a penalty for fighting without a weapon. The Vampire should be
represented by a Ratswarm base but treat the Vampire as being the
size of a single rat for moving through alleys or similar small
spaces. The Vampire may move through small holes and gaps that
would allow a single rat-sized creature to pass through and can thus
move through walls as most have a small holes in them.
Bat Form: Many Vampires can transform into giant bats. A
Vampire can change form in exactly the same manner as detailed
above.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Bat Form 8 3 0 3 2 * * 1 *
Whilst in Bat form the Vampire may fly and ignores movement
penalties, he cannot run as such but may move double distance and a
charge move is also doubled. The Vampire may not use weapons

#### Wardancer Skill List

Aerial Fury: Instead of making a normal charge the Wardancer
may use the Aerial Fury skill. If the Wardancer passes an initiative
test he may jump into combat with the same effects as a diving
charge. This attack can be made from ground level and does not
have to be made from a higher position as per normal diving charge
as the Wardancer simply leap up and brings death to his foes from
above.
Blade Master: The Wardancer is a master of the dance and his skill
with his twin blades is legendary. This allows the Wardancer to use
his second blade to re-roll his parry attempt in the same way as a
buckler though still gaining a +1 attack bonus.
I Shall Fight: Who I Please - With this ability the Wardancer may
charge any enemy within range and line of sight regardless of
models intercepting. Opponent’s clumsy attempts to intercept the
Wardancer are easily dodged or even leapt over.
Ritual Trance: The Warrior puts himself into a ritual chance before
the battle begins. The warrior is utterly fearless and has an undying
lust for combat. The warrior is immune to all psychology.

#### Wood Elf Special Skills

Luck. The Wood Elf is blessed by Lileath, the Elven goddess of
luck. Once per game he may re-roll any dice roll he makes (but not
one made by other members of the warband).
Masterful Ricochet: Learning to ricochet arrows is a life's work for
even an Elven archer - but learning to do so within the contorted and
irregular shapes of Athel Loren is a whole new level of mastery. The range
of the Ricochet critical hit effect is increased to 12" and ignores line of
sight.
Fey protection: The flow of the forest of Athel Loren is a bit
stronger in this warrior and offer a degree of protection against the
winds of magic. The Elven warrior receives a Save of 4+ against the
effect of any magic that affects him or her.
Fey Quickness: Few mortal beings can ever hope it match an Elf ́s
quickness and agility. An Elven warrior with this skill can avoid
hand-to-hand combat or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the warrior
also has the Step Aside or Dodge skill this will increase the special
save to 4+ in the relevant area (IE a warrior with Step Aside avoids
hand-to-hand combat attacks on 4+ and missile attacks on 6+).
Powerful Build: The warrior is strongly built for an Wood Elf, and
is capable of feats of strength not often seen among the Wood Elf. A
warrior with this skill may choose skills from the Strength skill table
from now on, in addition to his other skill tables. There may bever
be more than two Wood Elf with this skill in the warband at any one
time.
Infiltration: A Wood Elf with this skill is always placed on the
battlefield after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing warband and
more than 12” from any enemy model. The Scout may set up hidden
if you wish. If both players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6
for each, and the lowest roll sets up first.
Asrai Archery: The Wood Elf does not suffer -1 penalty for
moving and shooting.
Sniper: Gains the Sniper special rule.
Hide in Shadow: enemy attempting to detect a Wood Elf with this
skill must halve his inniative
Confused: Gains the Hatred rule of all Forest Spirits.
