# Optional Rules



This section includes a variety of rules that add an extra dimension to your battles in Mordheim. As they are additions to the basic rules they are not an essential part of the game, and you should agree with your opponents beforehand whether you are going to use any of them. 

We recommend that new players ignore this section to begin with, at least until you are familiar with the way the game works. If you consider yourself to be an experienced gamer then you’ll have no problem incorporating these elements. Some of these additional rules alter the game quite dramatically, and you are under no obligation to use any of them. They have simply been included for players who want to explore different aspects of the game. 

## Random Happenings

Mordheim is a dark and sinister city – dangers lurk around every corner. Even the basic laws of nature cannot be relied upon. These rules represent the weird and wonderful things that can happen in Mordheim which are beyond the control of players. These rules are intended to be optional and should only be used if agreed on by all players taking part. 

To determine if a random encounter occurs, roll a D6 at the start of each player’s turn. A result of 1 indicates a random encounter. Roll a D66 for the random encounter on the chart opposite to see what exactly is encountered and follow the directions. 

The player whose turn it is places any models that represent the encounter. From now on these encounters will act before each of that player's turns (though that player doesn’t control their actions - see the individual descriptions to see how the models act). This player is known as the ‘Encountering Player’, even though random encounters will frequently affect all players indiscriminately. The models that represent a random encounter must all be placed within 6" of a randomly determined board edge and  if a group rather than an individual they will remain within 2" of another member of their group wherever possible. 

Random encounter members must be placed (and will remain, unless their description indicates otherwise) at ground level. The Encountering Player places the model(s) representing the random encounter, but note that they cannot initially be placed within 8" of any warband models. After being placed, neutral monsters will travel as quickly as possible (without running) towards the nearest warband model. For this purpose the nearest model is the model that the encounter can reach most quickly and encounter models will never climb the sides of a building to get at a warband member unless that is the only possible target. What each encounter model does from there is listed in its description. 

Note that multiple charging models will engage as many warband members as they can reach, ganging up if some of them can’t reach different models. 

```

## Random Encounters Chart

Roll D66

### 11. Ogre Mercenary

An Ogre Mercenary (see the Ostlander section of the Mordheim rules for stats, equipped with a Two-handed Weapon) appears further down the street. Sensing trouble brewing he decides to seize the opportunity to offer his services to the Encountering Player's warband! The warband that he 'offers' to help gains control of the Ogre for the rest of the game, though he does not count as being a member of your warband for the purposes of warband size or rout tests. At the end of the game the Ogre demands payment for services rendered. The warband that he joined must pay a total of 60gc. 

If the warband cannot (or will not) pay him, he leaves, but not before taking out his frustration on a random member of the warband (only roll among members of the warband who were not taken out of action during the game). Roll for injuries to this unfortunate member just as if he had been taken out of action. If the warband did pay the Ogre they may keep him on as a henchman who will gain experience in the usual way, though will demand a further 15g BEFORE each battle and his equipment may not be sold. If the owning player fails to pay the Ogre before a battle he will leave the warband at no further penalty.



### 12. Swarm of Rats

Something in the sewers has frightened the rats that live there. The rats are in a hurry to get away and will attack anything that stands in their way. Use a template 80mm x 120mm to represent the rats. Six monster bases (use rat swarms if you have them), placed in a rectangle with one short side representing the front, will do nicely. The rats move 2D6" each turn. They will always move forward down the centre of the street and if they come to an intersection roll randomly to determine which direction they take (example: for a normal four-way cross-intersection roll a D6: 1-2 right, 3-4 straight forward, 5-6 left). The rats cannot be engaged in close combat and if they make contact with a model they will run right over him. Any model moved over by the rats will suffer D6 Strength 2 hits, normal armour saves apply. 

### 13. Thinning Air

An explosion that rocks the flagstones mercifully taking place some way away, but bursting up from beneath the earth is a noxious and polluted cloud of toxic Wyrdstone dust. Drifting over the battlefield the dust is carried upwards and away by the wind almost as if magnetised to the sinister green moon of Morrslieb. Warriors must get low to the ground to escape these clouds, lest its deadly particles infest their lungs. For D3 game turns any warrior that ends their movement phase on the second story or higher of a building must take a Toughness test or suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed.

### 14. Aetherstorm

Reality isn't quite as consistent a thing in the wyrdstone-infected atmosphere of Mordheim. Even the stone seems to distort and flex under particular concentrations of the crystals, unwary adventurers finding themselves looking back over their shoulder to see their surroundings nothing like what they were mere moments ago as existence folds in on itself. Select two random buildings on the battlefield. In their movement phase models inside the building are immediately transported into the other building - they may not charge or shoot in that turn as they struggle to reorient themselves and ensure they don't end up warping inside a wall. The owning player may choose where in the building the models are transported to, but this may not place them in combat with enemy models. The Aetherstorm lasts for D3 turns.

### 15. Blood for the Blood God!

Unfortunately for the warbands involved, the scent of blood has attracted the attention of one of Khorne’s minions. Reality is breached as a vicious Bloodletter emerges from the Realm of Chaos to shed even more blood for its master. The Bloodletter has the characteristics in the Monsters of Mordheim section.   
**Special Rule:** The Bloodletter will stay for D6 turns after which it will disappear. 

### 16. Lucky Find

One random model selected from all warbands, on his feet and not in hand-to-hand combat or
fleeing, has stumbled upon a shard of wyrdstone! Assuming he
doesn’t go out of action, this is added to any other shards the
warband finds after the game. If he is taken out of action in close
combat, the enemy model steals the shard away! Note that only non-
animal models can find or steal a shard, not Dire Wolves, Hunting
Dogs, etc.

### 21. Restless Spirit

Countless unfortunates have suffered agonising deaths in many forms since the comet crashed into the city. Not all of these individuals can easily accept their new condition and they refuse to rest. Perhaps they left some important task unfinished or seek revenge on those who did them harm. The warbands have stumbled upon one such ghost.  

Any warband member who is within 8" of the spirit at the start of its Movement phase must make a Leadership test or flee (exactly as if he were fleeing from combat). Models that are immune to psychology automatically pass this test. This creature is unable to affect (or be affected by) the physical world, but it is very frightening nonetheless. The spirit moves 4" per turn towards the opposite edge of the board, moving through walls, obstacles or warband members as if they were not there. It will not charge and cannot be harmed by the warband members in any way. 

The only exception to this is if the spirit comes into contact with a Sigmarite Matriarch or a Warrior- Priest of Sigmar. These models may choose to put the dead to rest. If the player controlling such a model decides to do this, the spirit is immediately banished (disappears and does not return) and the priest gains one Experience point. 
```
```
### 22. Burning Building

Suddenly, one of the buildings (chosen at random) bursts into flames, ignited by smouldering embers from a fire thought extinguished long ago. Any models inside take a S3 hit unless they move outside in that turn and any models within 2" of the walls take a S2 hit from the smoke and heat unless they move further away as well at the end of their movement phase. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause fear due to the intense flames and anyone who wishes to enter it must first pass a Fear test exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing enemy. 

### 23. Man-Eater

One of the trees growing in the area has been changed into a carnivorous predator by exposure to the Chaos magic inundating the area. Randomly determine which member of the Encountering Player’s warband finds the plant. That model is attacked as a large mouth opens up in the trunk of the tree and its branches whip down to grab its unfortunate victim. Place a tree next to the victim. He is now considered to be in close combat with the tree, which has the following characteristics: 

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Tree |0| 3| 0|4 |6| 3| 3| 2| 10|

The tree automatically passes any Leadership tests it is required to make. Any result on the Injury table will cause the Man-Eater to stop attacking, though it is not possible to actually take it out of action or knock it down. Opponents are +1 to hit the tree, due to the fact that it is rooted to the spot! It is also Flammable, and you will gain +1 Experience for wounding it.



### 24. Skeletons

While the intense magic of the area rapidly dissolves skeletons to dust, shambling hordes of them spring up at random from the bones of the fallen. Uncontrolled, they roam the city wasteland, blindly attacking everything they find before falling apart. 

Use the Profile of the Skeleton in the Lahmian warband section. 2D6 Skeletons appear, armed with daggers. The skeletons will move towards and attack the closest models as quickly as possible. Taking the Skeletons Out of Action does not award experience.

### 25. The Twisting of the Air

Reality itself seems to twist, warping perceptions until no one can be sure of what their senses tell them. Roll a D6 at the start of each player’s turn. For the next D3 game turns, all distances between models are considered to be increased by that same D6" roll for purposes of All Alone tests, benefitting from the leader's leadership, weapon ranges, and charging. Note that the actual models are not moved, but only the shooting/charging model’s perception of the distance. Nor does it effect regular movement. 

\page

### 26. Spawn

The warbands have stumbled upon one of the many former inhabitants of the city that got too close to the crater at the centre of the city and were turned into a mindless spawn. The Spawn uses the same statline as a generic Chaos Spawn. 

### 31. Collapsing Building

Pick one building at random. Any models inside must pass an Initiative test or suffer a S5 hit, armour saves applying as normal, as the building collapses. Remove the building from the table (replacing with ruins if possible), and place the models back on the table where it stood. Any models on the roof when it collapses automatically fall from whatever height they were at. Any walkways that were connected to that building are also removed, making any models on top of them at the time automatically fall.

### 32. Scrawling on a Wall

A randomly determined warband member of the Encountering Player's warband who is within 4" of a building (if there are no models this close to a building, re-roll this encounter), sees writing suddenly appear in blood on the wall closest to him. Roll on the following table to find out what the writing says: 

|D6| Result|
|:- | :-: |
|1:| The writings are a map of the area. The model’s warband receives a +1 on the roll to pick the scenario for the next game they take part in.|
|2: |Reading the writing accidentally sets off a spell on the reader. The model suffers a minor curse and now has a -1 penalty to all dice rolls for the rest of the game.|
|3:| The warband member learns of the remains of some booty inside the building. If he moves inside he finds a D6 gold crowns.|
|4: |The writings reveal all the hiding places in the area. The model can hide, even in the open, for rest of the game.|
|5:| The warband member learns of a secret passage inside the building – if he moves inside, he can pop out next turn in any other building.|
|6:|A fun read, but nothing else happens (Useless Jeremy was here!).|

### 33. Energizing Winds

Like a bizarre green version of cocaine the saturation of Wyrdstone dust in the air brings a rush of energy and seemingly endless stamina to the warband members. In the encountering player's turn roll a D3. All characters' base movement for all warbands is increased by that amount for that round turn. The winds last for D3 turns. 

### 34. Light as a Feather

Gravity has not been acting the same recently in this particular area of Mordheim. For the rest of the game all climbing tests and diving charges may be rerolled if unsuccessful, and all falling damage is taken at half strength (rounding up).

```
```
### 35. Dog Pack

Recent events in Mordheim have caused many of the city’s dogs suddenly to find themselves without homes. Groups of these animals have turned feral and formed into hunting packs. The warbands have been discovered by one such (very hungry) pack. The pack consists of 2D3 wild dogs (use the Hunting Dog stats from the Witch Hunter warband list). The dogs move as quickly as they can toward the nearest models, dividing themselves as evenly as they can between multiple targets if they are available. If members of a dog pack take a warband member out of action, he will be eaten if not rescued. If no friendly model comes within 6" of where the model fell by the end of that warband’s next turn, the fallen member is considered lost (dog food). If a dog pack fails a Rout test, they leave without taking their ‘food’ with them, and any warband members taken out of action in the last turn of the game have not been eaten and follow the normal rules for models taken out of action. 

### 36. Possessed!

One randomly selected member of the Encountering Player’s warband is suddenly possessed by a minor spirit. This spirit is far too weak to control the model’s entire body, but is instead limited to controlling one of his or her limbs (usually an arm). The model takes an automatic hit at his or her own Strength during each of his or her Close Combat phases until the possession is over and may do nothing else. The possession lasts D3 game turns. Note that Sigmarite Matriarchs and Warrior-Priests are immune to this possession, as are non-living warband members. If such a warband member is the object of the spirit’s attention, randomly determine another warband member to suffer the effect instead. 



### 41. Sticky Feet

One randomly determined non-mounted member of the encountering player's warband finds themselves adopting strangely adhesive properties. That warband member may now move horizontally along walls as if it was open ground for the rest of the game, as long as they do not enter water. They do not need initiative tests in order to climb down either (though climbing upwards and jumping will still do).

### 42 - 44 Storm of Chaos

Clouds rapidly gather above the city in an unnaturally sickly yellow-green mass, and warp lightning begins to dance from one cloud to another. Thunder reverberates from the ruins' walls, screaming out in almost intelligible noises. The clouds themselves seem to take on the shapes of monstrous creatures and warbands in the conflict look at each other with fear on their faces. Roll a D6 to see what the storm manifestation will bring: 

|D6| Result|
|:- |:-:|
|1| Warp lightning begins to strike the ground in search of a victim. It will hit the warrior with the best armour save, attracted to the large amount of metal. That warrior takes a S5 hit, with no armour save possible. If multiple warriors all have the highest armour save, randomly determine which is struck. The lightning will strike for D3 turns before moving on towards another part of the city.|
|2 |Fish suddenly fall out of the sky to pelt the area! All movement is halved for one turn (due to wet, flapping fish underfoot), but there is no other effect.|
|3 |Wyrdstone dust has mixed with the water vapour in the area and produced the strange looking clouds from which a tainted rain begins to fall. The rain burns flesh and eats into stone and metal. At the end of each player's movement phase, any of their Warriors in the open suffer a Strength 2 hit.|
|4 |A magical ball of lightning forms near the ground, illuminating the area with an eerie greenish glow. It begins to move about the area, drawn to the magical powers from which it feeds. The mass is the size of the small round template, and moves 8" per turn ignoring all terrain, and anything it moves over suffers a S4 hit with no armour saves allowed. Once it hits the wizard, it disappears. |
|5 |A rumbling is heard from overhead, as thunder erupts from the strange clouds. The thunderclaps become more intense and the heavy pulses of air bring warriors to their knees as if they had been hit by cannonballs of solid air. D6 randomly selected models are _knocked down_ by the air bursts. If any of these models are in close combat, all other members of that melee are knocked down as well. |
|6| Tendrils of smoke drift down from the clouds, winding around the heads of members of each warband. Randomly select one Hero from each warband – these warriors have been chosen by rival storm gods as their champions. The chosen models must move towards each other every turn and get into close combat as quickly as possible. Once in combat, they will automatically pass all Leadership tests and will fight until only one remains (the combat will end when one of the models puts his rival out of action). If a warband does not have any Heroes left in play when the storm gods choose their champions, a random Henchman will be chosen from that warband instead. |

### 45. Pit Fighter

This encounter is identical to the Ogre Mercenary encounter before, except the Hired Sword encountered is a Pit Fighter. He has the statline of a Pit King from the Pit Fighter warband and is equipped with a Morningstar, Helmet, and Shield. He has the same fee.

```
```
### 46. Plague of Flies

An enormous cloud of flies appears in the sky and swoops down on the warbands below. All models have an extra -1 to hit penalty when shooting or fighting in close combat as flies buzz around them and into open orifices. The flies remain for D3 game turns and then fly away. 

### 51. Overload
A tense unease sits over Warband members as an imperceptible change is felt, like a sudden increase on air pressure that weighs heavily on the chest and mind. A humidity of something other than water vapour clings to their skin, ears pop, and simply breathing begins to feel weighty and somehow 'wrong'. Only those sensitive to magic will be aware of what's going on, as the Winds of Magic that usually fuel their abilities condense into an overwhelming saturation the likes of which they have never felt before. Channeling the Winds with any degree of safety is all but impossible with so much of it in the area, and like a match in a room full of hydrogen it takes but a single incantation to inadvertantly channel far more power than a Wizard could ever want. For D3 game turns all attempts to cast magic or use bound spells will automatically miscast - there is no need to roll to attempt to cast the spell. If you are using the Hammerheim ruleset, results on the Miscast table will always be "Dimensional Cascade".

### 52. The Horror in the House

Randomly select one warrior lurking alone inside a building (if there are no warband members inside a building, ignore this result and re- roll on the Random Encounters table). Unfortunately for him, he’s not as alone as he thought. He hears a slight ripping sound as if the air itself is being torn apart and something manifests itself behind him. The warrior must take a Fear test and if he fails, in his next Movement phase he will run screaming 2D6" from the building towards the nearest table edge and can do nothing else in that turn. If he passes the test, the unnatural presence still forces him D6" outside, but he suffers no other effects. At the start of his subsequent turn, a fleeing model can try to recover from his ordeal by passing a Leadership test, but at a -1 penalty. If he does, he stops, but cannot do anything else that turn other than catch his breath. If he fails, he again moves 2D6", trying in vain to erase the terrifying images from his memory. For the rest of the game, the building itself will cause fear, and anyone who wishes to enter it must first pass a Fear test exactly as if they wished to charge a fear-causing enemy. 

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


### 53. Plague Victims

Disease is a common occurrence among the few survivors left in the ruins of the city. A group of a D6 citizens has contracted a particularly nasty plague known as Nurgle’s Rot. They move at normal rate (4") towards the nearest warband members, seeking their help. If they come into contact with a warband member, they will not attack, but will instead cling to him as they beseech his aid, hindering him greatly. A model with Plague Victims in contact with him acts as if he had just recovered from being knocked down. If one or more of the Plague Victims is charged, shot at, or otherwise attacked, these pitiful victims will rout immediately. At the end of the game, roll a dice for each warband member in play when the Plague Victims appeared and on a roll of 1, that member has contracted Nurgle’s Rot. Roll again to see what effect the disease has on that member: 

|D6 |Result|
|:- | :-: |
|1 |Major Symptoms: The plague races through the victim’s system, producing horrible disfiguring lesions before killing him. If the model is a Henchman, he dies. If the model is a Hero, roll D3 times on the Serious Injury table (ignoring Robbed, Bitter Enmity, Captured and Sold to the Pits results) to determine the long term effects of the disease. |
|2~5| Minor Symptoms: The plague takes its toll on the victim as it takes its course. Without proper bed rest the victim will die. The warband member must miss the next game as he recovers. |
|6 |Full Recovery! The victim has an especially hardy constitution or gets an extremely mild case of the disease. The victim suffers no ill effects.|


### 54. Last One Standing

The horrors of Mordheim can drive even the strongest mind past the point of madness. This Sigmarite Matriarch (for stats see the Sisters of Sigmar section of the Mordheim rules) has seen her entire warband cut down around her and the experience has proven too much. She now seeks revenge and is not particular about who has to pay! She is armed with two Sigmarite Warhammers and wears heavy armour and a helmet. She knows the prayers The Hammer of Sigmar and Armour of Righteousness (see the Prayers of Sigmar chart in the Mordheim rules for details). Roll randomly to determine which she casts on herself each turn. She has the skills Mighty Blow and Resilient. The Matriarch will move as quickly as possible towards the nearest model and engage them in close combat if able. If the Matriarch is taken out of action, leave her body where it fell. Any non-animal warband member may loot her body by moving into contact with it during their Movement phase. If this warrior is later taken out of action as well, place a counter where the warrior fell to represent the Matriarch’s equipment. This can then be picked up by a different model, as above. 

```
```
### 55. The Wrong Trousers

Possession? Again? Fortunately the demonic power in question isn't quite as vindictive as others. Rather than posessing a character's arms and attempting to kill them this demon is more of an impish sort of creature. The legs of a randomly determined warband member from the Encountering Player's warband become posessed by this devious entity, and in each of its movement phases it will move 2D6" in a direction determined by the scatter dice instead of its normal move. This movement will ascend and descend walls without the need for a climbing test at no movement penalty, placing models inside the building on a floor closest to their end point should their movement leave them stuck on the outside of a building. This movement ignores all collision with bases, the possessed model moving through allied and enemy bases alike at no penalty, and this movement will cause the character to leave any combat it is in. The character may shoot as normal.



### 56. Catacombs

The ground gives way under one randomly selected warrior from the encountering player's warband and he falls into the depths of the catacombs below the city. He takes a S3 hit from the fall unless he passes an Initiative test, and lands near the remains of others who have fallen before him. Assuming he’s not taken out of action by the fall, he discovers one of the following after a quick search (roll a D6): 

|D6 |Result|
| :- | :-: |
|1| A helmet|
|2 |A small pouch containing 2D6 gold crowns|
|3 |A lantern|
|4 |A net|
|5 |A vial of Black Lotus|
|6| A sword|

Unless he has a rope & hook, the warrior is stuck in the catacombs and cannot rejoin the game. He will count as being out of action for Rout purposes, but will rejoin his warband after the game with no other untoward effects. If he does have a rope & hook, he can climb out D3 turns later, appearing inside a randomly determined building. 

\page

### 61. Forbidden Fruit

Ghostly white flowers suddenly open on a tree in the area and emit a powerful fragrance. Randomly determine a member of the Encountering Player’s warband who happens to be standing next to the tree when it comes to life. Place the tree within 2" of this model. Any warband members within 8" of the tree must make a Leadership test at the start of each of their turns or move as quickly as possible towards the tree. If within 1" of the tree, a spellbound model will pick and eat one of the swollen, blood-red fruit hanging from its branches. Any model eating one of the fruit is automatically taken out of action, as powerful poisons incapacitate him or her. A non-spellbound warband model may keep another model from moving toward the tree by moving into base to base contact with him or her and holding him back. Neither model may do anything else while the spellbound model attempts to move to the tree and the restraining model attempts to prevent him from doing so. Both spellbound and restraining models can react normally if attacked in close combat and a restraining model can give up his attempts at any time. This encounter lasts the remainder of the game. Close inspection of the tree reveals the bones of several animals overgrown with grass and leaves lying at its base. 


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


### 62. The Lost

Many view the destruction of Mordheim as a sign that the world is coming to an end. Groups of these lunatics are often drawn to the city where they attack anyone they come across, certain that they are in some way helping to avert this cataclysm. This group of D3 Flagellants (see the Witch Hunter section of the Mordheim rules for stats and special rules) will move as quickly as possible towards the nearest warband members and engage them in close combat as soon as they are able. They are armed with flails. 

```
```
### 63. Reflecting Pool

One warrior on the ground selected at random from the Encountering Player’s warband notices a small pool of what looks to be still water. Reflecting the gloomy sky above, it appears to be liquid metal or unnaturally deep silvery water, rippling only slightly in the dank breeze which blows through the city. Peering into its depths, roll a D6: 

|D6| Result|
| :- | :-: |
|1| The water reflects back nightmare images of the warrior's own demise, filling them with fear for their own safety. For the rest of the game, no matter how far away they are from friendly models, they will always count as being all alone in close combat.|
|2 |The warrior glimpses an image of what is yet to come. For the rest of the current turn they may re-roll (once!) any shooting or close combat rolls to hit. |
|3| A faint image of the warrior's personal god appears, be it Sigmar or even the dread Shadowlord. Filled with courage, the warrior may ignore any and all Leadership-based tests they are required to make for the rest of the game.|
|4| The warrior peers into the depths of his own mind, unlocking untapped abilities. He can detect any enemy models hidden that turn, even those not in his normal line of sight, and passes the information on to the rest of his compatriots. All enemy models lose their hidden status.|
|5| A slender arm reaches out from the pool, leaving no ripples in the smooth liquid, and pale fingers touch the warrior’s chest. The soft caress causes a faint glow, which spreads throughout his body. Though it quickly dims away, a strong feeling of strength and vitality is left behind. The warrior may ignore the next wounding hit he receives, even if it is a critical hit.
|6| The city chooses to reveal its true visage to the warrior, unveiling the monstrous intelligence that lurks behind the facade of simple ruins and rubble. The warrior’s mind is overwhelmed by the enormity of the impression and he stumbles away in stark terror. For the rest of the game, all enemy models count as causing fear to the warrior and he will refuse to enter any buildings or get within 2" of any walls or ruins. After the game the effects will wear off, though he will always hesitate slightly before entering an unlit room from now on...|
___
_Note: Only warriors who can gain experience will choose to look into the pool, all others simply lack the curiosity to bother!_

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### 64. Screaming Walls

Faces appear in the walls of one randomly determined building and start to emit a piercing shriek. Any warband members within 8" of the building take a S1 hit (no armour saves allowed) and are at -1 on all to hit rolls (close combat and shooting) while the screaming lasts. Spellcasters are even more sensitive to the noise than others and so no spells may be cast from within this radius. Roll a D3 to determine how many game turns the screaming lasts. 

### 65. Wyrdstone Comet

Using the scatter dice, randomise a point 4D6" from the centre of the board and place a counter there. From now on at the start of each of the Encountering Player's turns they must roll a D6. On a 1-3 nothing happens, and marker is placed next to the counter. On a 4-6 a Wyrdstone comet strikes that point! All models within 2D6" of the impact site take a hit at Strength 4, adding +1 Strength for each marker next to the counter. The longer it takes for the comet to land, the stronger the impact will therefore be.

Once the Comet's damage has been resolved, leave the token on the board. Warband members may now retrieve Wyrdstone from the comet in the same way they would collect Wyrdstone in any other scenario. The comet contains a number of Wyrdstone shards equal to its strength when it landed.

### 66. Itsy-Bitsy Spider

The presence of the wyrdstone has mutated this common household pest into a monster of titanic proportions! This Gigantic Spider has the following characteristics:

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Spider |5| 3 |0| 5| 5 |6| 1 |4| 10|
___
**Fearsome Beast:** The Gigantic Spider causes Terror.  
**Gigantic:** The Gigantic Spider is.. Gigantic!    
**Chitinous Hide:** It has an armour save of 4+.    
**Poisonous Bite:**_Any to wound rolls of 5 or 6 (rather than just a 6) are treated as critical hits.

The Gigantic Spider moves from the table edge it starts from to the opposite table edge, attacking any warband members that get in its path and ignoring all terrain features. If it is charged or hit with a shooting attack, it will suddenly turn hostile and behave like a hostile monster from Monster Hunt.

# Power in The Stones
</div>

_“Of course there’s magic in those stones... but it is dark magic, and only the desperate or the foolish would seek to use it. Woe to us that our times are rich in both desperation and fools.” – Fabergus Reinhardt, Witch Hunter_

The value of the wyrdstone shards is not simply the coin that nobles and merchants are willing to pay for them. It is a well- known fact that the stones are rich in magic, and they are said to grant a variety of powers to those that learn to use them. Tales are told among the common folk of stones that caused a certain farmer’s harvest to double, or of the stone that made old Herr Grutenbauer's dog speak like a man. 

True or not, these tales hint at the powerful and chaotic forces at work in the stones. The most common use for the stones’ magic has to do with the discovery of the famed alchemist van Hoffman of Reikland. It was he who first observed that Wyrdstone can serve as a catalyst in the transmutation of base metals into gold. This usage of the stones has come to be the primary obsession of those who seek it, for many are willing to pay princely sums for stones that will make them an even larger fortune. 

Yet there are those who continue to seek the stones for their more arcane uses, and even mercenaries have been known to keep a stone or two that was thought to bring luck, healing, or other magical benefits. Yet the stones are ultimately the work of Chaos, and those who seek to use them often learn to fear their magic rather than harness it. For every tale of a harvest that doubled, there are two about the harvests that rotted in the field when exposed to the strange glow of the stones; and for every tale of a dog that learned to speak like a man there are darker tales of animals that turned into a gruesome parody of a man-beast. 

The tales of magical healings are mixed with many of mutation and death brought on by exposure to the stones. Yet greed is the downfall of many in the City of the Damned, and the greed for power is perhaps the greatest of all... Note: Lawful and Lawful/Neutral warbands are all too aware of the corrupting power of the stones, and will not make use of them under any circumstances. 

## Evaluating Stones

Instead of selling or storing all of a warband's wyrdstone shards, a player may choose to have one or more of their stones evaluated by an alchemist for useful magical properties. This is done during the trading phase of the post- battle sequence. Instead of searching for a rare item, a hero may take one shard of the warband’s wyrdstone to an alchemist. Numerous alchemists have flocked to Mordheim to study the stones, and they ply their trade from tents and wagons in the encampments around the city.

Alchemists are known for their greed, however, and they do not provide their services for  free; for each stone evaluated, the warband must pay 20 gold  crowns and remove the stone from their stockpile as it is consumed in the process. When the stone is evaluated, roll 2D6 on the chart opposite: 
___
**2 - Spell Stone:** Any model who carries this stone into battle may cast one randomly determined spell for the duration of the battle, using the normal rules for spell casting. The spell should be determined at random from the Lesser Magic spell list, and a different spell should be generated before each game in which the stone is used. This means the stone will be more useful in certain battles than others, depending on which spell it happens to provide for that game. 
**3 - Stone of Regeneration:** Any model who caries this stone into battle will regenerate lost wounds at a rate of one Wound regained each recovery phase. A model carrying this stone treats all stunned results it suffers on the Injury Chart as knocked down.  
**4 - Stone of Might:** A model who carries this stone into battle will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected before each battle:

| D6|Result | D6| Result|
|:- | :- | :-: | :- |
|1 |+1 Initiative| 2| +1 Movement|
|3 |+1 Strength |4| +1 Toughness|
|5| +1 Attacks |6| +1 Wounds|
___
**5 - Stone of Warding:** A model who carries this stone will not be affected by hostile magic spells on a D6 roll of 4+.   
**6-8 - No beneficial powers.** 
**9 - Stone of Luck:** A model who carries this stone may re-roll any dice roll they make once per game.    
**10 - Stone of Skill:** A model who carries this stone into battle will have one characteristic increased for the duration of the battle. Roll a D6 to see which characteristic is affected before each battle:

| | |
|:- | :- |
|1~2| +1 Weapon Skill 
|3~4|+1 Ballistic Skill |
|5~6|+1 Leadership|
___
**11 - Stone of Healing:** A model who carries this stone may heal one model within 2" of him (including himself) during each recovery phase. The warrior regains one lost Wound. Note that this healing is only beneficial to models who have more than one Wound on their profile.    
**12 Stone of Protection:** A model who carries this stone has their armour save improved by one point (i.e. a 5+ save becomes a 4+ save). Note that no model may ever have a save better than 1+. If the model has no armour, the stone gives him a 6+ armour save.

### Using Stones

Stones may only be used by heroes. No hero may ever carry more than one stone at a time (the combined Chaotic magic would instantly turn them into Chaos Spawn). Using a wyrdstone’s power is always a dangerous undertaking and to represent this, after every battle, each hero who carried a stone must make a check to see if they have been adversely affected by their usage of the stone’s power.

Make the check by rolling 2D6 for each hero: a roll of 2, 3, 11 or 12 indicates that they have been affected. Skaven, having a natural tolerance for warpstone, are only affected on the roll of 2 or 12. Roll a D6 on the following chart over the page to see what has happened to affected models.   
**1 - Spawn!** The model has succumbed to the raw mutating force of Chaos, and becomes a terrible Chaos Spawn. See 'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.  
**2 - Weakened:** The model has lost some of its life force to the stone. One of the model's characteristics is permanently reduced by one. Roll 2D6 to see which characteristic suffers:

| D6 | Result |
| :- | :- |
|2 |Movement |
|3| Weapon Skill|
|4 |Ballistic Skill |
|5~6| Strength|
|7~8 |Toughness|
|9~10| Initiative|
|11~12| Leadership|

If any characteristic is reduced to 0 as a result of the weakening, the model becomes a Chaos Spawn. See 'Becoming a Chaos Spawn' below.    
**3~4 - Sickened:** Exposure to the stone's magic has made the warrior physically ill. He must miss the next battle while he recovers.  
**5~6 - Mutation!** The corrupting power of Chaos has caused the model to gain a mutation. Roll on the Random Mutation Table (see below).

### Becoming a Chaos Spawn

Chaos Spawn are the wretched remains of one who has tasted the power of Chaos and proved unable to withstand its mutating touch. Wracked with waves of mutation and change, a warrior is reduced to a monstrous beast of fangs, tentacles, eyeballs, and other horrific growths. Their mind is forever shattered, and they become a gibbering and mindless servant of Chaos. Typically, when a being meets this fate, his former comrades will put him out of his misery with a swift death... unless that seems like too dangerous a task to attempt, in which case they will simply herd the beast away down one of Mordheim’s winding alleys or into the sewers. There are, however, some who have a desire for and affinity with Chaos Spawn that allows them to keep their mutated friend among their ranks as a weapon and pet to use against their enemies.

If one of your heroes becomes a Chaos Spawn he is considered to be lost to the warband, unless your warband is from the Cult of the Possessed or Skaven. Followers of Chaos have a sort of semi-reverence for these mindless beasts, and the Skaven have long been adept at training and using the products of wyrdstone-induced mutation. When the hero ‘Spawns’, any armour they were wearing is lost in the storm of violent mutation that overtakes the unfortunate warrior. Weapons and equipment are abandoned by the creature, but may be reclaimed by the warband. The hero is removed from your roster, and you gain a Chaos Spawn henchman. They may never gain experience.

The Spawn will not gain any experience points from future battles; it is far too mindless to learn from its actions. The Spawn should be represented by an appropriate model. While this could be one of the Chaos Spawn models from the Warhammer line, it's probably more satisfying and fun to make your own. Spawn are the ultimate you-can-do-no- wrong conversion project, where you can throw together all sorts of stray bits to make a really unique model. This is doubly true if you can incorporate elements from the character it used to be.

### Random Mutation Table

Mordheim is a city under the sway of Chaos, and with Chaos comes mutation and change. There are numerous ways by which a warrior can be afflicted with mutation, and there are some who actually seek out mutation as a 'reward’ of the Chaos Powers. While mutations are not always harmful, and indeed can often be helpful, they are a mark of Chaos, and as such those who bear them are feared, shunned and persecuted throughout the Empire.

The following is a table used to generate the colourful, exotic, and sometimes debilitating mutations that will be visited upon certain warriors at certain times (as a result of exposure to Wyrdstone, for example). The table uses a D66 roll, just like the Heroes Serious Injuries table. If the mutant rolls a mutation that it already possesses, re-roll it until a new mutation is generated. Note: The great danger of mutation is that it will ultimately overwhelm the victim with the corrupting power of Chaos, reducing them to a monstrous and mindless Chaos Spawn. To represent this danger, if a warrior ever has a characteristic reduced to zero as the result of a mutation, they immediately degenerate into a loathsome Chaos Spawn (see the full rules for Chaos Spawn above).

Warbands that are not at least somewhat Chaotic lack the open- mindedness to tolerate the more visible mutations. Warriors from these warbands that acquire a mutation marked with a * will be immediately removed from the roster.

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

#### Random Mutation Table

Roll a D66  
**11 - Acid Spray:** The mutant can spit acid at its foes. The acid spray uses the mutant’s Ballistic Skill to hit, just as if the mutant were firing a missile weapon. The spray has a range of 8", and a Strength of 4. The mutant does not suffer any penalty for spraying a target at long range, nor does the mutant suffer any penalty for moving and spraying in the same turn.      
**12 - Atrophy:** A part of the mutant’s body has become shrivelled and atrophied. Roll a D6:

+ 1 Head - The mutant is now subject to stupidity.
+ 2-4 Arm - The mutant loses the use of one arm. The
mutant may only use a single one-handed weapon from
now on. If all arms are lost the mutant's maximum Weapon Skill is 
reduced to 0.
+ 5-6 Leg - The mutant loses the usage of one leg. Divide the
mutant's Movement in half, rounding up. If both legs are
lost, the mutant must be retired from the warband.  
___
**13 - Beaked:*** The mutant has a beak like that of a bird or octopus, though its other facial features remain unchanged. Unless the mutant already possesses a bite attack, the mutant may make an additional attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its vicious bite.   
**14 - Beweaponed Extremities:*** The mutant’s hands are turned into weapons! The mutant may no longer use other weapons or equipment that would require the usage of hands. On the plus side, it no longer has to worry about being caught without a weapon! The mutant will gain the normal extra attack in hand-to-hand for using an additional hand weapon, and the weapon extremities follow the normal rules for weapons of their type (i.e. sword extremities may be used to parry).

Roll a D6 for each arm to see what it becomes:
+ 1-2 sword
+ 3-4 mace
+ 5-6 axe.

If the mutant grows two sword extremities, it may re-roll failed parries just as if it had a sword and a buckler.   
**15 - Blackblood:** If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit  from the spurting corrosive blood. 
**16 - Brightly Patterned Skin:*** The mutant's skin becomes brightly coloured with contrasting stripes, spots, or other patterns. No effect on play, but a great excuse to paint an interesting new model! 
**21 - Burning Body:*** The mutant's body is constantly burning with flickering tongues of hellish flame and burns with unnatural light. The warrior may not carry any weapons or armour unless they are magical, or forged from Gromril or Ithilmar. The model may never go into Hiding. Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an automatic Strength 3 hit at the beginning of each close combat phase with the Flaming Attacks special rule.  
**22 - Cloud of Flies:** The mutant is permanently surrounded by a great swirling mass of flies. Opponents in close combat with the mutant are at -1 on all to hit rolls, as the flies buzz into eyes, noses, and mouths.
```
```
**23 - Cloven Hooves:*** The warrior gains +l Movement. 
**24 - Crystalline Body:*** The mutant's body becomes living crystal, which is tough, but easily shattered. The mutant's Toughness becomes 6, while its Wounds become 1. Neither of these attributes can subsequently be altered by experience or mutation. If an experience advance indicates a change in one of these characteristics, re-roll the advance until a different characteristic advance is obtained. They may not ride mounts.    
**25 - Elastic Limbs:*** The mutant's arms can stretch out, allowing the mutant to attack from a distance. If the mutant is not in base contact with an enemy model at the beginning of the hand-to-hand combat phase, it may make one hand-to-hand attack against a single visible enemy within 6" of the mutant. The enemy does not get a chance to fight back.   
**26 - Enormously Fat:** The mutant becomes enormously fat and bloated. Divide its Movement in half, rounding up; add +1 to its Toughness; and reduce its Initiative by 1.  
**31 Extra Arm:*** The mutant may use any single-handed weapon in the extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting in hand-to-hand combat. Alternatively, he may carry a shield or buckler in the extra arm. If a mutant who is unable to use weaponry (i.e. Possessed, Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain an extra attack; they are still not permitted to use weapons. 
**32 - Extremely Thin:** The mutant becomes a matchstick figure, sickly thin and bony. Divide its Toughness in half, rounding up.   
**33 - Eyestalks:** The mutant has stalked eyes, similar to a crab. The mutant now causes fear. 
**34 - Fangs:** The mutant grows huge fangs, giving it an extra bite attack (unless it already has one) in each hand-to-hand combat phase. The bite attack uses the mutant's normal Strength.   
**35 - Furry:** The mutant grows a covering of long, dense fur. The mutation changes the mutant's appearance only; and has no effect on its profile.    
**36 - Great Claw:*** One of the mutant's arms ends in a great, crab-like claw. It may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains an extra attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1 Strength bonus. 
**41 - Hideous:** The mutant causes fear, and is seldom invited to parties. 
**42 - Horns:*** The mutant's head grows horns, and it gains the special rule Impact Hits (1).  
**43 - Iron Hard Skin:*** The mutant's skin is covered in iron and steel scales. The mutant's armour save is improved by +1 (i.e. a 5+ save becomes a 4+). Note that a warrior's armour save may never improve to better than a 1+ save. If the mutant has no armour, their skin alone gives them a 6+ armour save. 
**44 - Mace Tail:** The mutant grows a flexible tail with a mace-like bony tip. Unless it already has a tail, the mutant gains an extra tail attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase at the mutant's Strength +1. If the mutant already has a tail, it will have to decide at the beginning of each hand-to-hand phase which tail it wishes to use.    
**45 - Moronic:** The mutant's mind shrinks. The mutant is now subject to stupidity.
\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

**46 - Plague Bearer:** The mutant carries a hideous, Chaos-tainted disease. The mutant's limbs are covered in open sores, and the mutant is dramatically weakened by its condition. Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1. Any time the mutant hits an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, there is a chance they have infected their foe with this debilitating disease: the enemy model must roll equal to or less than its Toughness on a D6 to avoid contracting the sickness. If the roll is higher than the model's Toughness, they suffer the -1 Toughness for the rest of the battle, (after which it is assumed they get immediate herbal remedies and plenty of rest to keep the disease from setting in permanently!). The Plague Bearer may not infect the same model more than once in a single battle. In addition, the Plague Bearer's ghastly appearance means it now causes fear.   
**51 - Poisonous Bite:** The mutant grows small fangs which can secrete a potent poison. Unless the warrior already has a bite attack, it gains an extra attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase due to its deadly bite. The poisonous bite is a Strength 5 attack, but is reduced to Strength 2 if the target of the bite is immune to poison. If the mutant already possesses a bite attack, it is simply upgraded to include the poisonous effect described above.  
**52 - Prehensile Tail:*** The mutant grows a prehensile tail. Unless the mutant already has a tail attack, it gains an additional attack with this tail in each hand-to-hand combat phase. The mutant may hold and use any singlehanded weapon in the tail, or alternatively, it may carry and use a shield or buckler with it. If a mutant with other tail attacks does use an equipped prehensile tail in a hand-to-hand combat phase, it may not use any of its other tail attacks during that phase; a single tail must be selected for use at the beginning of each hand-to-hand phase. If a mutant unable to use weaponry (i.e. Possessed, Chaos Spawn, etc.) gains this mutation, they simply gain an extra attack (unless they already possess a tail attack); they remain unable to use weapons.  
**53 - Regeneration:** The Mutant gains the Regeneration special rule.  
**54 - Resilient:** The mutant's skin thickens, or becomes scaly, or otherwise increases its resilience to damage. Increase the mutant's Toughness by +1.   
**55 - Scorpion Tail:*** The mutant has a long barbed tail with an envenomed tip, allowing it to make an extra Strength 5 attack in each hand-to-hand combat phase (unless the mutant already has a tail attack, in which case it will have to select a single one of its available tail attacks in each hand-to-hand phase). If the model hit by the tail is immune to poison, the Strength of the hit is reduced to 2.    
**56 - Skull Face:*** The flesh of the mutant's face dissolves, leaving a skull. The mutant now causes fear. They may no longer search for rare items between games.    
**61 - Spines:*** Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each close combat phase.    
**62 - Stunted:** The mutant's body becomes hunchbacked and stiffened. Reduce the mutant's Movement and Initiative by -1.   
**63 - Suckers:*** The mutant's limbs are covered in adhesive suckers. The mutant automatically passes Initiative tests when climbing.  
```
```
**64 - Tentacle:*** One of the mutant's arms ends in a tentacle. It may grapple its opponent in close combat to reduce their attacks by -1, down to a minimum of 1. The mutant may decide which attack its opponent loses.  
**65 - Warts:** The mutant is covered in repellent warts. The mutant's profile is unaffected.   
**66 - Misshapen Wings:*** Be they chitinous scarab wings or the leathery membranes of a bat, the Mutant has sprouted just enough mass to be capable of brief and exhausting flight. The Mutant may now freely move over models, or fly up or down from ledges without needing a climbing test. However, the Mutant's cumbersome and awkward frame was never intended to have wings, so they may no longer run (but may still charge).

# Visiting the Apothecary
</div>

As Warriors accumulate wounds and injuries the need to treat those more complex conditions can become more acute. The basic medical knowledge of field-doctors is essential to keeping Warband members alive, but it is insufficient for treating the more complex maladies that Warriors will inevitably acquire. 

Most warbands will not suffer an invalid among their ranks and will quickly dismiss them (if they're lucky!), but should a warband feel charitable (or more likely, should the injured Warrior be worth preserving) then there are opportunistic, if somewhat insane, doctors who make Mordheim their home.

Each warrior may only attempt to get treatment for one injury at a time, and only one attempt at treatment per Hero may be made during each post battle sequence. Doctors are well aware that their prices will vary based on the value of the person whose life they intend to save, and so will charge gold equal to double the Hero's experience, plus 20 if they are Large. If a Gigantic character requires treatment the cost is an additional 100 gold.

The following injuries use the Surgery table: Leg Wound, Smashed Leg, Chest Wound, Blinded in One Eye, Old Battle Wound, Hand Injury.

The following injuries use the Brain Surgery table: Madness, Nervous Condition

### Surgery table

2D6 Result

##### 2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’

The unfortunate patient has expired due to excessive blood loss. The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the warband record, but their equipment is retained by the warband.

##### 4 ‘This has got to come off!’

The surgeon has felt the need to amputate, ostensibly to ‘keep the rot out’. If a leg was being treated, the model now has its Movement halved (rounding up); if a hand was being treated, the warrior may only use a single-handed weapon from now on. The missing limb cannot be found for some reason.

##### 5-6 ‘Sorry, lad!' Done my best!’

The surgery was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss the next battle while they recover.

##### 7-8 ‘No luck!’

The surgery was unsuccessful.

##### 9-10 ‘Mind you stay off it for a bit!’

The surgery was successful! The warrior may remove the injury and its adverse effects from their profile. They must, however, miss the next battle while they recover.

##### 11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’

The surgery was a complete success! The warrior may remove the injury and its adverse effects from their profile, and does not miss the next battle!

```
```
### Brain Surgery table

2D6 Result

##### 2-3 ‘Someone fetch a priest!’

The physician has been a bit too zealous in his treatment. The Hero is dead and must be stricken from the warband record, but their equipment is retained by the warband.

##### 4-5 ‘Erm... that’s not right!’

The treatment has not only failed to help the warrior, it has actually worsened their condition! The warrior is now subject to Stupidity. If the warrior was being treated for Stupidity, there is no change in their condition (except perhaps, a bit more drooling than usual).

##### 6 ‘A bit unhinged, that one!’

The treatment has failed, and the warrior emerges from the treatment as something of a raving lunatic. The warrior suffers a -1 Initiative penalty (down to a minimum of 1). They are now so unsettling to behold that they cause fear.

##### 7-8 ‘Sorry lad! Done my best!’

The treatment was unsuccessful, and the warrior must miss the next battle while they recover.

##### 9-10 ‘A bit of rest, and you’ll be fine!’

The treatment was successful! The warrior may remove the injury and its adverse effects from his profile. They must, however, miss the next battle while they recover.

##### 11-12 ‘Shallaya be praised!’

The treatment was a complete success! The warrior may remove the injury and its adverse effects from their profile, and does not miss the next battle!

# Hammerheim Mods
</div>

Welcome to the Hammerheim part of the book, and congratulations for making it this far! 

This section is an optional supplement which explains how to convert your Warhammer units into a Mordheim format. The purpose of the Hammerheim integration initially came about because in the original game, once one warband got ahead they inevitably stayed ahead: new warriors started out far too weak to ever compete with high-experience Henchmen or Heroes, and with income being tied to success events quickly snowballed out of control after even just two or three games.

Warhammer units tend to be much more powerful as a baseline, and often much more specialised. This has meant that if a very 'shooty' warband is ahead, you will usually have some unit or magic item that helps you deal with them - or some giant monster unit to save up for when you want to see what happens if you try to park a Stegadon in an alleyway.

This has not been without challenges. Many units from Warhammer are in fact so powerful or so specialised that in some circumstances prove either totally worthless or campaign-endingly powerful, and so this section will also include some balancing changes that our games group has found essential in order for everybody to have a good time.

### Additional resources:

http://broheim.net/warbands.html - Additional Warbands. 
https://warhammerarmiesproject.blogspot.com/ - Beautifully well made army books, and very well balanced. I recommend sticking to the 8th edition segment, as 9th doesn't translate over as well.


## Starting a Campaign

Warbands are initially created as usual. However, equipment bought with your initial 500 gold may not be sold, and any unspent gold is lost when creating your warband. This is to prevent starting gold being spent wholly on Warhammer units, which will end a campaign very early.

After playing your first match you may buy units from a suitably Warhammer army book of your choice (for example, a Greenskin warband would pick from an Orcs & Goblins army book). Models are bought as induviduals and function in the same way as in Mordheim.


## Purchasing additional units

### Unit prices

The gold cost of Warhammer warriors is equal to the points cost listed in their book with the following modifiers:

| |
|:- | :-: |
| Core | x3 |
| Special, Rare | x3.75 |
| Lords, Heroes  | x4.5 |

_E.g. Core Spearman: 7pts x 3 = 21 gold_

```
```
### Warrior starting experience

All Warhammer models except for Lords, Heroes, and unit captains start as Henchmen.

| Unit Type| Starting experience |
| :- | :-: |
| Lord |20 |
| Hero |16 |
| Core Leader | 0 |
| Special leader | 8 |
| Rare leader  |12 |

### Unit limits

Your warband may not consist of more Core characters than it has Special, Rare, Lords, and Heroes combined.

The following modifiers apply: 
- Cavalry count as 2 characters.
- Monstrous Infantry count as 4 characters.
- Monstrous Cavalry count as 5 characters.
- Chariots/war machines count as 1 character plus however many crew and mounts it requires.
- Monsters count as 10 characters.

You will find also that these values match up with the number of warriors these types count as for the purposes of routing, and selling wyrdstone.

### Restrictions & misc.
- No named characters, except via "Favour From a Friend".
- Non-character Monsters do not gain experience, and count as Heroes when rolling for injury. 
- Warhammer characters may only wield equipment they come with and this equipment may not be sold or transferred. Different equipment can be used only if the Weapon Master skill is taken.
- Models that come with a "Hand Weapon" must choose between Sword, Dagger, Mace, or Axe at the time of purchase. 
- Common items (heavy armour, Hand Weapon etc) bought from the Warhammer book may not be transferred or sold.
- All weapons behave according to their section in this Mordheim book, unless explicitly detailed in their own Army Book.
- Models of same type (eg, Infantry) that move into base contact may be considered a unit for the purposes of spells/effects that target units (such as buffing banners, or spells). 
- Magic Items are unique to your warband. If you purchase a magic item and it is subsequently lost, stolen, or destroyed you may not purchase it again.
- Bound Spells that Miscast are immediately destroyed. They may also only be successfully cast once per game.

# Special Rules Modifications

### Challenges
Any combat between Heroes is considered to be a Challenge for the purposes of equipment/skills/items that give bonuses in Challenges.

### Charge Reactions
Charge Reactions are not used, unless an item or effect **Very** explicitly says otherwise (such as Empire's detatchments & regiments, which is their sole reason to exist).
### Chariots
Chariots behave exactly as they do in Warhammer. However once reduced to zero wounds they are immediately removed from play - place any Heroes mounted inside on the ground, Knocked Down.

### Look Out, Sir!
Is not used. Use "Get Down, Mr. President!" if you really want it that badly.
### Musicians & Standard Bearers
Both of these types of character may also start as a Mordheim hero option. Standard Bearers automatically have a Banner item, and Musicians automatically start with the "Musician" skill.

### Skirmishers
Skirmishers may run while shooting, but do not recieve their usual defensive buff against shooting. 

### Slow to Fire
Becomes Move or Fire.

### Supporting Attacks
Similar to Charge Reactions, this rule is never used unless an item or effect **Very** explicitly says so, such as the High Elves' Martial Prowess.
### Swarms
You never need to do an Injury Roll against a Swarm - once they hit 0 wounds they are immediately Out of Action. Swarms however never need to roll for Serious Injuries after the game - they always come back.

### Swiftstride
Has no effect

### Unstable
Has no effect. The Wyrdstone dust and sheer magical concentration of Mordheim is enough to keep even the most incorporeal entity intact.

```
```
### War Machines
War Machines' crews may not leave their warmachine voluntarily. Should an effect such as fear force them to abandon it, they must return as quickly as possible. Treat the War Machine as a single item of equipment shared between the three crew, who must be re-bought if any of them die. Some extrapolation will be required.

_eg. A Mortar has a crew size of 3. Basic Empire State Troopers with a Hand Weapon costs 5 points, therefore it is sensible to assume a crew member with identical stats and equipments costs the same_.

Should all crew die during the same post-game phase then the War Machine is lost. 

In battles the crew function in the same way as in Warhammer, though are treated as independent models for combats. Wounds against the war machine are allocated to the crew.

Cannons and Stone Throwers that hit a building may roll to wound it at Toughness 10. If they successfully wound, the building immediately suffers the Collapsing Building event from Random Happenings (though the building is not removed afterwards).

### Area of Effect Abilities
Some spells or items in Warhammer will state that they effect "all units" within a certain range, dealing a number of hits. These spells will deal one hit on every model within range for each D6 rolled instead of the advertised amount, with each D3 counting as half a D6. Remember that you always round up, so a single D3 hit would still be 1.

Additionally, these spells will only hit enemies within line of sight.

_eg. Cloud of Corruption deals D5 S5 hits on all enemy units within 12". Under the Hammerheim system it will instead deal a single S5 hit on all enemies within 12". Spells that affect all models, friend or foe, are treated in the same way._

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

# Racial house rules

### Orks & Goblins

Units smaller than 5 in size still suffer from Animosity.

### Dwarfs

Longbeards are now Special rather than Core.

### Vampire counts

Players may not summon more than three times the number of models that have been bought for their warband. (eg: If there are three zombies on the roster, no more than nine may be on the table at once). Summoned models must be placed into a unit (base to base). These summoned models are not kept after the game.

Mordheim vampires and necromancers count as vampires/necromancers for the purposes of crumbling and marching etc.

### Tomb Kings

Mordheim liches may be the warband's Heirophant. You will probably have to search online for a Mordheim warband though.

### Ogres

The Ogre Charge special rule grants Ogres Impact Hits (1).

### Warriors of Chaos

When a model with Eye of The Gods puts an enemy hero out of action, roll on the table as normal. If the enemy survives at the end of the game then the Eye of The Gods bonus is lost. If they die then the effect remains permanent. 

Chaos Spawn or Daemon Prince results are always permanent. The warband must remain compliant with the rule about number of core characters in relation to special, rare, heroes, and lords however - if it cannot comply before the start of the following battle then the evolved character will leave the warband. The Chaos Spawn will be uncontrollable, and the Demon Prince will not waste its time with warbands too small to be worthy. 
Chaos Warriors are Special rather than Core.    
Chosen Warriors are Rare rather than Special.   
Buying a Mark of Chaos from a warrior's unit entry behaves in the same way as the Mark of Chaos skills.

### Beastmen

The Infighting Mordheim rule applies to Gors and Ungors from the Warhammer Army Book as well as the Mordheim henchmen.

### Daemons of Chaos

When Horrors successfully generate more Horrors through their lore attribute, the new Horrors must form a unit with the original caster. These Horrors must remain a part of the unit with the original at all times - any who become seperated through initiative/out of actions/random happenings immediately disappear. 

Other spells that generate a D number of Demons will always summon 1 Demon instead, and this Demon may not be retained after the game.

### Hordes of Chaos & End Times

Chaos Warbands that dedicate themselves to only one type of God may choose to be a Hordes of Chaos warband, allowing them to use Beastmen and Daemons in their warbands. 

Ask other players' permission before recruiting End Times units such as Wrathmongers / Blightkings / Stormfiends. These have proven to be **extremely** powerful, though not unbeatable.

### Wood Elves
Trueflight Arrows grant +1 to hit, rather than ignoring all shooting penalties.
