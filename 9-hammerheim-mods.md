## Combining warbands

## Starting a warband

Equipment bought with your initial 500 gold may not be sold, and any unspent gold is lost when creating your warband. After playing your first match you may buy units from a Warhammer army book of your choice, fluff depending. Models are bought as induviduals and function in the same way as in Mordheim.

All Mordheim character starting experience is halved (rounding up).

## Purchasing units

### Unit prices

The cost of units is equal to the points cost with the following modifiers:

| Core | 3 |
| Special, Rare | 3.75 |
| Lords, Heroes  | 4.5 |

_E.g. Spearman: 7pts x 3 = 21 gold_

### Unit starting experience

All models except for Lords, Heroes, and unit captains start as Henchmen.

Starting experience:

| Lord |20 |
| Hero |16 |
| Core Leader | 0 |
| Special leader | 8 |
| Rare leader  |12 |

### Unit limits

Your warband may not consist of more Core characters than it has Special, Rare, Lords, and Heroes combined.

The following modifiers apply: 
- Cavalry count as 2 characters.
- Monstrous Infantry count as 4 characters.
- Monstrous Cavalry count as 5 characters.
- Chariots/war machines count as 1 character plus however many crew and mounts it requires.
- Monsters count as 10 characters.

### Restrictions & misc.
- No named characters, except via "Favour From a Friend".
- Monsters do not gain experience, and count as Heroes when rolling for injury. 
- Characters may only wield equipment they come with and this equipment may not be sold or transferred. Different equipment can be used only if the Weapon Master skill is taken.
- Models that come with a "Hand Weapon" must choose between Sword, Dagger, Mace, or Axe at the time of purchase. 
- Common items (heavy armour, Hand Weapon etc) bought from the Warhammer book may not be transferred or sold.
- All weapons behave according to their section in the Mordheim book, unless explicitly detailed in their own Army Book.
- Models of same type (eg, Infantry) that move into base contact may be considered a unit for the purposes of spells/effects that target units (such as buffing banners, or spells). 
- Magic Items are unique to your warband. If you purchase a magic item and it is subsequently lost, stolen, or destroyed you may not purchase it again.

## Warhammer Magic

Warhammer Wizards function in the same way as Mordheim Wizards except:
- During a player turn Wizards can channel dice equal to their wizard level, succeeding on a 6. These dice remain attached to the wizard and may be spent in order to either attempt to dispell an enemy spell (requires 4+) or to add to their casting roll.
- Channeling dice may only be used by the wizard that generated them, and any dice that are unused by the start of the owning player's following turn are wasted.
- Miscasts are included, and cannot be re-rolled for any reason.
- Spells that automatically target the closest enemy will not target enemies in combat.
- One use only items can only be used once per game.
- Bound Spell items work as usual, though may only successfully cast once per battle. They miscast as if they were normal spells.
- Spells that inflict a certain number of hits to all units in an area will instead deal 1 hit on all models within range for each dice used in the spell: So a spell that does 2D6 S4 hits to all units within 12" will instead do 2 S4 hits to all models within 12".

## House Rules:

- In the Monster Hunt scenario the winning player can forgo their rolls to instead gain a magic item of up to 50pts for lesser creatures, 100pts for greater creatures.
- Only things that roll a normal 'to hit' dice can critical hit.
- Fliers, Cavalry, and Chariots treat any terrain features (buildings, rubble, boardwalks etc) as Dangerous Terrain. Cavalry can use stairs without having to roll.
- Infantry Characters may ride in chariots if they learn the Ride Chariot skill, even if they cannot normally do so.
- Siege Weapons (not magic vortexes or grenades) that score a direct hit on a building may attempt to wound the building on T10. If a successful wound is caused everybody in the building must roll as if suffering the 'Collapsing Building' random happening. The building will not be removed from play however.
- New Common Skill: Magic Item. Character may equip up to 25pts of Magic Items. May be stacked up to 4 times.
- New Common Skill: Ride. A character may take this skill to allow it to purchase+use a mount from its relevent book. The character must be the right species and unit type for the mount (eg, a mount normally only available to Goblin Heroes may not be ridden by an Orc or Troll, or a mount only available to wizards may only be ridden by a wizard), and taking a mount in this way will immediately reclassify the character to a Warhammer Hero for the purposes of increase in cost and requiring a certain amount of Core to support it and its mount (This does not apply to mounts from the Mordheim book). This skill must be taken twice in order to ride Monstrous Mounts, and must be taken three times in order to ride Monsters.
- Melee attacks cannot hit on worse than a 5+.

## Warhammer Special Rules Edits:

- Killing Blow causes critical hits that put heroes out of action to always cause serious injury. Henchmen put out of action by a Killing Blow are automatically killed. You can still use Medical Knowledge as normal.
- Stubborn characters may simply refuse to flee no matter how dire the situation. If a warband routs any Stubborn characters in it may choose take their own induvidual rout checks. If passed they will remain in the game and lose the ability to rout.
- Unbreakable characters will only ever rout voluntarily.
- Sniper allows the shooting model to always choose its target, rather than having to shoot the closest.


## Racial house rules

### Orks & Goblins

Units smaller than 5 in size still suffer from Animosity.

### Dwarfs

Longbeards are now Special rather than Core.

### Vampire counts

Players may not summon more than three times the number of models that have been bought for their warband. (eg: Three zombies on the roster, no more than nine may be on the table at once). Summoned models must be placed into a unit (base to base).

The Mortis Engine is prohibited.

Mordheim vampires and necromancers count as vampires/necromancers for the purposes of crumbling/marching etc.

### Tomb Kings

Mordheim liches may be the warband's heirophant

### Ogres

When a model with the Ogre Charge rule charges, roll 2D6. If the result is 10 or more then the model will perform the Ogre Charge and deal the additional impact hits.

### Warriors of Chaos

When a model with Eye of The Gods puts an enemy hero out of action roll on the table as normal. If the enemy survives at the end of the game then the Eye of The Gods bonus is lost, if they die then the effect remains permanent. Chaos Spawn or Daemon Prince results are always permanent. The warband must remain compliant with the rule about number of core characters in relation to special, rare, heroes, and lords however - if it cannot comply then the evolved character will leave the warband. The Chaos Spawn will be uncontrollable, and the Demon Prince will not waste its time with warbands too small to be worthy of their time.

Chaos Warriors are Special rather than Core.

Chosen Warriors are Rare rather than Special.

### Beastmen

The Infighting Mordheim rule applies to Gors and Ungors from the Warhammer Army Book as well as the Mordheim henchmen. 

Henchmen that move into base-to-base due to failing Infighting tests will fight a round of hand-to-hand combat in the combat phase. 

Even though Henchmen normally do not gain experience, henchmen put out of action due to Infighting will give the killer's group an experience point. 

### Daemons of Chaos

When Horrors successfully generate more Horrors through their lore attribute, the new Horrors must form a unit with the original caster. These Horrors must remain a part of the unit with the original at all times - any who become seperated through initiative/out of actions/random happenings immediately disappear.
