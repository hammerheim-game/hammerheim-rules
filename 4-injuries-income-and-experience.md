### Campaigns

Warbands travel to the City of the Damned from all over the Old World. They come from many races and for many reasons but ultimately they must all face the dangers of the dim alleys and twisting, winding streets of Mordheim. Although it is great fun to fight individual battles, part of the challenge of Mordheim is to build your warband into a force to be reckoned with. A campaign gives your warband the chance to gain experience and new skills, as well as the opportunity to hire extra warriors as its fame and fortune increases.

#### Starting a campaign

To start a campaign you’ll need at least two players, preferably three or more. Players may have more than one warband, but most people prefer to run one at a time, as this allows them to devote more of their attention to painting, modelling and playing with their favourite warband. You can start a campaign as soon as two players have recruited their warbands. New players can join the campaign any time after that. Although the new warbands will be less experienced they will soon learn new skills. Fighting other, more powerful, warbands will allow them to develop more quickly.

#### Playing a campaign game

To start the campaign, the two players select one of the scenarios to fight (see the Scenarios section). At the end of each game the players work out how much experience their warriors have earned and how much wyrdstone the warband has collected before returning to its encampment.

Experience is expressed as Experience points which Heroes and Henchmen groups receive for surviving each game. This is covered later in the Experience section. When a Hero or a group of Henchmen has sufficient Experience points they receive an advance. An advance might improve a warrior’s characteristics profile, adding to his WS, BS, S etc, or he might gain a special skill such as Mighty Blow or Acrobat. After each game the warriors collect wyrdstone. This is recorded on the warband’s roster sheet, and can later be sold for gold, used for trading, etc. You can recruit more warriors or buy new weapons from traders. All this is explained in the Income and Trading sections, later.


#### Post battle sequence

After the battle is over, both players work their way through the following sequence. You do not have to work through it all at once (try to do the first three parts straight after the battle – you may wish to consider further purchases later) but any dice rolls must be seen by both players or a neutral third party.

1. Injuries. Determine the extent of injuries for each warrior who is out of action at the end of the game. See the Serious Injuries section for details.

2. Allocate experience. Heroes and Henchmen groups gain experience for surviving battles. See the Experience section for details.

3. Roll on the Exploration chart. See the Income section for details.

4. Sell Wyrdstone. This can only be done once per post battle sequence.

5. Check available veterans. Roll to see how much Experience worth of veterans is available for hire. You don’t have to commit to hiring any at this point.

6. Make rarity rolls and buy rare items. Make rolls for any rare items you intend to buy and pay for them. These items go into the warband’s stash.

7. Hire new recruits & buy common items. New recruits come equipped with their free dagger and may be bought common items. This is done in any order and may be done several times. Note that newly hired recruits cannot buy rare items. They can, however, be equipped with rare items if there are any in the warband’s stash during the next stage.

8. Reallocate equipment. Swap equipment between models as desired (provided they are eligible to use it).


#### Death of a Warrior

When a warrior is killed (Hero or Henchman) all their weapons and equipment are lost. This is very important, so be clear about it from the start. It is not possible to reallocate a warrior’s weapons or equipment once they are dead.

#### Death of a Leader

If the leader of the warband is slain, the Hero with the next highest Leadership value takes command. They then gains the Leader ability (although they must continue to use their original Skill list). If there is more than one Hero eligible to assume command, the warrior with the most Experience points becomes the leader. If that is also even the player may choose. In the case of Undead warbands, the death of the Vampire means that the warband’s Necromancer must take over. If the warband doesn’t include one it must purchase one in the immediate post-game phase else the spells that hold the restless dead together unravel, and the warband collapses into a pile of bones. You can buy a Vampire after the next game, at which point the Necromancer will step down (whether they want to or not) and lose the Leader skill.


#### Buying new equipment between games

As explained in the Trading section, warriors may purchase new equipment and armaments using the warband’s treasury. Warriors can also swap equipment between themselves. Alternatively, old equipment can be hoarded and re-used at a later date.

Weapons and armor purchased, swapped or taken from storage for your warband must be of an appropriate type for the warrior, as indicated by the warband lists. Record any changes to the warrior’s equipment on the roster sheet.

\page

#### Serious injuries

During a game some warriors will be taken out of action and removed from play. At that time it doesn’t matter whether the warrior is dead, unconscious, injured or just playing dead – in game terms they are no longer capable of fighting in the battle which is all that matters.

When you are playing a campaign it matters a great deal what happens to warriors who are taken out of action! They might recover completely and be ready to fight in the next battle, or they might have sustained injuries. Worst of all they might die, or be so badly injured that they have to retire.

When a Henchman receives a serious injury this is treated differently than if a Hero received one (this is to represent the greater effect that losing a Hero would have on your warband). Working out the extent of a Henchman’s injuries is very simple. You will need to roll on the chart opposite to determine what has happened to your Hero. The chart covers a whole range of injuries and random things that might befall your warrior as they struggle to return to camp. Bear in mind that only Heroes who are taken out of action are obliged to roll on this chart.

##### Henchman with Serious Injuries

Henchmen who are out of action at the end of the battle are removed permanently from the roster sheet on a D6 roll of 1- 2. They have either suffered severe injuries, died of their wounds, or decided to quit the warband. On a roll of 3-6 they can fight in the next battle as normal.

##### Heroes with Serious Injuries

After a battle some of your Heroes may be taken out of action. You will need to determine the extent of their injuries before the next game.

To use the Heroes’ Serious Injuries chart opposite, roll two D6. The first dice roll represents ‘tens’ and the second ‘units’, so that a roll of 1 and 5 is 15, a roll of 3 and 6 is 36, etc. This type of dice roll is referred to as a ‘D66 roll’.

Some events, such as losing in the Pits to a Pit Fighter or being victim to _Killing Blow_ will ask you to roll on the first half of this table. In that case the first dice roll is a D3 rather than a D6, meaning your results will be between 11 and 36.


#### Heroes’ serious injuries chart (roll D66)

##### 11-15 DEAD

The warrior is dead and their body is abandoned in the dark alleys of Mordheim, never to be found again. All the weapons and equipment he carried are lost. Remove them from the warband’s roster.

##### 16-21 MULTIPLE INJURIES

The warrior is not dead but only barely. Roll D3 times on the first half of the table, re-rolling any _Dead_ results.

##### 22 LEG WOUND


The warrior’s leg is broken. He suffers a -1 Movement
characteristic penalty from now on.

##### 23 ARM WOUND

Roll again:

1 = Severe arm wound. The arm must be amputated. The warrior may only use a single one handed weapon from now on. 

2-6 = Light wound. The warrior must miss the next game. 

##### 24 MADNESS

Roll again:

1-3 = The warrior gains the _Stupidity_ special rule.

4-6 = The warrior becomes Paranoid. Paranoid behaves exactly like Animosity from the Forest Goblins Warband section, except that on the result of a 1 on the Animosity table the character will attack the nearest ally regardless of whether they are a Hero or Henchman, and regardless of whether they also have Animosity/Paranoia. This effect stacks with Animosity.

##### 25 SMASHED LEG

Roll again:

1 = The warrior may never run, but they may still charge.

2-6 = The warrior misses the next game.

##### 26 CHEST WOUND

The warrior has been badly wounded in the chest. They recover but are permanently weakened by the injury. Reduce the warrior's Toughness by 1.

##### 31 BLINDED IN ONE EYE

The warrior survives but loses the sight in one eye. A character that loses an eye has their Ballistic Skill reduced by 1. If a Warrior loses all their eyes (usually two, mutation effects may vary this number!) they are removed from your warband as if they had rolled a _dead_ result.

##### 32 OLD BATTLE WOUND

The warrior survives, but their injuries linger. During your deployment phase roll a D6. On a result of a 1 the warrior does not deploy and may not explore after the game.

##### 33 NERVOUS CONDITION

The warrior’s nervous system has been damaged. Their Initiative is permanently reduced by 1.

##### 34 HAND INJURY

The warrior’s hand is badly injured. Their Weapon Skill is permanently reduced by 1.

##### 35 DEEP WOUND

The warrior has suffered a serious wound and must miss the next D3 games while they are recovering. They may do nothing at all while recovering.

##### 36 ROBBED

The warrior manages to escape, but all their weapons, armor and equipment are lost.

##### 41-55 FULL RECOVERY

The warrior has been knocked unconscious, or suffers a light wound from which they make a full recovery.

\page

##### 56 BITTER ENMITY

The warrior makes a full physical recovery, but bears a deep resentment against those they deem responsible. From now on the warrior hates the following: (roll a D6):
+ 1-3 The individual who caused the injury. If it was a Henchman, they hate the enemy leader instead.
+ 4 The leader of the warband that caused the injury.
+ 5 The entire warband of the warrior responsible for the injury.
+ 6 Everyone of the same race as the warrior responsible for the injury (eg, Trolls / Vampires / Humans / Orks).

##### 61 CAPTURED

The warrior regains consciousness and finds themself held captive by the warband that won the scenario. If their own warband won or if there was no winner then the warband that put them out of action captures them. If none of the above apply then re-roll this result. The capturing player may ransom the captive hero back to their owner's warband at a price of their choosing, though the owning player cannot refuse a ransom of less than 20gc. If no ransom occurs the owning player may force the next scenario to be The Rescue as they attempt to retrieve their comrade. Captives may be sold to slavers at a price of D6x5 GC. Undead may kill their captive and gain a new Zombie. The Possessed may sacrifice the prisoner. The leader of the warband will gain +D3 Experience if they do so. Captives who are exchanged or ransomed retain all their weapons, armor and equipment. If the ransom is not met and the captive is sold to slavers/sacrificed etc then the capturing player may keep their equipment. 

##### 62-63 HARDENED

The warrior survives and becomes numb to the horrors of Mordheim. From now on they are _immune to fear_.

##### 64 HORRIBLE SCARS

The warrior causes _fear_ from now on.

##### 65 SOLD TO THE PITS

The warrior wakes up in the infamous fighting pits of Cutthroat’s Haven and must fight against a Pit Fighter. The Pit Fighter has the statline of a Pit King from the Pit Fighter warband and is equipped with two Morningstars. Roll to see which side charges, and fight the battle as normal. If the warrior loses, roll on the first half of this table. If they survive they are ignanimously thrown out of the fighting pits without their armor and weapons and may re-join their warband. If the warrior wins they gains 50 GC, +2 Experience and is free to rejoin their warband with all their weapons and equipment.

##### 66 SURVIVES AGAINST THE ODDS

The warrior survives and rejoins their warband, learning from their ordeal. They gain +1 Experience!
```
```
## Experience

As warriors take part in battles those who survive become more experienced and improve their battle skills. This is represented in campaigns by Experience points. Warriors earn Experience points when they take part in a battle and by completing certain actions, such as defeating foes. Once a warrior has enough points they gain an advance. This takes the form of an increased characteristic or a new skill. Warriors who survive long enough may progress to become great Heroes, with many skills that they have picked up during their long and glorious fighting career. When warriors are recruited, some of them already have some experience. The warband lists detail how many Experience points different warriors begin with. Record these on your warband roster sheet by ticking the right number of boxes. No extra advances are gained for this experience. It simply represents the experience the warriors have accumulated before the warband is formed.

#### Earning experience

The Experience points warriors earn depend on the scenario. Different scenarios have different objectives and consequently warriors can earn experience in a variety of ways. Extra Experience points are always added to the fighter’s total after the game is over, though it is a good idea to keep a record of the opponents your warrior puts out of action during the battle, as this often effects the experience they
gain.

If you look through the scenarios you will notice that warriors always earn +1 Experience point for surviving a battle. They earn this even if they are injured – so long as they live to fight again!

The Scenarios section includes details of how many Experience points are earned for each scenario.

#### Experience advances

As warriors earn more Experience points they are entitled to make Advance rolls. The warband roster sheet shows how much experience a Hero or a Henchman group must accumulate before making a further roll. When the accumulated experience reaches a box that has thick borders, the warrior may make an Advance roll. The roll(s) must be taken immediately after the game in which the advance was earned, while both players are present to witness the result. Note that Henchmen gain experience as a group, and consequently all the warriors in one group gain the same advance.

#### Underdogs

If a warband is deemed to be significantly weaker than the other participating warbands it may be considered an Underdog - though this must be decided unanimously by all players. An Underdog warband will recieve a bonus +1 experience to all participating Heroes and Henchmen Groups. 

\page

#### Advance rolls

Make Advance rolls straight after the battle so both players
can witness the result. Roll 2D6 and consult the appropriate
tables below. In the case of increases to Characteristics the effects are cumulative and permanent.

##### Heroes

2D6 Result

2 - 5: New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the Hero and pick a skill. If they are a wizard they may choose to randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill. See the Magic section.

6: Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Strength; 4-6 = +1 Attack.

7: You may choose between +1 WS or +1 BS.

8: Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Initiative; 4-6 = +1 Leadership.

9: Roll again: 1-3 = +1 Wound; 4-6 = +1 Toughness.

10 - 12 New Skill. Select one of the Skill tables available to the
Hero and pick a skill. If they are a wizard they may choose to
randomly generate a new spell instead of a skill.

##### Henchmen

All warriors in the group gain the same advance.

2D6 Result

2 - 4: The group gains +1 Initiative.

5: The group gains +1 Strength.

6 - 7: Choose either +1 BS or +1 WS.

8: The group gains +1 Attack.

9: The group gains +1 Leadership.

10 - 12 Lad's Got Talent!: One model in the group becomes a Hero. If you already have the maximum number of Heroes, roll again. The new Hero remains the same Henchman type (e.g., a Ghoul stays as a Ghoul) and starts with the same experience the Henchman had, with all their characteristic increases intact. You may choose two skill lists available to Heroes in your warband. These are the skill types your new Hero can choose from when they gain new skills. The new Hero can immediately make one roll on the Heroes Advance table. The remaining members of the Henchmen group, if any, roll again for the advance that they have earned. If there are no Hero slots available in your warband for the new one you may choose to evict an existing Hero to make room, or to return the upstart Henchman to their group.
#### New skills

There are several types of skill and each has a separate list. You may not choose the same skill twice for the same warrior. The skills a Hero may have are restricted by the warband they belong to and what type of Hero they are. To select a new skill for a Hero, pick the type of skill you want from those available, then choose which skill has been learned.

```
```

## Income

At the end of each battle a warband may roll on the Exploration chart. This is done as soon as a game is over so that players can witness each other’s dice rolls. Roll a D6 for each Hero in your warband who survives without going out of action. This represents the warband’s efforts to scour the surrounding areas and unearth wyrdstone. Do not roll for any Heroes who went out of action during the battle; they are taken back to the warband’s encampment to recuperate instead. So, for example, if your warband includes four Heroes who all survived the last battle, you can roll four dice. Warriors who rout but were not taken Out of Action may still search after the game.

If you won your last game, you may roll one extra dice. Add the results of the dice together and consult the Exploration chart to see
how many shards of wyrdstone your warband has found.

Do not roll for Henchmen. This does not mean that they don’t search the ruins, but instead represents the efforts of the Heroes in coordinating the search parties. In addition, some Henchmen like Zombies or Warhounds (for obvious reasons) are not particularly useful when it comes to looking for wyrdstone.

#### Rolling multiples

As well as finding shards of wyrdstone, the warband can come across unusual places or encounter inhabitants of the ruined city. If you roll two or more of the same number while searching, you have found an unusual building or encountered something out of ordinary. Consult the chart and refer to the appropriate entry in the Exploration results.

For example, you might roll two 3’s or three 5’s, in which case you should refer to the chart. 

Any money or loot you find in these locations is added straight to the warband’s treasury. Any shards of wyrdstone you find can be sold as normal.
#### Exploration procedure

1. Roll 1D6 for each of your Heroes who survived the battle and
one extra dice if you won, plus any extra dice allowed by skills
or equipment. Note, however, that you must pick a maximum of
six dice out of all the dice you roll, even if you are allowed to
roll seven dice or more.
2. Some things, such as skills and equipment, (like the
Mordheim Map) may allow you to re-roll dice. If your warband
includes an Elf Ranger, you may modify one dice by +1 or -1.
3. If you rolled any doubles, triples, etc, you have found an
unusual location in Mordheim. Consult the Exploration chart on
the next page to see what you find. Refer to the appropriate entry
on the following pages and follow the instructions given there.
4. Add the results together and consult the chart on the next page
to see how many shards of wyrdstone you have found. Mark
down the amount of wyrdstone on your warband’s roster sheet.

\page

#### Number of Wyrdstone shards found

Dice Result Shards Found

1-5 = 1 shard

6-11 = 2 shards

12-17 = 3 shards

18-23 = 4 shards

24-29 = 5 shards

30-35 = 6 shards

36+ = 7 shards

## Exploration chart

### Doubles

#### (11) Well: 
The public wells, of which there were several in Mordheim, were covered by rooves raised up on pillars and adorned with carvings and fountains. The city was proud of its water system. Unfortunately, like all the other wells, this one is in a parlous state and undoubtedly polluted with wyrdstone. Choose one of your Heroes and roll a D6. If the result is equal to or lower than their Toughness, they find one shard of wyrdstone at the bottom of the well. If they fail, the Hero swallows tainted water and must miss the next game through sickness.

#### (22) Shop: 
The Merchants Guild shop has been thoroughly ransacked.Even so, there are still items scattered around the single, long room, mingled in with the rubble. Some are useful, such as cast iron pots and pans and rolls of fine cloth. All manner of smaller items are lying about – the sort of frippery which no longer has a use in a devastated city with few inhabitants. After a thorough search you find loot worth D6 GC. If you roll a 1 you will also find a Lucky Charm.

#### 33) Corpse:
You find a still-warm corpse. A chipped dagger sticks out of his back. Surprisingly, his possessions have not been looted. To see what you find when you search the corpse, roll a D6:

D6 Result

1-2:  D6 GC

3: Dagger

4: Axe

5: Sword

6: Suit of light armor

#### (44) Straggler:
Your warband encounters one of the survivors of Mordheim, who has lost his sanity along with all his worldly possessions. Skaven warbands can sell the straggler to agents of Clan Eshin (who will use the man for food or slavery) and gain 2D6 GC. Possessed warbands can sacrifice the unfortunate individual for the glory of the Chaos gods. The leader of the warband will gain +1 Experience. Undead warbands can kill the man and gain a Zombie for no cost.

Any other warband can interrogate the man and gain insight into the city. Next time you roll on the Exploration chart, roll one dice more than is usually allowed, and discard any one dice. (For example, if you have three Heroes, roll four dice and pick any three).
 ```
 ```
#### (55) Overturned Cart
Stuck in a ruined gateway is an overturned wagon – the covered type that nobles travel in from the city to their estates in the country. Since anyone important fled a long time ago, what is it doing here? The horses have broken their traces, or did someone cut them free?
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1-2 Mordheim Map (see Miscellaneous Equipment)

3-4 A purse with 2D6 GC

5-6 Jewelled Swords: These are surprisingly fine weapons, clearly belonging to a wealthy noble. They may be used or sold for a combined total of 15GC.

#### (66) Ruined Hovels
The street consists of ruined hovels, which are leaning over at alarming angles. Not much worth looting here. You find loot worth D6 GC amidst the ruins.

### Triples

#### (111) Tavern
The ruin of a tavern is recognisable by its sign still hanging on the wall. The upper part of the building is ruined, but the cellars are cut into rock and are still full of barrels. There are broken flagons and tankards everywhere. 

You could easily sell the barrels for a good price, but unfortunately your warriors are also interested in the contents! The warband’s leader must take a Leadership test. If they pass, the warband gains 4D6 GC through the sale of the barrels.

If they fail, the warband drinks most of the alcohol despite their leader’s threats and curses. You have D6 GC worth of alcohol left when the warband reaches their encampment. Undead, Witch Hunter and Sisters of Sigmar warbands automatically pass this test, as they are not tempted by such worldly things as alcohol.

#### (222) Smithy
The furnace and toppled anvil make it obvious what work was done here. Most of the iron and the tools have been looted long ago. Coal and slag litter the floor but there may still be weapons to be found among the debris. 

Roll a D6 to determine what you find inside:

D6 Result

1 Sword

2 Double-handed weapon

3 Flail

4 D3 Halberds

5 Lance

6 2D6 GC worth of metal (add the value to your
treasury).

\page

#### (333) Prisoners
A muffled sound comes from one of the buildings. Inside you find a group of finely dressed people who have been locked in a cellar. Perhaps they are prisoners taken by cultists, ready to be sacrificed during Geheimnisnacht.

Possessed warbands can sacrifice the victims (undoubtedly finishing the job of the captors). They gain D3 Experience which is distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband. 

Undead warbands can callously kill the prisoners and gain D3 Zombies at no cost. 

Slaver factions may sell the group into slavery for 3D6 GC.

Other warbands can escort the prisoners out of the city. For
their trouble, they are rewarded with 2D6 GC. In addition,
one of the prisoners decides he wishes to join the warband. If
you can afford to equip the new recruit with weapons and
armor, you may add a new Henchman to any of your human
Henchman groups (with the same stats as the rest of the
group, even if they have already accumulated experience).

#### (444) Fletcher
This hovel was once the workshop of a fletcher – a maker of
bows and arrows. There are bundles of yew staves and
willow rods everywhere.

Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1-2 D3 Short bows

3 D3 Bows

4 D3 Long bows

5 Quiver of hunting arrows

6 D3 Crossbows
 
#### (555) Market Hall

The market hall was raised up on pillars, with the timbered
corn exchange above the open market place. The upper
storey has been badly damaged, but the covered market still
offers a good deal of shelter. The remains of the last market
day are still lying around on the cobbles. Most of this is
broken pottery and iron pots.

You find several items worth 2D6 GC in total.
 

#### (666) Favour From a Friend
As you are returning to your encampment you meet a familiar face. Be it a long-lost ally returning a favour or an enigmatic stranger promising to aid you for reasons of their own, in either case your warband finds itself benefitting from their presence for a short time.


You gain the services of a single character from your Warhammer book worth up to 75pts, including named characters. They will join your warband for the next game only before leaving. They will not contribute to your exploration dice, but do not require upkeep either - they are completely free.

```
```
### Four of a kind

#### (1111) Gunsmith

You find the workshop of a Dwarf gunsmith. Its doors have
been broken down and the rooms raided, but some of the iron
strongboxes have survived intact.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1 Blunderbuss

2 Brace of pistols

3 Brace of duelling pistols

4 D3 Handguns

5 D3 Flasks of superior blackpowder

6 Hochland long rifle

#### (2222) Shrine
Your warband stumbles across a ruined shrine, which is so
badly damaged that it is difficult to tell which god was once
worshipped within its walls. A few images remain on the
painted plaster walls but they have clearly been defaced.
Fragments of smashed statues lie among the ruins. Some
items appear to be covered in gold leaf, most of which has
been torn off.

Your warband may strip the shrine and gain 3D6 GC worth
of loot.

Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunter warbands may save some
of the shrine’s holy relics. They will gain 3D6 GC from their
patrons, and a blessing from the gods. One of their weapons
(chosen by the player) will now be blessed and will always
wound any Undead or Possessed model on a to wound roll of
2+.

#### (3333) Townhouse
This three-storey house was once part of a tenement block
overlooking a narrow alleyway. The street is now in ruins,
but this house remains largely intact. Exploring it you find
that the garret leans over so far that you can step out of the
window into the attic of the house opposite.

Your warband finds 3D6 GC worth of loot.

#### (4444) Armorer
A breastplate hanging from a pole drew your attention to this
place, obviously too high up to be easily looted. The
workshop is ruined and the forge has been smashed. Rooting
about in the soot, you find various half-finished items of
armor.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1-2 D3 Shields or bucklers (choose which)

3 D3 Helmets

4 D3 Suits of light armor

5 D3 Suits of heavy armor

6 Suit of Ithilmar armor
 
 \page
 
#### (5555) Graveyard
You find an old graveyard, crammed with sepulchres that are
overgrown with ivy. The monuments to the dead are
grotesque and decorated with sculpted gargoyles. The
ironwork has been ripped from some of the tombs, and stones
have toppled off. It looks as if some of the crypts have
already been broken into by tomb robbers.

Any warband apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar
may loot the crypts and graves and gains D6x10 GC worth of
loot. If you loot the graveyard, the next time you play against
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunters, the entire enemy
warband will hate all the models in your warband. Make a
note of this on your warband roster sheet.

Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar may seal the graves.
They will be rewarded for their piety by D6 Experience
points distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
 
#### (6666) Catacombs
You find an entrance to the catacombs and tunnels below
Mordheim.

You can use the new tunnels you found in the next battle you
play. Position up to four Small warriors anywhere on the table during your deployment phase. They cannot placed within 8" of any enemy models.

This represents the warriors making their way through the
tunnels, infiltrating enemy lines and emerging suddenly from
below ground.

### Five of a kind

#### (11111) Moneylender’s House
A grand mansion, that is strongly built from stone, has
survived the cataclysm remarkably well. A carved coat of
arms adorns the lintel above the doorway although it has
been defaced by raiders and the symbols are now
unrecognisable. The door itself, has been smashed open with
axes and hangs open on its hinges.

Inside, hidden amongst the debris, you find D6x10 GC to add
to your treasury.

#### (22222) Alchemist’s Laboratory
A narrow stairway leads down into a crypt-like dwelling
which was once an alchemist’s workshop. The sign still
hangs from one hinge above the entrance. It looks as if this
was a very old building which has remained in use for
centuries although it did not survive the comet’s destruction
too well. The stone floor has strange symbols on it and there
are charts and astrological symbols painted onto the walls.

There is a wealth of information here, and the warband spreads out to learn what they can - or ascertain just what has any sale value. For every Hero in the warband capable of earning Academic skills you gain 10 GC.

```
```

#### (33333) Jewelsmith
The houses in the jewellers' quarter have all been well and
truly looted long ago. Even the rubble has been picked over
many times for fragments of gold and gems. But still, some
small but valuable items may have been overlooked.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1-2 Quartz stones worth D6x5 GC

3-4 Amethyst worth 20 GC

5 Necklace worth 50 GC

6 A ruby worth D6x15 GC

If your warband does not sell the gems, one of your Heroes
may keep them and displays them proudly. They gain +1 Leadership while wearing the jewels and may discard them once to ignore a Robbed result on serious injury.

#### (44444) Merchant’s House
The merchant’s house stands by the waterfront. It has a
vaulted stone undercroft which is still stacked with barrels
and bales of cloth. The foodstuffs have been looted or eaten
long ago and huge rats infest the rotting bales. Up the stairs
are the dwelling quarters, solidly built of timber, although
badly damaged you think you can still get up to them but
you’ll need to tread with care!

Inside you find several valuable objects which can be sold for
2D6x5 GC. If you roll a double, instead of finding money
you find the symbol of the Order of Freetraders. A Hero in
possession of this gains the Haggle skill.
 
#### (55555) Shattered Building
The comet destroyed this building almost completely, making
it unsafe for all but the most daring to explore. But places
such as this are the best for searching for wyrdstone shards.
You find D3 shards of wyrdstone amongst the ruins. In
addition take a Leadership test against the warband leader’s
Leadership value. If passed they immediately gain the Beast Companion skill and a War Hound companion that was guarding the place. Skaven gain an experience point to a hero of their choice by eating the dog.
 
#### (66666) Entrance to the Catacombs
You find a well-hidden entrance to the dark catacombs which
extend for miles beneath the city of Mordheim. Although the
entrance looks foreboding the tunnels will take hours off your
searches of the city.

You can use these tunnels to explore Mordheim more
efficiently. From now on, you may always add an extra exploration dice to your pool. Finding further entrances will stack this effect, as your warband becomes even more proficient at mapping out the maze-like caverns beneath Mordheim.

### Six of a kind

#### (111111) The Pit
The Pit is the impact site of the meteor when it first struck the city, a vast yawning crevasse that radiates an air of malice. Its depths still smolder after the past few years with the burning green glow of Wyrdstone fire as veins of stone pulsate upwards through the earth. This is the domain of the Shadow Lord, Daemon Prince known as Be'Lakor , and no-one is welcome here - not even his own servants.

If you wish you may send a single Hero into The Pit to attempt to steal as much Wyrdstone as possible. The Hero must take a Terror test and then an Initiative test. If either of these are failed the Hero never returns from their expedition and is removed from your roster.

If the Hero passes both tests they return with arms full of the brightest, greenest Wyrdstone the warband will ever lay eyes upon. These may be sold for 2D6x15 GC.

Heroes with Stupidity or Frenzy automatically fail if sent into The Pit.

#### (222222) Hidden Treasure
In the depths of Mordheim, you come across a hidden chest,
bearing the coat-of-arms of one of the noble families of the
town.

When you open the chest you find the following items. Roll
for every item on the list separately (apart from the gold
crowns) to see whether you have found it. For example, on a
roll of a 4+ you find the magical artefact.

Items D6 Result Needed

5D6x5 GC Auto

Holy relic 5+

Suit of heavy armor 5+

D3 Gems worth 10 GC each 4+

Elven cloak 5+

Holy tome 5+

Magical artefact 4+

#### (333333) Dwarf Smithy
You find a solidly built stone workshop. A runic inscription
indicates that this may have been a Dwarf smithy.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result

1 D3 Double-handed Gromril Axes

2 D3 Suits of heavy armour

3 D3 Gromril Dwarf axes

4 D3 Gromril Hammers

5 D3 Handguns with Heavy Ammunition.

6 Gromril armour
```
```

#### (444444) Slaughtered Warband
You find the remains of an entire warband. Broken bodies lay
scattered among the ruins, torn apart by some monstrous
creature. You see a huge shape, which looks like an immense
Possessed creature, shambling away.

After giving the dead their final rites (Sisters of Sigmar), burning them just to be safe (Witch Hunters), eating them (Skaven or Undead) or looting
them (anyone else!) you find the following items. Roll for
every item separately (apart from the gold coins and daggers)
to see if you find it. For example, on a roll of 4+ you will find
the suits of light armor.
Item D6 Result Needed

3D6x5 GC Auto

D3 Suits of light armor 4+

Suit of heavy armor 5+

D6 Daggers Auto

Mordheim Map 4+

D3 Halberds 5+

D3 Swords 3+

D3 Shields 2+

D3 Bows 4+

D3 Helmets 2+
 
#### (555555) Fighting Arena
During better times, Mordheim was famous for its duellists
and pit fighters. You have found one of the areas used to
train these warriors. The place is filled with training
equipment and practice weapons.

You find a training manual, which you can either sell for 100
GC or let one of your Heroes read. Reading the manual will increase the Hero's WS by 2, and give them the Weapon Master skill - thereby allowing them to wield any weapon they find. 
 
#### (666666) Noble’s Villa
You find a fine house which is partially ruined. It has been
thoroughly ransacked and all the furniture has been stripped
of its fine fabrics. Shards of broken pottery of the finest
quality are scattered over the floor.

Roll a D6. If you roll 1-2, you find D6x10 GC worth of items
and money to add to your treasury. On a roll of 3-4, you find
D6 vials of Crimson Shade. On a roll of 5-6 you find a
hidden magical artefact carefully concealed in a hidden cellar
or behind a secret door. Roll on the Magical Artefacts table.

\page

### Magical artefacts table

Roll a D6 and use this table to determine which item you find when a result in the Exploration chart indicates that you have
found a magical artefact. In a campaign none of these items can appear more than once, so if you find a magic item which is already in someone else’s possession roll again – even if the warrior carrying it has been killed. You do not need to take the Weapon Master skill to wield artefact weapons.

#### 1 The Boots and Rope of Pieter
Pieter, the master thief of the Guild of Shadows, was the most
famous of all the cat burglars of Mordheim. He earned the
nickname ‘Spider’ for his daring robberies. The secret of his
success was a pair of enchanted boots and a magical rope
which he had acquired from far-off Araby.

A model wearing these boots may move normally (including
running, charging, etc) on any kind of terrain, including
vertical surfaces. When moving the model, simply add the
distances moved horizontally to that moved vertically, with
no Initiative tests needed.

#### 2 The Count of Ventimiglia’s Misericordia
This dagger was used by the notorious Tilean gentleman-
pirate known as the ‘Black Corsair’. It is claimed that he
found it in ancient Elven ruins and legend also has it that the
dagger’s blade cannot be damaged in any way.

The dagger is treated as a sword. Opponents wounded by it
are Stunned on a result of 1-3 (Undead are Knocked Down as
normal) and put Out Of Action on a 4-6.

#### 3 Att’la’s World-Treading Mail
This armor was given as a present by the Dwarf Lord
Kurgan to the warlord Att’la in the time of Sigmar
Heldenhammer.

Att’la’s World-Treading Mail is a suit of Light Armour with the
following three runes inscribed on it:

Rune of Spell Eating: The Hero wearing this
armor is immune to all spells.

Rune of Passage: The Hero can move through solid
objects, like walls (this does not however mean that they can
see through them!).

Rune of Fortitude: The Hero has an extra wound.


#### 4 Rambeaux's Banner
Rambeaux was a Brettonian Questing Knight famed for being one of the few Knights to ever turn down their ascension to becoming a Grail Knight. He was an utterly fearless fighter, and uniquely preferred to fight on foot than on horseback with a small group of heroes beyond reproach. Rather than have a squire do it, Rambeaux always carried his own banner in battle - a bold and bloodthirsty red drape enchanted to bring even the slightest spark of heroism into a raging inferno within any who fight under it.

Rambeaux's Banner functions like a normal banner but as long as the wielder is in combat all allied units within 4", including the wielder, gain +1 Strength and +1 Attack.

```
```
#### 5 Executioner’s Hood
Recovered from a shipwrecked Dark Elf vessel, this hood
carries evil glowing runes which fill the wearer with
unreasoning and unfathomable bloodlust.

A warrior wearing this becomes subject to and always will be
frenzied even if knocked down or stunned and adds +2 to their strength. 

The wearer never leaves combat under any circumstances, and will always attack opponents in base contact until they are taken out of action. If the wearer is in contact with multiple enemies they may direct attacks at _incapacitated_ enemies even if there are also standing foes present.

If there are any stunned or knocked down models within the
wearer’s charge range at the beginning of their turn, they will
charge and attack the closest one, even if they are members
of their own warband! Fight the hand-to-hand combat until one
of the warriors is taken out of action.
 
#### 6 All-Seeing Eye of Numas
This jewel was recovered from the ruins of Numas far in the
south. It gives its wielder horrific nightmares that predict their
future, but grants clairvoyance too. It grants the following effects:

The bearer of the All-Seeing Eye can see all models on the
table top, even if they are hidden or out of sight. 

Their incredible foresight and vision also allows them to roll an extra Exploration Dice. 

The bearer gains an additional point to whatever their current Ward Save is. (4+ becomes 3+, no save becomes 6+).

All animals (such as War dogs, horses, etc) will be affected
by frenzy when fighting against the bearer of the All-Seeing
Eye.


#### Selling wyrdstone

Wyrdstone is tremendously valuable and is in constant
demand by Imperial nobles. This means that finding buyers
for your warband’s wyrdstone is not difficult. You do not
have to sell all your wyrdstone immediately after the battle –
you may want to hoard it and sell it later, as selling
wyrdstone in smaller quantities will increase demand and
raise the price. Unfortunately, the demands of running a
warband often mean that you will have to sell most of your
wyrdstone as soon as you find it.

The warband must spend a large portion of its income on
basic necessities such as food, drink, repair of weapons, and
new arrows and ammunition, as well as celebrating! A
warband leader is also expected to share any profits made by
selling wyrdstone between their warband which means that the
more money the warband makes from such sales, the bigger
the share.

The more models there are in the warband, the more it costs
to maintain and the higher the level of any profits made that
must be shared between them. The number indicated on
the following chart is the profit in gold crowns earned after
deducting the warband’s maintenance costs. The profit is
added to warband’s treasury.




\page

#### Selling wyrdstone

In the table below the x-axis represents the size of your warband, and the y-axes represents how many shards you wish to sell. As you can see, the larger the warband size the less gold you will make per shard sold as explained above. A warband of 8 warriors attempting to sell 4 shards would therefore gain 70 gold for the sale, whereas a massive warband of 16 warriors would only gain 55 for the same amount.

| x/y | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10-12 | 13-15 | 16+ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 45 | 40 | 35 | 30 | 30 | 25 |
| 2 | 60 | 55 | 50 | 45 | 40 | 35 |
| 3 | 75 | 70 | 65 | 60 | 55 | 50 |
| 4 | 90 | 80 | 70 | 65 | 60 | 55 |
| 5 | 110 | 100 | 90 | 80 | 70 | 65 |
| 6 | 120 | 110 | 100 | 90 | 80 | 70 |
| 7 | 145 | 130 | 120 | 110 | 100 | 90 |
| 8+ | 155 | 140 | 130 | 120 | 110 | 100 |
#### Sisters of Sigmar and income

Worldly possessions mean little to the Sisters, but their holy
mission to purify Mordheim of the influence of Chaos
requires supplies and weaponry, and these are much in
demand. Thus the warbands of the Sisterhood compete with
each other to gain the best weapons and equipment from the
temple’s armory.

To measure their success, the more wyrdstone the Sisters
bring to be kept under lock and key in the Vault of
Vindication in the temple at Sigmar’s Rock, the more aid
they will receive from the temple.

Thus all gold crowns in the possession of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband represent the resources that the High Matriarch will
put at their disposal. It does not represent money in a literal
sense, so you may like to think of it as faith, piety,
dedication, etc.
#### Skaven and Undead

Neither of these warbands puts much value on gold, but they
send all the wyrdstone they find to their superiors and receive
aid and resources in return. Skaven use their own currency
for trading, while the Undead are somewhat beyond petty
concepts of wealth. For Skaven, the gold crowns in the
warband’s treasury represent the warp tokens which the
Skaven use for currency, while for the Undead it represents
the favour they enjoy in the eyes of their master, Vlad von
Carstein of Sylvania.

#### Spending income

You can spend any accumulated money on weapons, armor,
hiring new warriors, buying new equipment or simply save
the money for a bigger purchase. See the Trading section for
details.

```
```
### Trading

Every Settlement around the city of Mordheim has at least
one trading post, shop or merchant’s guildhouse where the
local traders sell their wares and buy wyrdstone and other
items that have been scavenged from the ruins. In a large
village such a place might cover a substantial area with many
traders and merchants offering their goods and services.
Small settlements are served by travelling traders.
All warbands are able to get new equipment one way or
another. The most unscrupulous merchants actively trade
with the Possessed Cultists, and creatures such as the Skaven
have their own network of contacts, while Vampires can send
the Dregs that serve them into the less salubrious settlements
around Mordheim, such as Cutthroats’ Haven.

#### Spending cash

After every game, a warband can collect income from
exploration, etc, and sell any wyrdstone and treasures they
have acquired. Cash can be spent on recruiting new warriors,
or on new equipment for the warband.

#### New recruits

New warriors are recruited in the same way as the original
warband with the notable exception of equipment. After the
start of a campaign, a new hireling can only buy Common
items from his warband’s equipment chart freely. They may
only be given Rare items from their warband’s equipment chart
if the warband can obtain them via the normal trading rules.
Warbands may recruit whatever type of warriors the player
wishes, but the usual restrictions apply regarding the number
of Heroes, Henchmen, wizards, etc. For example, no warband
may recruit a second leader, and no Mercenary warband can
have more than three Champions.


#### New recruits and existing henchmen groups

You may add new recruits to existing Henchman groups. If
the group is relatively inexperienced, you will have no
difficulty in finding raw recruits to add to their numbers. But
more experienced gnarled veterans are not so keen on letting
novice warriors join them – and quite rightly so! Between
each battle, roll 2D6: this represents the experience of the
warriors currently available for hire. You can hire as many
warriors as you wish, as long as their combined Experience
does not exceed your dice roll. For example, if you rolled 7,
you could add a single warrior to a Henchman group with 7
Experience points, or two warriors to a Henchman group with
3 Experience points, or any combination thereof. Disregard
any excess Experience points.

As with other new Henchmen, you must pay for all their
weapons and armor. New Henchmen must be armed and
equipped in the same way as existing members of the group.

\page
#### Weapons

If a player wants to buy new weapons or other equipment for
existing warriors, refer to the Price chart at the end of the Equipment chapter. The chart lists all the equipment available in Mordheim, not just the common weapons included in the Recruitment charts.
Rare items and weapons are not always available and vary in
price. Remember that your warriors lack the skill to use any
weapons other than the ones listed in the Recruitment charts.
You may still want to buy rare items offered to you, as your
warriors may be able to use them as they gain in experience.
Players should preferably complete any recruiting and trading
after the battle is over, making the appropriate dice rolls
whilst both players are present.

However, some players may prefer to wait until the heat of
battle has cooled and they are able to consider purchases
more carefully. Determine which rare items are offered for
sale while both players are together. The players can work
out what they will buy later.

#### Trading

Trade items are divided into two sections: common and rare
items. Common items can be bought quite readily in any of
the numerous trading posts and settlements around
Mordheim. Players may purchase as many of these items as
they want. The price of common items is fixed, so players
always pay the same rate for them.

Rare items are hard or even impossible to come by. Only
occasionally do such items turn up for sale and the price
asked is often way above the true value. These items are
often offered only to the most famous warbands, or those
with the most money.

#### Availability

The Price chart has a column marked ‘Availability’. Common
items are always available, and can be bought in any
quantity. Items marked ‘rare’ are more difficult to find. A
rare item’s availability is indicated by a number, for example
‘Rare 9’.

Whenever a Hero wants to buy a rare item, roll 2D6 and
compare the result to the number stated. If the roll is equal or
greater, the item is available. For example, you need to roll 9
or more to acquire an item marked ‘Rare 9’. You can only
buy one rare item for each successful roll. You may also only
make one roll for each Hero looking for rare items. For
example, if your warband has four Heroes, you may make
four rolls to locate rare items. Warriors taken out of action
during the last battle may not look for rare items.

```
```
#### Selling

A player may trade in weapons and equipment at the same
time they buy new ones. After all, as warbands become more
powerful they often abandon their earlier armaments in favour
of something better. However, the second-hand value of
equipment is not high due to the considerable wear and tear
inflicted on it by your warriors.

Warriors can automatically sell equipment for half its listed
price. In the case of rare equipment and weapons which have
a variable price, the warband receives half of the basic cost
only (merchants are far better at haggling than your warriors).

Alternatively, weapons, armor and equipment may be
hoarded for future use (make a note on the warband roster) or
swapped around the warband from one fighter to another
(though not between warbands). As a weapon’s value is low
compared to the cost of equipping any new recruits you may
get, a warband can usually find a use for its cast-off
armaments.
