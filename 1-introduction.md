# Introduction
Welcome to Mordheim, City of the Damned! Set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles universe, this game covers the brief period in history a few hundred years before the events that lead up to the aptly named End Times. 

The Empire was a place torn: it had been in civil war for years – there was no Emperor sitting on the throne, and various powers were vying for control. In the Imperial year 1999, a great comet was sighted in the sky – a twin tailed comet, the sign of the one who had elevated mankind from a continent of small disorganized tribes into the vast kingdom it is today: Sigmar, The First Emperor of Mankind.


Astronomers predicted that it would fall in the city of Mordheim, where his convent of Sisters stood. It was believed that it would herald the return of Sigmar, and he would restore the land to its former glory and usher in a new golden age.


Vast multitudes traveled to Mordheim, filling the city well beyond its capacity. Such were the times that lawlessness soon grew out of control.


The citizens of Mordheim quickly degenerated to moral debauchery, giving themselves over to their own worldly temptations, living in an increasing state of anarchy. As time drew closer to the comet's arrival, more and more people made the journey to Mordheim, and the situation became unbearably worse.


The people gave in to acts of depravity and demons walked the streets like men, the seeds of Chaos and corruption long since having claimed the souls of the pitiful thousands who now called Mordheim their own.


The comet fell on the first day of the new era, but it was not to be the coming of Sigmar as predicted. It smashed into the city in a cataclysmic event, annihilating the formerly grand and opulent metropolis and instantly killing the overwhelming majority of its inhabitants. Word got out that Sigmar had passed his judgment, that he had smote those who he deemed unworthy.


The once-affluent city of Mordheim became a place of fear and paranoia. Soon after, word spread of mysterious stones that lay scattered about the city, known as Wyrdstone, which had all manner of reputed qualities.


It was discovered that factions across the Old World would pay incredible amounts for this precious stone, whatever their motivation. And so Warbands began traveling in droves to Mordheim, now dubbed The City of the Damned, hoping to find this precious stone and make their quick fortunes...

## Hammerheim

Mordheim was initially released by Games Workshop in 1999 (you can see where the inspiration for the comet's landing date came from!) as a small-scale skirmish game to offer players a more grounded look at the lives of the people within their Warhammer universe. 

Support for the game ended in 2004, likely as a result of poor sales performance, and yet the game in the past few years has enjoyed a cult resurgence. Games like Mordheim, City of The Damned on the PC have performed well enough to earn sequels, and several fan sites are still regularly updated and maintained by former players.

Many of these sites have attempted to create new rulesets or to remove existing systems to iron out the litany of faults that the original book had: spelling errors, unclear rules, poorly thought out items, and atrocious game balance probably all contributed to the decline of the game - but at its core the concept of a small warband of Heroes and Henchmen evolving and growing, surviving and dying, in pursuit of wealth is a very engaging fantasy.

Hammerheim is our attempt at creating our own ruleset. Much of what you will read here will be very familiar if you played the original Mordheim game, and the book is designed to distinguish between the Mordheim base game with the race/item/rules updates and the Hammerheim expansions that are suitable for longer campaigns. These will allow you to use Warhammer army books that were made redundant by The End Times, and due to the inherant power of Warhammer units you will easily see how they can compete even with highly advanced Mordheim characters. It is entirely possible however to play without these Hammerheim modifications.

_Many thanks to Max CC for introducing me to Github, for doing the backbreaking work of getting all of the Mordheim base rules onto a Markdown format for editing, to bounce ideas back and forth with, and for being the catalyst that set this whole project in motion. Without him this book would never have happened._
