#### Scenarios

##### Scenario: Defend the Hoard

In this scenario the defending warband has prepared to send an accumulation of Wyrdstone back to their masters. Whether it be for sale in the case of Mercenaries, some bribe to win further favours for Skaven, for returning to the chapel for cleansing in the case of the Sisters of Sigmar~ Warbands will have any number of reasons to need to send resources out of the city to further their goals. The defending warband has spent a great deal of time pooling its resources and gathering wyrdstone to send away for sale, but this movement has attracted unwanted attention. Attacking warbands see an unmissable opportunity here, and must attempt to steal as much wealth as possible before the caravan (and more importantly its reinforcements) arrive.
Terrain
The defending player sets up a Hoard of their own design: They may choose four buildings and up to four walkways with which to build a defensible combination of structures in the middle of the table (or at least as much so is possible). In the middle of this superstructure is the Horde, a vast mountain of wyrdstone ready to be shipped as cargo. The Horde contains D3+1 shards of wyrdstone for each player participating in the scenario, and attacking players may collect a shard of wyrdstone from the Horde in the same way they would gather a normal shard of wyrdstone - collecting one per turn. As usual, animals may not gather wyrdstone. Defenders may not steal their own wyrdstone.
Warbands
The defending player sets up first, then attackers roll a D6 to determine who gets to deploy first, and deploy within 6" of their deployment zone. The defending warband may not form any formal alliances for this battle, and no special deployment rules may be used by any warband.
Starting the game
Attacking warbands roll a D6 and play then proceeds clockwise. The defending player always goes last (and therefore always gets the last play of the game)
Ending the game
The game lasts for 8 turns. If the defending player still has at least one warrior within the Hoard at the end of the 8th turn they then win and claim all the Wyrdstone remaining. If the defending player has no warriors remaining at the end of the game then the attackers win. Attackers may only keep the Wyrdstone they had in their possession at the end of the game - unclaimed Wyrdstone left in the Horde or on the ground will be taken by the caravan the defenders were attempting to sell to (though they will of course recieve no credit, as it was no longer theirs to sell!). If there is only one attacker left before the eighth turn they may continue to play alone until the turn limit is reached to steal as much Wyrdstone as their warband can manage!
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 extra Experience.
+1 Brilliant Defence. If the defending warband won their leader may gain an additional +1 extra Experience as the caravan owners marvel at their fantastic defiance of the odds.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.



##### Scenario: Wyrdstone hunt

Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of
priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon
the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the
spoils.
In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while
scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or
other such potentially rich building.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone
counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are.
There will be D3+1 counters in total.
Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to
see which player goes first. The counters must be placed
more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away
from each other. Note that counters are placed before
deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a
good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table.
Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into
contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table
where he fell.
Warbands
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever
rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of his
choice. His opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite
edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the
first turn.
Ending the game
He game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The
routers automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Your warriors earn one shard of wyrdstone for each counter
still in their possession at the end of the battle.

##### Scenario: Breakthrough

When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating,
warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However,
their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone
for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever scores higher decides
which table edge the attacker sets up on.
The attacker sets up first, within 8" of his table edge. The
defender sets up anywhere on the table as long as all his
warriors are at least 14" away from any attacker.
Starting the game
The attacker has the first turn.
Ending the game
If one of the warbands fails a Rout test, the game ends
immediately and the routing warband loses.
If the attacker manages to move two or more standing
warriors to within 2" of the defender’s table edge, they have
broken through and he wins the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Breaking Through. Any warrior earns +1 Experience for
breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman,
then the whole group gains +1 Experience.



##### Scenario: Street fight

Often two warbands will come face to face with each other in the
narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other
without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed.
Terrain
Set up all the buildings into a single street, with no gaps
along the sides. Behind the buildings are impassable ruins,
although the buildings themselves are still accessible. The
only way out is along the street. The street may be as winding
as you like and should not be too narrow to fight in, but can
have narrow bottlenecks at some points. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 to see who sets up first. Whoever rolls
highest chooses whether to deploy first or second. The
warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.
Special rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the
battlefield via their own edge.
Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands manages to move all its remaining
warriors out of the street via the opposing edge, the game
ends and that player is victorious.
Alternatively a warband which fails a Rout test loses the
game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Escaping. The first Hero from either side (not both!) who
exits via the opposing table edge gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Chance encounter

Both warbands have completed their daily search of the ruins and
are on their way back to their encampment when they run into each
other. Neither side was expecting a fight, and the warband that
reacts the quickest has the advantage.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
1. Each player rolls a D6. The player with the higher score
can choose to deploy first or second.
2. The first player to deploy sets up his entire warband in one
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the first
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone A.
3. The second warband can then be set up in the opposite
quarter of the table. The quarter of the table which the second
warband deploy in is nominated as deployment zone B, but
no model may be set up within 14" of any enemy model.
    Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative of their
leader. The player with the higher score goes first.
    Special rules
Each warband is carrying D3 shards of wyrdstone at the
beginning of the battle. Mark down the number each warband
has.
    Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The
routing warband loses.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle then they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
    Wyrdstone
Both warbands gain all the wyrdstone they were carrying at
the beginning of the battle, minus the number of their own
Heroes that were taken out of action during the game, down
to a minimum of zero. In addition, they gain one extra shard
of wyrdstone for each enemy Hero they take out of action, up
to the maximum number of shards the opposing warband was
carrying at the beginning of the battle.


##### Scenario: Hidden treasure

There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed
cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have
heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows
what they will find?
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. His opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.
Special rules
All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know
roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the
buildings to find the treasure. Each time a warrior enters a
building which has not been previously searched by either
side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, he has found the treasure.
Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since
they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each
building may only be searched once.
If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only
one building left to search, the treasure will automatically be
found there. After finding the treasure chest, the warrior must
then take it to safety via his own table edge. Carrying the
treasure chest will slow the warrior carrying it to half speed.
Two or more models may carry the chest without any
penalty. You may use the treasure chest model to represent
the chest. If the carrier is put out of action, place the treasure
chest at the spot where he fell. Any man-sized model may
pick it up by moving into base contact with it.
Whoever recovers the chest may roll on the following chart
after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you
roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns,
which are always automatically found. For example, roll to
see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then
roll to see if you find the armor, and so on. This can make
the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also
mean that your warband has risked death for only three gold
crowns!

ITEMS D6 ROLL REQUIRED
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 pieces of wyrdstone 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Sword 3+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Starting the game
Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.
Ending the game
When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband
fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then
gains the treasure chest.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 For Finding the Chest. If a Hero finds the treasure chest
he earns +2 Experience.


##### Scenario: Occupy

This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings
are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and
holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich
pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
Warbands
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. The first player chooses
the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all his
warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within 8"
of the opposite edge.
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn.
Special rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the
tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest
to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the
next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of
your standing models is inside and no enemy models are
inside the building.
Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests – as the game lasts for
a maximum of eight turns. If one warband voluntarily routs,
the game ends and the winning warband is considered to
occupy all of the buildings on the table.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives they
gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the warband who controls
the highest number of buildings at the end of the battle gains
+1 Experience.
If both sides occupy the same number of buildings, then the
battle is considered to be a draw and neither leader gains this
bonus.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.



##### Scenario: The Rescue

By Pete Rejowski
There are times when your most experienced Heroes are slain, and
you mourn them greatly; however, it is often worse for them to be
captured by the enemy, as not only will it be likely that you cannot
get them back, but your enemy will also greatly profit from it. As the
basic number of scenarios in the Mordheim rulebook does not
include a Rescue mission, negotiations are the only way to go, and,
to put it simply, there are too many reasons for negotiations to fail
(the leader wants to sacrifice the Hero and gain experience, too
much money to pay for the equipment, the player doesn't ever want
to fight that Hero again, etc). This scenario addresses that flaw and
allows a warband to attempt to regain their lost companion.
If such a situation arises, the warband that had a Hero captured
may opt to play the next scenario as a Rescue Mission; this cannot
be superseded by anything, nor can the warband who captured the
Hero deny the Rescue Mission. But if the mission is failed, the
attacking warband cannot play another Rescue Mission immediately
after, even if the option to choose the scenario comes up in the game
after (or even if he had a different Hero captured!). A warband with
the Mordheim map that allows it to “automatically choose the next
scenario” may instead choose the scenario played after the Rescue
Mission (that is, an attempted rescue does not ruin the potential
gain of the Mordheim map for either player).
Notes: This scenario plays like a combination of Defend the
Find and Surprise Attack combined with the Rescue Mission
from Necromunda. It borrows certain elements from the
Necromunda scenario (namely the movement of the sentries,
as seen below), but plays out a bit differently due to the
altered spotting rules and the lack of loud firearms. Those
who have access to the Necromunda version can easily draw
comparisons between the two, but a few things have changed
to keep it more in line with standard Mordheim scenarios.
Terrain
Each player takes a turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. It is suggested
that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The
first building should be placed in the centre of the table, as
the objective of the scenario (the captured Hero and his gear)
will be placed within.
Set-up
The prisoner and his gear are set up in the central building as
described above. The prisoner may not act until he is freed.
The defender is not allowed to attack or “execute” his
prisoner, but must attempt to drive off the rescuers. Once the
captive is freed, however, he is fair game.
A prisoner is free to move and fight once cut free by a
friendly fighter. The friend moves into base contact with him
and spends the rest of the turn cutting him free; he may not
shoot, cast spells, and fight in hand-to-hand or anything else
at all. Once freed, the prisoner may move and attack
normally. Note that the captive has no weapons or other
equipment until he reclaims his own (or if the friendly fighter
gives him something).
The attacking warband can reclaim the captive's gear by
moving into base contact with the chest. As above, it takes an
entire turn to open the chest. If the model who opens the
chest later comes in contact with the prisoner, he may give
him all of his old gear; however, the prisoner may not put on
any armor, as a quick escape is desired (he may use a shield
as normal).

Warbands
The warband that captured the Hero is automatically the
defender, and sets up his warband as follows:
1) The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and
Henchman group in his warband in any order that he chooses.
On a 1-3, they are elsewhere (patrolling a wider perimeter),
and may turn up if the alarm is sounded (as detailed below).
On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the game. Note that
at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be present at the
start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen group will
automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.
2) The defender deploys his available troops on the table. No
model may be closer than 6” to another model, as the
warband is spread out to keep a careful lookout. No model
may be deployed closer than 8” to a table edge. The defender
also places the captured model anywhere in the center
building, and also places a treasure chest (representing his
gear) in the same building. Note that the defender cannot use
any special set-up rules, such as Infiltration.
3) The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8” of a
random table edge, as shown in the diagram for the Surprise
Attack scenario. He may choose which edge to nominate as
“1” before rolling to see where he deploys. The attacker can
use special set-up rules (such as Infiltration) as normal.
However, the attacker cannot use any mounted figures in this
battle, as they are far too noisy; the mounts will be left at
their encampment.
Starting the game
The attacker always gets the first turn.
Special rules
Sentries: Until the alarm is sounded (see below), the
defender's models are moving about in a somewhat random
pattern, keeping a look out. Each sentry moves d6-3 inches
per turn; roll separately for each model. If the distance is
negative, then the attacking player is allowed to move that
model. After moving each sentry, roll the Scatter dice and
turn the model to face the direction indicated. Models with
Stupidity move like this until the alarm is sounded
(effectively ignoring their Stupidity for now).
Sounding the alarm: Until the alarm is sounded, sentries
move as described above. In addition, their Weapon Skill is
halved (rounding fractions up), and they may not shoot or
cast spells. After the alarm is sounded, the sentries may move
and attack freely. In addition, the defender may be able to
bring on reinforcements as described below. The alarm can
be sounded in a number of ways:
Spotting: Roll 2d6 at the end of the defender's turn; this, plus
an individual model's detection range (the range used to
detect Hidden models; usually their Initiative value), is the
distance at which a model can try to spot the enemy. They
must be within the front 90° arc of the model. This represents
that the swirling fog and lingering smoke that fills Mordheim
is somewhat distracting when an enemy does not clearly
present itself; as well, it shows that the attacker is attempting
to move more stealthily than normal.
Attackers in the open will be spotted on a d6 roll of 2+.
Attackers in cover will be spotted on a d6 roll of 4+.

Attackers out of sight of a sentry and not in their frontal arc,
but within the detection range of the sentry will be “spotted”
(more like heard) on a roll of 6.
Sentries will spot any attacker within their detection range
and their front arc on a 4+, whether the attacker is visible or
not; if such an attacker is visible at all (including if in cover),
this chance increases to a 2+.
Raiders are also spotted if they move within sight of a sentry
during their own turn. The spotting range is as rolled in the
defender's turn, and the same dice rolls are required.
Remember, sentries can only see within their frontal arc until
the alarm is sounded.
If a sentry spots a raider, he sounds the alarm. However, he
can only give the alarm if he survives the attacker's turn. If he
is taken Out of Action, then he cannot sound the alarm.
Shooting: If an attacker shoots a black powder weapon, roll
d6 and add the weapon's Strength to the score. If the result is
over 8, the alarm is sounded. Note that firing a black powder
weapon can sound the alarm even if there are no sentries left.
Fighting: A sentry who is attacked in hand-to-hand combat
will sound the alarm if he survives the turn (even if Knocked
Down or Stunned). Remember that the sentry's Weapon skill
is halved until the alarm is sounded. If the raider shoots a
black powder weapon in hand-to-hand, then you must roll as
described above to see whether the shots sound the alarm
even if the enemy is killed.
In addition, the noise of fighting may cause the alarm to be
sounded even if the sentry doesn't survive to do so himself.
The attacker rolls a d6; if the score is not more than the
number of attackers fighting in the hand-to-hand combat,
then the noise of the scuffle has been noticed and the alarm is
sounded. For example, if three attackers slaughter a single
sentry, then you must roll 4 or more on the d6 for this to go
unnoticed.

Reinforcements
Once the alarm has been sounded, the defender may attempt
to bring on the rest of his warband. For each Hero or
Henchmen group not on the table, roll a d6, and on a 4+, they
move on in the movement phase from a random table edge as
shown in the diagram for Surprise Attack. All reinforcements
for that turn arrive from the same edge and may charge on the
turn in which they arrive.
Ending the game
The game ends if the captive is freed and makes his escape
by moving off any table edge. The game also ends if all the
attackers are taken Out of Action. Due to the high tension and
stress of the situation, neither warband is forced to take Rout
Tests until they have lost half of their warband (instead of the
usual 25%).
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 per enemy Out of Action. A hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts Out of Action.
+1 Escapes. The captured model gains +1 Experience if he
successfully exits the board.
+1 Winning Leader (Attacker). The leader of the attacking
warband gains +1 Experience if victorious.
+2 Winning Leader (Defender). The leader of the defending
warband gains +2 Experience if victorious.
Finial Notes
Note that even if a Rescue Mission is failed, the attacker can
still attempt to negotiate for the release of his Hero. However,
given the fact that he just attacked the rival warband, this will
undoubtedly drive up the price! Of course, it is quite possible
that the attacker could have Captured one of the defender's
models, making a trade viable; also, the attacker will likely
have a bit more money to offer, as he gets a second game
worth of exploration (assuming any of his Heroes survived).


##### Scenario: Race to the Stash

By Jace Proctor
In the aftermath of the comet's fall, Mordheim has become a
labyrinth of ruined buildings, decaying streets, abandoned
catacombs, and treacherous alleyways. Some even say that the city
itself is alive, and has the power to reorder its chaotic innards in
order to confuse or destroy the imposing warbands who plunder the
city for precious wyrdstone. It is not uncommon for a warband to
find a safe haven or a stash of treasure only to find it completely
vanished the next day, replaced by a completely different structure.
It is for this reason that warbands will often assail a place of worth
as quickly as possible, to ensure that they can plunder its riches
before it is never seen again. Sometimes two or more warbands will
hear of the same location at the same time, and in these situations a
deadly race can ensue through the streets of Mordheim, with the
victor claiming lordship over the area and defending it from any
attackers.
Through your network of informants and spies, you have learned of
a large stash of treasure deep within the city's rich quarter, which
once housed the affluent and often corrupt upper class of citizens.
According to your informant, this find has only just been discovered,
and the riches are ripe for the taking! Finds like this are rare, but a
find in the rich quarter is almost unheard of, as this area of the city
is trafficked often by the warbands seeking wyrdstone and riches.
Immediately gathering your warriors and gear, you quickly embark
towards the location of the rumoured find. As you quietly make your
way across the remaining bridge and through the streets of
Mordheim, you catch sight of an opposing warband who is
travelling in the same direction as you. A row of ruined, but still
standing buildings separate you from your rivals, who have also
spotted you. The both of you quicken your pace, and suddenly you
hear the crack of a crossbow bolt whizzing through the air and
striking a wall behind you. Your warband returns fire in kind, still
racing through the mottled, uneven streets of the former rich
quarter. Through the gaps in the buildings you exchange shots,
speeding through the twists and turns of the city, approaching the
stash of treasure at breakneck speed. Whoever is to reach the horde
first will have a marked advantage, as they will be able to take
covered positions and defend the find against the attackers.
This Scenario can be used for both Two Player and
Multiplayer Games.
Terrain
Set up the terrain so that there are two lanes or streets, one for
each warband, with both lanes eventually leading to a
building or other structure that represents the treasure horde.
The lanes should be segregated by a row of buildings or other
such terrain that is impassable on foot, but can be shot
through. These lanes should be as similar as possible with
respect to length and distance from the goal, but do not have
to be perfectly straight or symmetrical. A slightly longer table
or playing area than normal is recommended for this
scenario; something roughly 5' x 2' or larger would do nicely.
Set-up
Roll a D6 for each player. The player with the highest score
can choose which lane he or she wants to set up in. The
opposing player must set up in the other lane. All models
must be deployed within 6” of the closest table edge and
inside the lanes. Because the warbands are racing toward the
goal as fast as possible, no models may be deployed on high
ground at the start of the game. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative value of
their leader. The player with the highest total result goes first.
Special rules
Breakneck Speed: The warbands in this scenario are
navigating their way through the city as fast as possible, and
will not stop until they can see the horde of treasure they are
searching for. All models in this scenario must run the
maximum distance allowed every turn until they are within
line of sight of the goal, at which point they will slow down.
However the warbands are aware of their competition, and
will occasionally shoot toward each other in a desperate
attempt to slow the other band down. Because of this, models
armed with a shooting weapon may shoot while running, with
a -1 “to hit” penalty conferred for doing so. This penalty is
added to any other penalties as normal, such as over half
distance or being behind cover. This penalty will also replace
any “move or shoot” rules that a weapon would normally be
subject to: for example, a model armed with a handgun may
shoot his handgun while moving during this scenario, but will
suffer a -1 to hit for doing so. Reloading rules apply as
normal.
If a model moving at breakneck speed is brought into base-to
-base contact with another model, the model will not count as
charging for purposes of striking first, or gain +1 attack; the
combat will be played out normally using initiative value.
This is to represent the model's reckless speed, which is not
the same as a well-planned charge into combat, which would
allow them to strike first and gain +1 attack.
Models are considered to be moving at breakneck speed only
while they are approaching the goal. Once they have line of
sight to the goal they will not be compelled to move as
quickly or fire as recklessly, and as such the rules for
movement, shooting, etc. will return to normal on their next
turn.
Ending the game
The battle ends when one warband fails a Rout test.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Race Winners. All heroes in the warband that reaches the
stash of treasure first gain +1 Experience


Rewards
The winning warband may plunder the treasure horde after
the battle, keeping anything it finds. Roll a D6 for each item
on the following table, with the exception of the gold crowns,
which the warband always finds.
D6 Result
1 4D6 + 10 gold crowns.
2 A plain brown chest containing D3 helmets.
3 A small, unmarked, black chest containing D3 vials of poison.
You may choose whichever poison you wish, and may choose
more than one type of poison. Each vial is enough for one
application.
4 A worn, well-traveled wooden shipping crate filled with
weapons from far off lands. Roll a D3. On a roll of 1, you
have found a dwarf axe. On a roll of 2, you have found a
Hochland long rifle. On a roll of 3, you have found an elf bow.
Note that you may need the weapons training skill to use these
weapons, but you may sell them for the normal price (half
their retail value).
5 A gallantly decorated military crate, locked and branded with
the royal seal of Bretonnia. Inside you find a knight's lance,
and on a roll of 5+, a suit of gromril armor.
6 An ornately carved and decorated armoire, inside which hangs
a randomly generated magical artifact. Roll on the magical
artefact's table, re-rolling for any artifacts that have already
been discovered during this campaign.



##### Scenario: Happy Harpy Hunting Grounds

By Chris
The ruined buildings of Mordheim are home to many strange and
fantastical creatures, a number of which are the subjects of rumours
about hidden riches. Occasionally warbands will attempt to
discover whether these rumours are true. Most of the time these
adventurers are never seen again, but often enough they return
laden with treasures; often enough, that is, to convince the rest that
it’s worth a try...
A group of three Harpies have nested in one of the tall buildings in
the edge of the ruined city, and their scavenging and attacks on
unfortunate warbands has ensured a sizeable stash of valuables. In
fact, the Harpies have been nesting on some rather sizeable shards
of wyrdstone closely resembling eggs of a sort. Partially due to their
maternal instinct and probably due to the corrupting influence of the
wyrdstone the Harpies have grown extremely protective of their nest
and will guard it to the death if need be.
Terrain
Start by set one of the taller building (6" or taller) in the
centre of the playing area (The top of this is where the
Harpies have built their nest), then each player takes it in turn
to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or
other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within
an area roughly 4' x 4'. Ladders may be placed in nearby
buildings, but none in the building occupied by the Harpies.
Set-up
The scenario is for two warbands and a third player whom
would control the three Harpies.
Special rules
Will not rout: The Harpies have mistaken the wyrdstone in
their nest for Harpy eggs and will fight to the death to protect
them.
Warbands
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest chooses who
sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all his warriors within 8" of that edge. His
opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. If more
warbands are used then uses the Players use the normal
warband setup rules (see ‘Setting up the warbands’) also the
amount of harpies will increase by D3 per warband.
Starting the game
The Harpies go first before any of the warbands.
Ending the game
A warband wins if all three Harpies have been taken out of
action and the other warband has routed, or the Harpies win if
both of the warbands rout before the Harpies have all been
taken out of action.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband(s)
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
Wyrdstone
Roll a D3 to determine how many wyrdstone shards are
included. The nest is also full of various items. The winning
warband may roll on the chart provided to determine what is
contained in the nest.
Harpy Nest Contents
Besides the wyrdstone the following items may be in the
Harpy nest. Roll 1D6 per line. On the number shown, or
better, the item is present.
D6 Item
5+ 2D6gc
3+ Jewelled dagger
5+ Heavy armor
6+ Ithilmir sword
3+ Gems worth 30gc
6+ Wolf cloak
5+ Straggler*
3+ Lucky charm
4+ D3 shields
5+ D3 helmets
6+ D3 swords
* Somehow this unfortunate sod was whisked away to the
Harpy nest. What they had planned for him is unknown, but
he may aid you in your Exploration phase either this game or
next (see pg 217).


##### Scenario: The Lost Prince

By Michael Havener
Travelling entertainers often tell tales of the ruined city and because
of this, sons of the privileged classes often see the city of Mordheim
as one big romantic adventure. Sometimes one will run away from
home to join a mercenary warband and make a name for himself.
Often these individuals are killed before they even get to the city but
once in a while one will get lucky and actually make it that far.
Sometimes their families are happy to see the young fool go but once
in a while, a rich merchant or noble will actually pay to have his
son saved from his inevitable fate in Mordheim.
The warbands have heard rumours that a powerful man’s son has
wandered into the ruins and a handsome reward will be paid for his
return.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
The merchant’s son is initially placed in the centre of the
board. He will wander D6" in a random direction at the start
of each of the first player’s turns, until someone ‘rescues’
him. If a warband member comes into contact with the
merchant’s son (through normal movement, NOT through
charging – this is an exception to the normal rules and
represents that the merchant’s son is not the enemy and
should not be engaged in combat), the boy will attach himself
to that member and follow him around. If the ‘rescuer’ is
taken out of action, flees or routs, the merchant’s son will
attach himself to the next warband member to contact him.
Should someone wish to attack the merchant’s son, he has the
same stats as a Youngblood (see the Mercenary warband in
the Mordheim rulebook) and is armed with a sword and
dagger. If he is killed, no reward will be issued to the
winning warband, of course.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get the
merchant’s son off the table. That warband (and any allied
warband) is the winner.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Reward
The grateful father awards the winning warband with the
following treasure. Note that you roll for each item
separately, apart from gold crowns, which are always
received.
Item D6 Needed
5D6 GC Automatic
D3 swords 4+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Shield 4+
Helmet 4+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+


##### Scenario: The Pool

By Michael Havener
Rumours abound about a pool in the city whose waters have
magical powers of healing. The warband’s patrons believe the
magical properties of the water are due to a large deposit of
wyrdstone within the pool. The warbands have been sent to collect
as much wyrdstone from the pool as they can.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
piece of terrain should be a pool of water roughly 6" in
diameter. The objective of the scenario is to gather all the
wyrdstone from the pool. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario - the pool is too spooky to scout out without backup!
Special Rules
Roll a D3+3 to find out how many pieces of wyrdstone are in
the pool. The pool is shallow and may be entered. Any Hero
spending an entire turn within 1" of the pool doing nothing
else but searching for wyrdstone may roll at the end of his
turn to see if he finds some. On a D6 roll of 1-2, that player
has found one of the pieces in the pool. No Hero may search
within 1" of another model (friendly or enemy), as models
that are too close together disturb the waters for each other,
so that neither may see the bottom. Only as many pieces of
wyrdstone may be found as were rolled at the beginning of
the game, any searching after that is useless. A Hero can
carry any amount of wyrdstone without any penalty. Heroes
cannot transfer their wyrdstone to another warrior. If the
Hero who is carrying a counter is taken out of action, place
the counter on the table again where he fell. Another warrior
can then pick up these counters simply by moving into
contact with them.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’, above).
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is
carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he
receives +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: Ambush!

By Michael Havener
The defending warband has recently discovered a rich deposit of
wyrdstone. Unfortunately, word has leaked out about their find and
warbands throughout the city are hunting them, determined to take
the treasure for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'.
Special rules
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article).
Each of the defending warband’s Heroes carries D3 pieces of
wyrdstone. If a Hero carrying wyrdstone is taken out of
action, place a number of counters, equal to the amount of
wyrdstone he was carrying, on the ground where he fell. Any
Hero moving into contact with them may pick up these
wyrdstone shards.
Warbands
All the models in the defending warband must be set up
within 6" of the centre of the board. The attacking warbands
are then set up as normal.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling highest has the first
turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the table
(based on where players placed their warbands) from there.
Ending the game
Do not roll for Rout tests during this game. Instead, the game
will last 8 turns or until all the wyrdstone shards have been
carried off the board, whichever comes first. The warband
that gets the most wyrdstone shards off the table (or held by
one of its Heroes when the game ends) is considered the
winner. The defending warband may only exit the board via an attacker's deployment zone.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero is carrying a
Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he receives +1
Experience.


##### Scenario: Monster Hunt

The warbands have heard rumours that a terrible monster has come
up out of its lair beneath the city following the recent devastation
and established a new home in the ruins. You have heard stories of
such creatures and the treasure they accumulate is the stuff of
legends. You have decided to see for yourself if the rumours are
true.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 6'. The first
building should be rather large (at least 6" x 6") and open
topped, preferably ruins. This building should be placed in
the centre of the table, and this is where the monster’s new
lair is located.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
The monster’s lair is located in the central building and this is
where the beast will be. The monster is young for one of its
kind and its profile reflects this. In addition, a lifetime of
living in caverns beneath the city has kept the creature from
learning to use its wings. Therefore, unlike most monsters,
this beast cannot fly. The monster will not leave its lair for
any reason, though it will use its breath weapon against any
model in range that it can see and will, of course, attack any
model entering its lair. It will charge all models entering its
lair if possible. Its ‘turn’ is performed before whichever
player won the dice roll to go first, though it will do nothing
until someone comes near its lair. For the monster’s stats, see
‘Great beasts in Mordheim’ over the page.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn, and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When one warband (or more than one, if the players have
agreed to share the monster’s hoard) is the only one to have
any models within 6" of the monster’s lair, and the monster
has been put out of action, that warband is victorious and gets
the monster’s hoard. If two or more players have decided to
share the hoard, they must decide how to split it up. If they
cannot determine this peacefully, their warbands will have to
decide it un-peacefully!
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.

Treasure hoard
The young monster has moved its treasure hoard with it to its
new lair. Because of its age, the young monster has not
collected as much treasure as an older creature of its type.
Still, it has amassed a respectable amount. Whichever
warband has control of the monster’s lair at the end of the
game may search it to see what it contains. Note that you roll
for each item separately, apart from gold crowns, which are
always found.
Item D6 Result Needed
5D6 GC Automatic
Magical artefact (roll on artefact table) 6+
D3+1 pieces of wyrdstone 4+
Gromril axe 5+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
Suit of light armor 4+
Suit of light armor 4+
Shield 4+
Helmet 4+
D3 swords 4+
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Jewellery worth 10-60 GC 5+
Great beasts in Mordheim
If fewer than 10 games have been played in the campaign then there are D3 monsters +1 for each warband beyond the second. The monster type present is selected at random from the following:
1: Tree Kin
2: Chaos Spawns
3: River Trolls
4: Rat Ogres
5: Dwarf Thanes
6: Ogre Gorger

If more than 10 games have been played in the campaign then one of the following is present, chosen at random:
1: Chimera
2: Chaos Dragon
3: Great Unclean One (level 4 wizard, but only knows Spirit Leech. Will not channel.)
4: Demon Prince
5: Troll King (regular River Troll, but with D3 added to each stat).
6: Verminlord (will attempt to cast Warp Lightning three times every turn. Will automatically miscast on its thirteenth attempt.)



##### Scenario: The Writing on the Wall

By James Burkhouse
The warbands have each heard rumours of a map drawn on an alley
wall on Tyler Street that leads to great treasure! This alley is in the
Poor Quarter, a cluttered and twisting section of the city. Whoever
can decipher the map and keep this precious knowledge from their
enemies will gain a great advantage in the hunt for a fantastic
treasure!
TERRAIN
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. If your terrain
collection allows, a dense warren of narrow, crooked streets
is ideal. In any case, the centre of the table should have two
buildings, placed close together so as to form an alley, one
inch wide. The map will be written in this alley. Because of
the ruins, close confines of the alley, trash, etc., the alley is
considered difficult terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up in
an area roughly 4' x 4'.
WARBANDS
The warband with the lower warband rating chooses whether
to set up first or last. The first player then chooses which
table edge to set up on, and places all of his warriors within
8” of that edge. His opponent then sets up within 8” of the
opposite edge. Because of the dense, mazelike construction
surrounding Tyler Street, skills or abilities which allow
special deployment may not be used.
SPECIAL RULES
The map on the alley wall was written by a madman, and the
warriors in Mordheim will have a tough time puzzling it out
in the middle of a fight! In order to understand the map, a
hero must be moved into the middle of the alley, and must
spend two full turns doing nothing but studying the writing.
Heroes who have taken at least one Academic skill may
decipher the writing in one turn rather than two.
Once a warband has no further use for the map, they may ruin
the wall so other warbands can't follow the directions to the
treasure! The wall has 1 Wound, and a Toughness of 7.
Attacks against the wall automatically hit, and any wound
ruins the map. Anyone attacking the wall must be in the alley
(they cannot ruin the map from the other side of the wall).
The map doesn't lead to a specific treasure; rather it marks
out good routes through the Poor Quarter. Warbands who
have deciphered the map may add one of a kind in the next
exploration phase, after rolling the dice. For example a player
who rolled 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 6 could choose to add another 3
in order to find Prisoners (the result for a triple 3) rather than
a corpse (the result for a double 3). Alternatively, the player
could opt for an extra 5 or 6 in order to find something else
entirely. This addition does not affect how many Wyrdstone
shards the warband recovers. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

STARTING THE GAME
The player with the lower warband rating has first turn.
ENDING THE GAME
If one warband is able to decipher the writing on the wall,
and then ruin said writing, the scenario ends immediately,
and that warband wins.
If both warbands manage to decipher the writing, then the
scenario ends in a draw. If one warband deciphers the writing
and then routs, the game ends in a draw. If the writing is
somehow ruined before it can be deciphered by either
warband, the scenario ends in a draw.
Alternatively, if one side routs, the other wins. The winners
are assumed to decipher and orient the writing at their leisure.
EXPERIENCE
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for any enemy he puts out of action.
+1 for Deciphering the Writing. Any Hero who deciphers
the writing during the battle (limit 1 per warband) gains +1
Experience.
+1 for Ruining the Writing. Any Hero who ruins the
writing (after it has been deciphered!) earns +1 Experience.


##### Scenario: Spawn Hunting

By Thrasher Kitch
"Over there men! After it! 50 Crowns to the man who brings
that chaos beast down!" shouted Captain Alkazar to his men, as
they chased the twisted Chaos Spawn through the ruined streets
of what was once a productive farming village. In the time after
the comet fell, the streets of Mordheim were tainted by the touch
of the foul gods, and the effects visible in many areas. Men and
women bore twisted visages of their former selves, and much,
much worse was to be found. The touch of Chaos was laid
heavily on the land. Many priests of the righteous gods were
trying to do what they could, but some of the more physical
threats required a less spiritual touch, and more of a physical
beating.
In this case, a Chaos Spawn has been tracked down, and is
terrorizing its way through the remains of the city, and your
warband is chasing it, and trying to bring it down. Or maybe you're
trying to subdue it and bring it under your control, and then use it to
make it your loyal servant. Such a creature would be very, very
powerful to have under your control. However, you've run into a
snag.
Another warband has spotted you, and is closing in to intercept you
and stop the spawn themselves. What is their motive? Why are they
here? Such questions are not to be answered here.
Set Up
The setup is for two or more warbands. The warband with a
highest rating should be set up within 10" of one corner of the
board, as they are the warband hunting the spawn. Place the
spawn 16" from them, directly between them and the centre
of the board (always place it on ground level.) Place opposing
bands on the table edges opposing that player, and within 6"
of the edge. The player may pick which of the two sides he
starts on.
Note: If the warbands taking part in this campaign are highly
rated, you may be better off using multiple spawns instead of
one. So once you hit around 250, try 2, or at 375-400 try 3.
Etc. Alternatively, for multiple warbands, you could also do
it as “Number of Warbands -1” to determine how many
spawn you need.
Terrain
This scenario can take place in any locale. This could easily
be happening in the country side for Empire in Flames, or in
the ruined streets of Mordheim.
Starting the Game
The Spawn gets the first turn, and immediately make a move,
away from the band pursuing them. Then the hunting band
goes second, and roll a D6 for all other warbands taking place
in this scenario, with the highest going first.
This means the Spawn have their own turn, in addition to the
players, so here's the rundown of turn order:
Turn 1: Spawn
Turn 2: Pursuing Band (Highest Rated)
Turn 3-?: The remaining warbands, dice off for turn order.

Special Rules
Wyrdstone Necklace: Make note of which warrior(s) deliver
the killing blow to each of the spawn on the table. After the
fight, roll a D6 for each warrior who took a spawn OOA.
Whichever rolls the highest, he found a mysterious
Wyrdstone pendant around the neck of the spawn. He can
either wear it or sell the pendant to a wandering wizard for
10D6 GC. Should the warrior choose to put it on, consult the
following table for the result. (If the warrior in question is a
henchman, remove him from his existing group and place
him in his own group, which may never be added to again.).
Roll D6 after the game
1 The green stone drains the warrior of his vitality. Roll on
the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 reduce the stat
indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the warrior mutates. All
bands except chaos bands kill a mutating warrior as they start
to change, chaos bands (possessed, carnival of chaos,
beastmen and skaven) may roll a random mutation.
2 No effect beyond dark and troubled dreams.
3-6 Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9
increase the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the
player may choose any stat to increase by 1. The stone is not
powerful enough to increase a stat above a racial maximum,
if this is indicated roll again.
Ending the Game
The game ends only after the Spawn have been taken OOA
and only a single band is remaining on the table. Warbands
may voluntarily rout, following the normal instructions for
such in the Mordheim rulebook.
Experience
+1 Survival: Any Hero or Henchman group which survives
the battle gains +1 experience.
+1 Winning Leader: The Leader (or acting leader) of the
band gains +1 experience for winning the scenario.
+1 per Enemy out of action: A hero earns an additional +1
experience for each enemy they put out of action.
+1 Spawn Wound: A Hero or Henchmen group earns an
additional +1 experience for each wound they do to one of
the Spawn. (A henchman group may not gain more than +1
experience in this way.)


##### Scenario: The West Gatehouse

By Andy Tabor
There are many a vile warband that resides at Cut Throat's Den.
Cut Throat's Den is known to house unscrupulous warbands who
are some of the foulest scum to visit Mordheim. Warbands such as
the Righteous Sisters, Witch Hunters and other do-gooders would
shun such a decadent area.
The main path from Cut Throat's Den to The City of the Damned is
by the West Gatehouse. Normally, most would think nothing of
going to Mordheim via the West Gatehouse but danger lurks at
every corner of Mordheim and this area is not different. The West
Gatehouse remains guarded by a dark and sinister tree beast, and to
enter the city from this direction adventurer must first brave passing
by this monstrosity. Skeletons hang from its branches and who
knows how many skulls are entwined within its blackened roots.
Warbands tend to scale the walls or have found tunnels into the city
from the West side in order to avoid The Giant Oak that lurks at the
West Gatehouse.
The Great Oak that once stood near the ornate gates of the garden
uprooted itself and began a rampage of death and destruction. A
huge one hundred foot tall monster, it smashed through the
perimeter wall of the gardens and began to make its way to the West
Gatehouse where crowds had gathered in a desperate attempt to flee
the disaster.
With evil eyes glowing red, the instrument of the Shadowlord
stomped through the crowd sending broken bodies hurtling through
the air as its huge branches lashed out at the throng. Few managed
to escape the Northwester Quarter of the city during the disaster, as
the monster had rooted itself at the gateway slaughtering all that
dared to pass.
Many warbands have disappeared when they have ventured through
the West Gatehouse. There are rumours The Giant Tree guards not
only the West Gatehouse but treasure. The treasure horde has been
rumoured to include wyrdstone, jewels, armor, weapons, precious
and rare items.
Many warbands have decided to go after the Giant Tree together to
split the riches but many have died by the hands of The Great Oak
or my each other as truces only last as long as a warband wants.
Terrain
This is another great opportunity to use your Warhammer
Fortress set to use as a gatehouse and a surrounding wall
section. There should be terrain but not too much to block the
movement of The Great Oak. Each player takes it in turn to
place a piece of terrain, a ruined building, tower, wall, or
similar piece of terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up
within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6' if you want to use more
warbands or just like more space. Leave a 6” x 6” square in
the middle of the board for the Great Oak.
Set-up
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Special rules
The Giant Oak will be placed in the middle of the board.
Each warband will roll a D3 for the amount of Dark Dryad
that will be placed on the board. The Dark Dryad will be
placed on the board before players roll for sides and will be
placed 8 inches within the Giant Oak. The Giant Oak and
Dark Dryad will always be the last “player” go move or take
its turn.
The profiles of the Giant Oak and Dark Dryad can be found
in the Beasts, Monsters & Townsfolk section of the
Rulebook.

Warbands
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands). The Giant Oak and evil arbours will
be considered the last warband in order of play. I would
suggest that players take turns playing the Evil arbours.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one has failed their
Rout Test. If two or more warbands are left they may ally
together to end the game but they must agree on how to split
the hoard (if Great Oak and minions are OOA). If an
agreement cannot be worked out then they will fight it out
until a “gentlemen's” agreement is reached.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 For wounding the Shadow Dryad. Any Hero or
Henchman earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on
the Shadow Dryad.
+1 For wounding the Giant Oak. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Giant
Oak.
+2 For taking the Giant Oak out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Giant Oak out of action gets a bonus
+2 experience.


##### Scenario: The Raven Barracks

By Andy Tabor
The Raven Barracks, located North West side of Mordheim, housed
the military arm of Count Steinhardht. The Empire was deeply
embroiled in a bitter civil war. During this turmoil, Count
Steinhardt refused to commit his forces to any of the three warring
factions. The Count had the finest uniforms made for his soldiers. As
the Empire went to war, expending valuable resources on arms and
soldiers Mordheim grew rich in selling arms and supplies at
extortionate prices to any side. The weapons were for top quality
and craftsmanship.
After the great disaster the barracks are empty of soldiers. The
soldiers have perished or left the city as fast as they could. Now
many warbands are attempting to get to the Raven Barracks to stock
up on supplies for themselves or to sell them at a profit. The City of
the Damned is a dark and deadly place. The route to the barracks is
dangerous and leaving alive from the barracks might be more
difficult than the warbands think.
(Ideas taken from Town Cryer 23/25: Space McQuirk, Nick
Jakos, and Mark Havener)
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, wall, or similar piece of terrain. We
suggest the terrain is set up within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6'.
This is a great opportunity to use your Warhammer Fantasy
Fortress as the Raven Barracks. The barracks should be an
area that is at least 2' x 2' in the middle of the board. Plenty of
terrain should be around the barracks to provide cover and
some obstacles to get there.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 +1 crate for each
warband involved in the game on the tabletop to represent
where the crates are. The crates should be 10” inches away
from the table edge and 6” inches away from each other.
Once a model is in base contact with a crate they must wait
till the next turn to move with it. No warband may use
catacombs or other like skills as information provided only
gave a vague area of the barracks.
When a model First touches a crate roll a D6. If the result is a
1 then a trap has been activated. The model takes an automatic wound with no armour saves allowed. Only one trap per crate.
There are many options of supplies to have in the crates. Feel
free to change them to your gaming groups needs.
Supplies The supplies are in crates. Each crate can be carried
by a single model at normal movement rate (no running
allowed). Two models may carry a crate, in which case they
may run. While carrying a crate, the model may not fire any
missile weapons or use any spells. Cavalry, Monstrous Infantry, and Monstrous Cavalry may carry one treasure chest with no penalty. Chariots and Mounted Monsters may carry any number of chests with no penalty (though they may not move in the same turn a chest is loaded into it by another warband member) If attacked, the crate will
be dropped (unless the crate is in a chariot), ready to be carried by anyone coming into
contact with it. Once a model escapes off the board with the
crate, the model and crate cannot return to the board. Each
crate in the possession of a warband at the end of the game
earns them a roll on the Crate table.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get all his men
off his table edge with supplies or when all but one warband
have routed. If one or more warbands have allied, they may
choose to share the victory and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.

##### Scenario: The Wizard’s Mansion

By Michael Havener
Not all of the ruined buildings in the city are ordinary houses. Some
notable structures were the abodes of important town leaders or
rich merchants. Tales are told of hidden rooms filled with treasure
in such homes. The warbands have discovered the location of one
such building. Rumours abound that the former owner also dabbled
in the arcane arts, which may explain why his home was almost
untouched by the devastation.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4" x 6". The first
building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the
objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
Warbands
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article),
representing the warband that reached the mansion first. The
defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective
building. Then the attacking warbands are set up as normal.
In addition, for each attacking warband beyond the first, the
defender rolls once on the table below to determine the
additional equipment his warband gets to start with. Each
item may only be found once. If the same number is rolled
more than once, re-roll. These items represent the findings of
the warband thus far and are meant to give the warband a
chance against multiple opponents.
D6 Item Found
1 Wooden Man
2 D3 doses of Mandrake Root
3 D3 doses of Crimson Shade
4 Lucky Charm
5 Holy (Unholy) Relic
6 Cathayan Silk Cloak
All of the above are described in the Mordheim rules except
for the Wooden Man. For rules on the Wooden Man, see new
items opposite.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Wizard’s Treasure
At the end of the game the winning warband finds all of the
items on the table above which were not found before the
battle. In addition, roll on the following chart to see what
additional items the warband finds in the mansion. Note that
you’ll roll for each item separately, apart from gold crowns,
which are always found. For example, you will need to roll a
4+ to find a Tome of Magic. Then roll to see if you find the
Gromril Sword and so on.
D6 Roll Needed
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Tome of magic 4+
Gromril sword 5+
Athame 4+
D3 doses of healing herbs 4+
Dispel scroll 5+
New items
Wooden Man: Use the stats and special rules for a zombie
with +1S and +1T. The Wooden Man is an artificial construct
in the shape of a man but made of wood. It will follow the
commands of the defending warband but will not leave the
wizard’s mansion for any reason, even after the game. The
Wooden Man may obviously not be traded.
Athame: An Athame is a special silver dagger used in
magical rituals. If used in combat, it will not hold its edge.
For the first attack in a game, it will count as a normal
dagger. However, for the rest of the game it will count as a
fist attack. The Athame is worth 10 gold crowns if traded.


##### Scenario: The Gaol

The battle in the Gaol grounds is a Skirmish. Both Warbands have
happened upon the area at the same time and are fighting it out for
control, so they can loot it. Little do they realise the presence of the
dreaded ‘Warden’...
Terrain
Choose any one neutral table edge of a 4'x4' area and place a
large ruined building on the chosen table edge just on the
table. This represents a part of the Gaol. The rest of the
gaming area represents the Gaol grounds and terrain should
be set up in a mutually agreeable manner.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating decides. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge. Players cannot choose the table edge
that has the Gaol building on or the edge opposite the Gaol.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score
takes the first turn. The Warden and the Inmates (see below)
take a turn after both players have had their turn and are
effectively a third player ie, after the last player has finished
his turn, the Warden and the Inmates get their first turn. Play
then continues as normal.

Special rules
The Warden and his Lackeys: Hidden within the dark
recesses of the Gaol is a thing known by local scavengers and
warbands as ‘The Warden’. No one knows what it once was;
some say it was a large guard dog, others that it is a bonded
and mutated group of prison guards. Whatever its true
origins, the Warden now wanders the ruins of the Gaol
feeding off any foolish enough to enter its realm. The Warden
is served by a group of ‘Inmates’ – surviving convicts of the
cataclysm since driven mad. They will attack and capture any
in their wake so their master may feed.
The Inmates have the same stats as a Dreg, you can also use
Dreg models to represent Inmates on the tabletop. There are
two Inmates in the scenario for each participating warband; they will work together as a
mob and must stay within 2" of each other at all times. They
will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest
warrior. If the Inmates manage to injure a warrior then ignore
the out of action result on the Injury table, instead the warrior
will be treated as stunned for D3 turns. Whilst a warrior is
stunned the Inmates will carry the warrior towards the
Warden (unless impeded by being charged, etc) at a rate of 4"
(they cannot charge or run whilst carrying the warrior). Note
that two Inmates can carry the warrior without reduction in
their movement, however, if reduced to one Inmate then the
remaining Inmate can only move 2" a turn. If they reach the
Warden in time, the stunned warrior is consumed. The
warrior is taken out of action and is considered dead for the
purposes of the campaign.
If this scenario is rolled before 10 games have been played then the Warden has the same statistics and abilities as a
Possessed. If more than 10 games have occured the Possessed gains +1 to all its characteristics. The Warden will move towards – and charge, if in
range – the nearest warrior. If it wins a combat it will move
towards the next nearest warrior.
NOTE: Both the Warden and the Inmates all start the game
within the Gaol and move out of this building towards the
warriors that are closest to it at first and then the warrior
that is closest to them, as described in the rules above.
If a Hero enters the Gaol and remains there until the end of
the game he will gain +1 dice for Exploration (even if an
enemy warrior is present).
    Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing Warband loses and their opponents win.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Winning Leader. The Leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action (this includes the
Inmates).
+2 Slaying the Warden. Should a Hero or Henchman group
put the Warden out of action they gain +2 Experience.



##### Scenario: Executioner’s Square

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
One of the oldest places in Mordheim, Executioner’s Square was
named for obvious reasons, the daily executions were a crowd
puller making the area busy and surrounding businesses successful.
Now the gallows and chopping block stand deserted amongst the
rubble. Since Mordheim’s downfall the many victims of
Executioner’s square – the guilty and innocent alike - have returned
as restless spirits eager to scream their anger at all who pass or
linger.
Both warbands have come to Executioner’s Square with one
purpose – to fight. Such places are often the arena for so-called
‘pitched battles’, open, bloody and vicious. Little do they realise of
the latent spirits, yearning to vent their anger against them.
Terrain
This scenario is played on a 4' x 4' playing area as normal. No
buildings can be placed in a central 2' x 2' area although they
can be placed along this boundary as this represents the
square. Rubble pieces and other such flotsam can be placed in
around the square as normal. In the centre of the square, place
a piece of terrain to represent the gallows and/or chopping
block. Place terrain in the remaining gaming area as normal.
The scenario works best if this is particularly dense.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating may choose. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with highest score takes
the first turn. If the result is a tie the player with the smaller
warband, in terms of actual models, may choose to go first or
second.

Special rules
Anger of the Damned: The restless spirits of Executioner’s
Square vent their eternal anger at any who roam in or close to
the square. They manifest as concentrated and violent gusts
of wind; the howling is their screams of rage. At the
beginning of each players turn roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the
spirits stay silent and nothing happens this turn. If the result
is a 2 or more a spirit attacks. If the number is even (2, 4, 6)
then the player whose turn it is must choose one of his
warriors to be attacked. If the number is odd (3, 5) then his
opponent must choose one of the controlling player’s
warriors to be attacked. Note it is always the player whose
turn it is that is attacked by spirits, the only difference is
whether or not he or his opponent chooses the affected
model.
An attacked warrior is automatically hit by a Strength 2
attack (no armor modifiers) and is blown directly backwards
D6". If an attacked warrior is in an elevated position such as
a gantry or an upper floor of a building then there is a good
chance he may be blown off and if this is the case treat the
model as falling. If a model is blown into a piece of terrain
(such as a mound of rubble or the wall of a building) or
blown into another warrior, friend or foe, then the warrior (or
both warriors if it hits another model) is knocked down but
may get up at the start of his next turn should he survive.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing warband loses and their opponents win.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Wining Leader. The Leader of the winning Warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Trophy from the Square. If a Hero manages to stay on
the gallows (or the piece of terrain representing the gallows)
at the centre of the square for one complete turn then he gains
+1 Experience.


##### Scenario: The Great Library

By Andy Tabor
The North-East Quarter of Mordheim was renowned for trade and
learning. When Mordheim was a living city, the crowded labyrinth
of streets and market plazas were called the Merchant's Quarter,
more commonly known as the District of the Flying Horse.
Mordheim became known as the finest market of the city in the
Empire, rivalling even the busiest ports as Marienburg. There were
many traders who would claim that for the right price they could
locate any object for you so desired in a day.
Another notable aspect of the North-Eastern Quarter was the Great
Library. During the rule of the extravagant Count Ignatius
Steinhardt, the library grew extensively to become the largest
building in the entire city. The Count was particularly fond of
collecting mystical and religious tomes. Of course, unwittingly, The
Great Library managed to collect on of the largest deposits of
Daemonic and Necromantic lore in the Empire.
Now after the disaster struck Mordheim Library was engulfed by
flames from the comet. Only the bravest ever consider going
anywhere near the ruins but the lure of ancient tomes is enough to
persuade mages from across the Empire to hire warbands to
retrieve any books that they can find. For enough gold, fools can
find enough bravery to risk even this dark place.
(Credit given to TC 25 Space McQuirk and Nick Jakos.)
Terrain
Each player will take it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a small building, or other piece of terrain. If you have
one piece of terrain or several that could “act” as the Library
should be placed in the middle. Many of the tomes have been
spewed across the many blocks close to the Library. The
battle is fought in an area roughly 4' x 4'. You may want to
make the table larger if this is to be a multiplayer game.
Special Rules & Set Up
Players should then place D3 +1 Tomes for each warband
involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the
Tomes are. Each player takes it in turn to place a Tome
counter. The counters must be placed more than 10” away
from the edge of the table and at least 6” away from each
other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which
edge the warbands will play from. A warrior can carry any
amount of Tomes without any penalty. Warriors cannot
transfer their Tomes to another warrior. If a warrior is put
OOA then the Tome is placed next to where the model was
taken OOA. The Tomes cause FEAR. You must take a FEAR
test to pick one up, unless you are immune to FEAR. This is
to represent the great unknown on whether or not the Tomes
are Evil. To represent the chaotic nature of the disaster and
the many magic tomes that are scattered in the area warbands
will roll on the Random Happenings.
Warbands will begin rolling on the Random Happenings
chart when the first model touches a tome and will continue
then at the beginning of each warbands turn. Yes, the first
warband that touches a Tome will roll on the Random
Happenings chart even though it will already be in the middle
of their turn.

Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’). Special deployment may not be used for this scenario, as whatever they think they have scouted probably will probably have changed by the time their comrades arrive.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table.
Ending the game
The game ends when all the warbands but one have failed
their Rout Test. Warbands that Rout, automatically lose. If
two or more warbands have allied they may choose to share
the victory and end the game, or they may continue the game
until one warband is victorious.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader(s). The leader of the winning
warband(s) gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each Tome Picked Up. If a Hero or Henchmen is
carrying a Tome counter at the end of the game he receives
+1 Experience.
+1 For the Warband with the Most Tomes. The leader of
the warband with the most tomes at the end of the game gains
+1 Experience.
Ill Gotten Gains...
You can sell the Tomes for 25 +1D6 or choose to keep the
scroll. If you keep a scroll then roll on the chart below (1D6).
Rolling on the chart below will represent that the Hero has
decided to open the scroll and is trying to decipher its
abilities. Please nominate which Hero will be opening the
scroll.
D6 Events
1. The Hero who keeps the scroll will set out the next
    game. You may come up with some creative on why
    he cannot play the next game from opening the scroll.
2. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain +1 Initiative.
    This can take you above our racial Maximum.
3-5. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain an Academic
    Skill. Those who normally cannot gain a Academic
    Skill can gain one (1) Academic Skill. Please note that
    this is for only one time and does not grant the user to
    gain Academic Skills through normal experience.
6. The Hero who opens the scroll will gain D3
    experience.



##### Scenario: The Middle Bridge

By Andy Tabor
The Middle Bridge is the main crossing point for the City of the
Damned. Whoever holds the bridge controls all aspects of movement
in Mordheim. The bridge is rumoured to have piles of Wyrdstone or
Treasure around it but are said to be guarded by massive Trolls,
who have a strange affinity for bridges.
Terrain
The gaming table can be as big as 4' x 4' or small as 2' x 2'.
You can easily make a bridge and river out of coloured paper
or plastic.
Special Rules
Place D3 +1 Trolls for each warband in the water and within
6” inches of the bridge. Place 1 Troll for each warband in the
middle of the bridge and the remainder Trolls should be
placed in the water. I would suggest that this scenario be
limited to one to two warbands. You can have one warband
go at a time to secure the bridge or have two warbands
attempt capture and control the bridge, while fighting off the
Trolls. In addition to the normal rules for Trolls, please use
the special rules below if you like.
Fog. The area will be affected by fog. Movement and
shooting distance will be halved. You may charge as normal.
Dumb Creatures of Habit. The Trolls under the bridge have
become so practiced and cunning at taking out travellers what
when a Troll is within 6” inches of the bridge it is allowed to
take Stupidity tests at double their normal leadership (all the
way up to 8). The Trolls will stay within 6” inches of the
bridge at all times.
Massive Troll. The Wyrdstone collected by the Trolls have
made them stronger. Their wounds and attacks are now 4
versus 3.
All Alone. Trolls are used to being all alone and will ignore
this rule.
Route Tests. Trolls will ignore all route tests.
River Trolls. Enemies attempting HTH with the Troll suffer
a -1 to hit. A roll of a 6 will always hit.

Warbands
All players roll a D6 to see who deploys first, with the player
rolling the highest choosing the table edge.
Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there. The Troll
will always go last.
Ending the game
The game ends when all but one warband has failed their
route test. The routers will automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 per Troll out of Action. Any Hero earns +2 Experiences
for each Troll he puts out of action.
Winning Warband Rewards
The winning warband may gain a onetime 5D6 gold. This
will represent collecting tolls from other warbands and
merchants who peddle their wares and will be able to choose
the next scenario they play by hearing rumours from
travellers passing through.
Optional Rules
If you are playing a structured map based campaign this is an
excellent scenario to gain control over parts of Mordheim.
There are many more additions you can make to this
scenario. You can tie it into the Encampment Rules. Another
option could a continued revenue generator throughout the
campaign, thus allowing the warband who controls the bridge
some revenue generated weekly or monthly. All this can
easily be decided by your gaming group. Your gaming group
can also change the type of monsters that live at the bridge. If
someone chooses to stand off and shoot at the Trolls from a
distance and keeping the Trolls within 6” inches of the bridge
shall punished with a Chaos Spawn coming onto the playing
table from their deployment and moving as fast as possible
towards that warband to engage in HTH with that warband.
You can be creative in this endeavour and punish those
warbands who have no backbone.

#### Scenario: Last Orders!

It can be found on the ambiguous borders of the
Chaos Wastes. Managed by coolheaded landlord
Knute Alsgaard, the Last Hope inn remains neutral
ground, a sanctuary where in theory, anyone is
permitted to enter. The Last Hope has been built to
withstand the worst kinds of predators in the
territory. It is as much a fortress as it is a watering
hole for exiles.
Visitors relinquish any weapons they are carrying
upon strict inspection. Sometimes these are returned
to their owners. Alsgaard is an astute dealmaker and
the Last Hope acts as a trading post that supplies arms
and opulent goods to travellers and warriors. Patrons
suffer the Norse proprietor’s inflation in isolation.
The potent house ale never disappoints a dwarf.
An unlikely mix of clientele frequents the Last Hope.
Here is where daring adventurers from Bretonnia may
come to discuss music with a Vampire. It is where a
Kossar dines frequently with warriors of the Kurgan
tribes. Imperial soldiers exchange information with
elves while casting a shifty gaze over at the ogres who
brought in whoever they pleased to do illicit trade
with.
On this particular evening the owner of the holding
decided to turn in early. Taking the evening off
Alsgaard leaves his customers in the capable hands of
a full complement of bar staff. A drink is spilled! The
brawl begins… 

Terrain
This scenario takes place inside a large inn. The layout
of the inn is decided by the players using any suitable
terrain that they have available, although we would
suggest the following:
The site of this ‘battle’ should consist of two or three
sections, at least 10” x 10”, and not needing to be
more than 18” x 18”. There is one section to represent
each floor of the inn.
The ground floor is the location of the bar room. It
should be relatively open. It should include a bar, a
few tables plus several chairs or benches scattered
around. Stairs lead up to the upper floor. There might
be a wine cellar, a kitchen, a store room or a lavatory.
The upper floor of the inn consists of a series of
rooms off a main hallway. Each room might include a
bed. Add other furnishings you desire. Do not forget
to include a marker to represent the top of the stairs
from below. Add another set of stairs to the next level
if you have one! The Last Hope is a fortress so it has
another floor, which is in the open air. The roof! 

Warbands
Animals, Mounts, and Monsters are not permitted within the tavern. That includes dogs nowadays!

set-up
The warbands are scattered about the inn when the
trouble starts. Randomly determine which floor of the
inn each warband member begins on. Then each
player takes turns placing each warrior in his warband.
Warriors may not be placed in hand-to-hand combat. 

starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The highest scoring player
takes the first turn. 

special rules
Diving Charges: Warriors may always attempt a Diving Charge from the tables and bar, irrespective of the
height of the furniture. Stairs may also be used.
Unarmed: All weapons have been confiscated for this game. Armour can be worn including helmets and
shields. Miscellaneous equipment can be carried.
Weapons Amnesty: Due to the generally non-lethal nature of the weapons used in this fight, players
should roll twice for Injury for each warrior taken out
of action during the game, and choose the best result.
Injuries for Heroes are rolled twice. In some cases,
which result is determined to be the best may be
something the player has to decide for himself!

ending the game
The warriors have been indulging in the inn's
refreshments and are now very refreshed indeed! No
Rout tests are necessary – the winner is the player with
the last standing model. Any player may voluntarily
rout if the excitement becomes too much. 

experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action. 

random happenings
The following random happenings replace the events
described in the Random Happenings section when
using this scenario.

At the start of each player’s turn, roll a D6. If the result
is 1 then roll another D6 to determine which event
takes place. Random happenings are commonplace in
the Last Hope! 

D6 Result
1 Kitchen Hands 
The warbands are not alone in the Last Hope. Nearly
a dozen hardened warriors are employed to run the
inn and keep it safe from outsiders. Kitchen workers
and bar staff enjoy a good brawl as well!
One randomly determined member of your warband,
that is not knocked down or stunned, takes a single
Strength 3 hit from the inn staff. These attacks will not
cause Critical Hits.

2 Buxom Barmaid 
A busty serving wench flits about the bar, flirting
with patrons. This barmaid has a body to die for…
The barmaid will approach a randomly determined
model from your warband and invite him to defend
her honour against the ‘nasty man over there’. That
warrior must pass a Leadership test or move with all
haste, escaping from combat if necessary, to charge a
randomly determined model. First the player must
roll to determine which warband (including his) and
then roll again to see which model is the target. The
optional rules for escaping from combat can be found
in the rulebook.
The warrior will pursue and fight his new rival until
one of them is taken out of action.
Warriors that are immune to psychology may ignore
the barmaid’s advances.
All of the warriors know that attacking the bar staff
can only result in them getting banned. No model will
risk attacking the barmaid.

3 Liquid Courage 
Heavy quaffing of Alsgaard’s intoxicating home brew
takes its toll on even the most hardened of drinkers.
Randomly determine which model fell off the wagon.
The effects of the ale last the remainder of the battle.
Models that are immune to poison ignore this effect.
 D6 Result
 1 Blurred. The model has -1 Ballistic Skill.
 2 Bungled. The model has -1 Weapon Skill
 3 Drowsy. The model has -1 Initiative.
 4 Sluggish. The model has -1 Movement.
 5 Fortitude. The model has +1 Wound.
 6 Leathered! Roll twice on this table.
 
4 Renegade 
There is a mercenary leaning against the wall. The
veteran casually observes the mayhem, quietly
sipping from his stein. Ducking crudely improvised
projectiles, this renegade waits to offer his services.
The renegade approaches a random unengaged
warrior of your warband. The model may pay him 3
gold crowns. Any models are assumed to be carrying
some of the gold crowns from whatever is left in the
warbands treasury.
If paid, he'll toss a throwing knife at a target of the
player’s choice. On a 1-3 the renegade pockets the
gold and asks for more. The renegade continues to
take a further 3 gold crowns until a knife is thrown or
until the player chooses not to pay him.
The thrown knife will hit the target on a roll of 4+
with Strength 4.

5 Ogre Bouncer 
The landlord has hired an ogre to work on the door.
The bouncer is not at all happy that he has suddenly
got so much hard graft to do.
Place the ogre bouncer at the doorway to the inn. See
the Bestiary for the profile and rules of an Ogre. No
roll for alignment is required. The bouncer is
employed to charge towards the nearest hand-to-hand
combat, engaging as many models as possible.
If no hand-to-hand combat is taking place then the
ogre bouncer will stand his ground, watching for any
further trouble.
Re-roll this result if the ogre has been places already.

6 Ornamental Weapon 
A member of the clientele has located a sword among
the many trophies and decorations on display at the
inn. The warrior sets to work trying to prise it free
from the wall fittings. It appears to be stuck fast.
Determine a random model from the warband. If the
warrior passes a Strength test he finds a sword.

Improvised weapons
Being forbidden to bring their weapons into the bar
means that the warriors must make do with whatever
comes to hand in the Last Hope. At the start of any
turn, a warrior can search the inn for a blunt
implement to use as a bludgeoning weapon. This
could be a bowl, a stein, a cooking ladle, the leg of a
chair or a local codger’s walking stick!). Only warriors
capable of gaining experience may attempt to search.

If a search is attempted the warrior may not charge.
Roll a D6: on a 3-6 the fighter finds something
suitable, but on a 1-2 nothing close by will work and
the warrior will have to make do with his fists. A
warrior searching for a weapon in combat will strike
last that turn, regardless of success. A warrior with a
weapon may not improvise another. If a weapon is
found, treat it as a club with the following features:

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user 
Breakable: If the warrior attempts a close combat
attack with an improvised weapon and rolls a 1 to hit,
the item has broken and becomes useless. The warrior
must resort to his fists for the rest of the combat and
may search for another weapon in the next turn.
Projectile: Alternatively, a warrior may treat the Projectile:
improvised weapon as a missile. The weapon is
automatically lost after it has been thrown. A weapon
is thrown as a missile using the following features.
Range: 6”; Strength: As user;
Special Rules: Thrown Weapon 


##### Scenario: The Statue of St. Voller

The story of Saint Voller is all but lost to history, the documentation of her works largely kept within the great libraries of Mordheim. Folklore and myth is all that survives by way of her legacy, but whatever the truth may have been she is revered by the Cult of Morr as one of their matron saints. Her statue was a place of pilgrimage to many who prayed that the dead keep their rest, and due to the wild and wonton magical experimentation present in Mordheim before the meteor strike her blessings were desperately sought after lest a lost loved one be forced to live an eternity of servitude at the hands of some vile necromancer some day. When the statue miraculously survived the meteor strike many survivors deemed it a blessing of Morr itself, and survivors brought their dead by the cartload to the statue in the hopes that their deaths be consecrated and their souls kept safe. Bodies piled the pavements, and with no safe way out of the city to bury the bodies the surrounding buildings became macabre warehouses stacked to the rafters with corpses simply to keep the roads clear.

So many dead and dying in one place was never going to end well. The sheer concentration of corpses and the opportunity to desecrate a shrine to a hated nemesis drew the attention of necromancers even beyond the city walls, and for a few mortifying months the plaza surrounding the statue became a Mecca for necromancers looking to practice their arts and refresh their supply of corpses. The district is lost to the undead now, for whatever riches it may hold simply aren't worth the inevitable wall of attrition that the thousands of reanimated corpses can provide, save for the statue itself. The Statue of Saint Voller maintains the properties of her patron god Morr, an anathema to all things undead. Undead who approach find their souls drained from their bodies, eventually disintegrating into nothingness without their sustenance. Harnessing the power of this statue or corrupting it to your own ends will prove a valuable asset within the City of The Damned, but warbands will need to move quickly. Noise awakens the unquiet dead within these sardine-packed buildings

Terrain
The city is set up as per regular Mordheim. In the centre of the battlefield should be a
large statue – the shrine representing Saint Voller.

Starting the game
Roll a D6, the highest roll goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise. Special deployment rules may not be used for this scenario, no scout would be mad enough to camp out in a warehouse so zombie-infested that there's no room to stand.

Special rules
The Unquiet Dead: At the end of each round turn every building's occupants will begin to stir. Gnarled and withered hands pull at boarded-up windows, and mindless groans dryly echo through the decreasingly deserted streets. For every building on the map roll a D6. On a result of a 1 or 2 D3+1 Zombies will emerge, touching the building and placed between it and the nearest Warband member. This counts as their movement action. If a Warband Member is in the building and is not Hidden then the Unquiet Dead subtract 2 from the roll to see if they emerge. If the nearest Warband member is inside the building then all emerging zombies from that building will immediately go into combat with them, counting as charging, and dividing up between all warband members inside. These Zombies are the same as the Henchmen from the Undead warband, though they do not grant any Experience for taking Out of Action.

Shhhhh!: The Unquiet Dead ironically prefer peace and quiet, being drawn to attack sources of noise nearby. If a Blackpowder Weapon is fired the nearest two buildings to the character who fired will immediately spawn zombies as if they had just rolled a 1 or 2 in the Unquiet Dead turn. 

The Statue of Saint Voller: Though Mordheim is lost and a wholly depraved place, the spirit of Saint Voller still exerts some guardianship. Unquiet Dead will never voluntarily move within 4" of the statue, and any Undead model that ends its movement phase within this zone must take a leadership test (they may use their warband leader's leadership). For every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. The statue itself holds an inky black pendant swimming with grey and purple shadows, a Talisman of Saint Voller. This talisman may be retrieved as if it was a shard of wyrdstone, with all the same rules as wyrdstone from the Wyrdstone Hunt.

Ending the game
The game ends when either all warbands but one have failed their rout tests, or if a character escapes the board with the Talisman of Saint Voller.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle
they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy (excluding Unquiet Dead) he puts out of action.

The Talisman of Saint Voller when worn by a non-Undead character causes Terror in Undead models, even though they would usually be immune to psychology. When worn by an Undead warband leader their warband will never crumble due to the loss of a Necromancer or Heirophant, even if the leader is taken Out of Action - their studying of Morr and corruption of Voller's Talisman has made their soul-binding more potent than ever before!

##### Scenario: The Merchant Square

By Andy Tabor
The once thriving Market Square, more commonly known as the
District of the Flying Horse has become a deserted plaza. Only the
exceptionally brave or downright foolhardy dare cross the open
cobbles, where once thousands of merchants sole their wares. To
venture into the Market Square is to expose oneself to all those who
keep a close watch from the surrounding shadow. Many eyes peer
from the dark alleys and ruined buildings, in search of a fresh
opportunity to make a quick killing. There is still a vast quantity of
precious and exotic goods lying in the broken cellars of merchant's
houses for the taking.
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.
In a terrible twist of fate, the Merchants Quarter remains the most
opulent region of the accursed city. Should any adventurous soul
wish to visit the ruined library or take a chance and stroll through
the market place, it is highly likely that they may discover some rare
goods that have survived the fall. Leaving the quarter with your life
is a different matter though, for the District of the Flying Horse is
also rich pickings for those who seek to spill blood.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building or something similar. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The middle
area of the board should free of terrain (maybe a fountain or
the like to mark the centre of the square) and to have at least
a 12” inch x 12” inch square open area. This will represent
the Merchant's Square. The buildings placed outside of the
Merchant's Square will represent the Merchant's Homes and
Shoppe's.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
Warbands will begin searching the buildings for common
items. Each warband will roll 1D6 for each searchable
building. If they roll a 4+ they found a common item. In the middle of the Merchant's Square will be D3 crates per warband, working in the same way as the Raven Barracks chests. When
a warband touches a crate they must roll a D6, only rolling once per crate. On a roll of a 1 on a D6, the Black Pegasus will
appear - this replaces the traps found in the Raven Barracks chests. The Black Pegasus will appear 8” inches in on a
Random Table edge. The Black Pegasus will go in the last
turn and will attempt to fly down on the models in the
Merchant's Square. The Black Pegasus will target the closest
model in the Merchant's Square. Merchant's Square is the 12”
x 12” area in the middle of the table as the streets and alleys
would be too narrow for the Pegasus to fly into. If the Black Pegasus is encountered after 10 games have been played in the campaign then it gains +1 to each of its attributes.

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where the players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When all the crates are off the table, all but one warband has
routed, or the warbands ally.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of a winning warband gain
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of Action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each crate taken off the board. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for taking a crate off the board.
Items
Common items are found in the houses surrounding the
Market's Square. They are kept no matter if you win or loose.
Remember you need to roll a 4+ for each house to see if you
were able to locate a common item. Only one opportunity per
house. Please keep track of what homes you searched so you
can take them off the list.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Morning Star 1
D3 Spears 2
D3 Bows 3
D3 Crossbow 4
1 Suit of Heavy Armor 5
D3 Nets 6
Rare items can only come from the crates placed in the
middle of the Merchant's Square. Rare items may only be
found if the crate is taken off the table. If no crates made if
off the table then no Rare Items will be found. You will be
much too nervous looking out for the other warbands and a
Black Pegasus to open the crate in the middle of the
Merchant's Square. When the game ends, the winning
warband(s) does not automatically get the crates.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Repeater Crossbow 1
D3 Handgun 2
D3 Healing Herbs 3
1 Gromril Weapon 4
1 Dose Bugman's Ale 5
1 Eleven Cloak 6

#### Scenario: Getting Personal

This scenario is designed for campaign games with any number of players present. A personal dispute has erupted between several famous/infamous characters in Mordheim, and eager to profit from the spoils of this sort of carnage the warbands have rushed in to pick at the remains. Unfortunately they appear to have been rather swept up in it all, and with famous names aligning themselves with warbands unexpectedly they find themselves in the midst of a sudden brawl!

Terrain
The board is set up as per normal Mordheim.

Set-up
Warbands deploy in their usual locations
.
Warbands
In this scenario each warband is joined by a randomly selected character from the list of MVPs! These characters are completely controlled by the owning player, though they are treated independently from your warband. They do not count for the purposes of either warband size or as losses for routing, and if your warband routs then the player may continue to play as the MVP. They also will not drop their unique items when defeated. 

Starting the game
Determined as normal.

Ending the game
The game ends if either one warband remains and all other MVPs have been taken out of action, or if all warbands are routed and there are only MVPs left on the board. In this case there are no winners.

If a warband wins the scenario AND their MVP is still alive then they recieve a bonus 3xp to be distributed as they see fit among their heroes as the MVP thanks them after the battle and tells them some stories!


#### Scenario: The Canal (Even number of players only)

Setup: This map takes place using four tiles. Leave an 8" gap between them running down the middle of the board, this represents the canal. The middle of the board will feature four buildings with two long walkways offering crossings over the canal. These are the only two crossing points, and are what the warbands are seeking to control. The rest of the board should feature dense terrain.

Deployment: The warbands deploy up to 12" towards the canal from the corners and 8" towards the opposite table edge. Scout, Infiltrate, and Hunch may not be used in this scenario.

Special Rules: The syrupy swamp-thick muck of Mordheim's polluted canal is home to monsters disgustingly mutated and horrific enough to chill a vampire's marrow. At the start of each round turn (before the first player's go) roll a dice for each warband member in the canal. If any of these results is a 1, then the Abomination has arrived. Randomize which end of the canal it emerges from and it will then move as quickly as possible towards the opposite table edge engaging in combat with nearest model where possible. It is unaffected by the difficult terrain, and if its movement takes it to the table edge it will stop and then turn around. It will repeat this patrolling action until the game is over or it is taken out of action.

Before the comet struck the canals were infamous for their vile pollution, the canal's waters so contaminated with sewage and alchemical reagents' run-off that even droughted beggars wouldn't consider drinking it. The latent wyrdstone energies brought about by the cataclysmic meteor have hardly improved things, transforming the waters into a toxic slurry that coats the flagstones around it like bile. Attempting to leave the canal will require a climbing check as warband members struggle to find purchase on the smooth treacherous stone. This means it requires an initiative test, and mounted units will be unable to exit at all as they become bogged down in the goop. Alternatively a friendly model of the same or larger unit type can move into contact with them and take a strength test to pull them free (good luck pulling an ogre out of a swamp, Brian.) Additionally the waters are so blighted and foul that all Nurgle-aligned models suffer from Stupidity while inside it as they wantonly revel in the filth.

Ending the game: After eight turns the game will end. A warband has won the scenario if either it controls at least three out of the four objective buildings by the end of the eighth turn (only contains warband members owned by the player) or is the last warband remaining.

Rewards:
+1xp for Occupation. If the game ends by turn limit then for each building a warband controls it can give a bonus XP point to one of its occupying members. 
+1 xp for wounding the Abomination. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully wounds the Abomination gains a bonus experience.
+2xp for putting the Abomination OOA. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully puts the Abomination out of action gains a bonus experience.
Extort Tolls: Warbands that do not rout by the end of the game gain 30 gold per building they control.


The Abomination is a Monster and has the following profile:
M	WS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
2d6	4	5	6	5	1	2D6	10	-

Special Rules:
Ravenous Maw: The Abomination's great slavering orophice is yawning enough to acommodate the largest prey. There is nothing beyond its appetites. It therefore has the Heroic Killing Blow ability.
Magical Monstrosity: The Abomination is a Chaos Spawn so mutated by the twisting of reality caused by the saturation of Wyrdstone energy that the very Winds of Magic distort and tear around it. The Abomination has a 4+ ward save against wounds or failed characteristic tests caused by spells.
Terror
Large Target
No Pain: The Abomination ignores all Knocked Down and Stunned results, instead reducing its attacks characteristic to D6 until the Abomination's next turn.
Immune to Poison
Immune to Psychology


### Income

At the end of each battle, a warband may roll on the
Exploration chart. This is done as soon as a game is over so
that players can witness each other’s dice rolls. As you can
see from the chart, a warband that is just starting out has little
chance of finding the more obscure places in Mordheim.
However, a warband will make more discoveries as it goes
along thanks to its better equipment and accumulated skills.
Roll a D6 for each Hero in your warband who survives
without going out of action. This represents the warband’s
efforts to unearth wyrdstone. Do not roll for any Heroes who
went out of action during the battle; they are taken back to
the warband’s encampment to recuperate instead. So, for
example, if your warband includes four Heroes who all
survived the last battle, you can roll four dice. If you won
your last game, you may roll one extra dice. Add the results
of the dice together and consult the Exploration chart to see
how many shards of wyrdstone your warband has found.
Do not roll for Henchmen. This does not mean that they don’t
search the ruins, but instead represents the efforts of the
Heroes in coordinating the search parties. In addition, some
Henchmen like Zombies or Warhounds (for obvious reasons)
are not particularly useful when it comes to looking for
wyrdstone.

#### Rolling multiples

As well as finding shards of wyrdstone, the warband can
come across unusual places or encounter inhabitants of the
ruined city. If you roll two or more of the same number while
searching, you have found an unusual building or
encountered something out of ordinary. Consult the chart and
refer to the appropriate entry in the Exploration results.
For example, you might roll two 3’s or three 5’s, in which
case you should refer to the chart. Choose the most numerous
multiples if you score more than one set of multiples. So, if

you rolled a double 3 and a triple 5, only look up the triple 5
on the Exploration chart. In the case of two doubles or triples
look up the highest result. For example, if you rolled double
1 and double 3, look up the double 3 result.
Any money or loot you find in these locations is added
straight to the warband’s treasury. Any shards of wyrdstone
you find can be sold as normal.
#### Exploration procedure

1. Roll 1D6 for each of your Heroes who survived the battle and
one extra dice if you won, plus any extra dice allowed by skills
or equipment. Note, however, that you must pick a maximum of
six dice out of all the dice you roll, even if you are allowed to
roll seven dice or more.
2. Some things, such as skills and equipment, (like the
Mordheim Map) may allow you to re-roll dice. If your warband
includes an Elf Ranger, you may modify one dice by +1 or -1.
3. If you rolled any doubles, triples, etc, you have found an
unusual location in Mordheim. Consult the Exploration chart on
the next page to see what you find. Refer to the appropriate entry
on the following pages and follow the instructions given there.
4. Add the results together and consult the chart on the next page
to see how many shards of wyrdstone you have found. Mark
down the amount of wyrdstone on your warband’s roster sheet.
    NUMBER OF WYRDSTONE SHARDS FOUND

##### Doubles

(11) Well
The public wells, of which there were several in Mordheim,
were covered by rooves raised up on pillars and adorned
with carvings and fountains. The city was proud of its water
system. Unfortunately, like all the other wells, this one is in a
parlous state and undoubtedly polluted with wyrdstone.
Choose one of your Heroes and roll a D6. If the result is
equal to or lower than his Toughness, he finds one shard of
wyrdstone at the bottom of the well. If he fails, the Hero
swallows tainted water and must miss the next game through
sickness.

(22) Shop
The Merchants Guild shop has been thoroughly ransacked.
Even so, there are still items scattered around the single,
long room, mingled in with the rubble. Some are useful, such
as cast iron pots and pans and rolls of fine cloth. All manner
of smaller items are lying about – the sort of frippery which
no longer has a use in a devastated city with few inhabitants.
After a thorough search you find loot worth D6 GC.
If you roll a 1 you will also find a Lucky Charm (see the
Equipment section, page 53).

(33) Corpse
You find a still-warm corpse. A chipped dagger sticks out of
his back. Surprisingly, his possessions have not been looted.
To see what you find when you search the corpse, roll a D6:
D6 Result
1-2 D6 GC
3 Dagger
4 Axe
5 Sword
6 Suit of light armor

(44) Straggler
Your warband encounters one of the survivors of Mordheim,
who has lost his sanity along with all his worldly possessions.
Skaven warbands can sell the straggler to agents of Clan
Eshin (who will use the man for food or slavery) and gain
2D6 GC.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the unfortunate individual
for the glory of the Chaos gods. The leader of the warband
will gain +1 Experience.
Undead warbands can kill the man and gain a Zombie for no
cost.
Any other warband can interrogate the man and gain insight
into the city. Next time you roll on the Exploration chart, roll
one dice more than is usually allowed, and discard any one
dice. (For example, if you have three Heroes, roll four dice
and pick any three).
 
(55) Overturned Cart
Stuck in a ruined gateway is an overturned wagon – the
covered type that nobles travel in from the city to their estates
in the country. Since anyone important fled a long time ago,
what is it doing here? The horses have broken their traces, or
did someone cut them free?
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Mordheim Map (see Miscellaneous Equipment)
3-4 A purse with 2D6 GC
5-6 Jewelled sword and dagger. These can be kept or sold
at twice the value of a normal sword and dagger, but
note that the normal selling price is half the actual cost
(see the Trading section for rules on selling items), so
the jewelled sword will sell for 10 GC, for instance.
 
(66) Ruined Hovels
The street consists of ruined hovels, which are leaning over
at alarming angles. Not much worth looting here.
You find loot worth D6 GC amidst the ruins.


##### Triples

(111) Tavern
The ruin of a tavern is recognisable by its sign still hanging
on the wall. The upper part of the building is ruined, but the
cellars are cut into rock and are still full of barrels. There
are broken flagons and tankards everywhere.
You could easily sell the barrels for a good price.
Unfortunately your men are also interested in the contents!
The warband’s leader must take a Leadership test. If he
passes, the warband gains 4D6 GC worth of wines and ales
which can be sold immediately.
If he fails, the men drink most of the alcohol despite their
leader’s threats and curses. You have D6 GC worth of
alcohol left when the warband reaches their encampment.
Undead, Witch Hunter and Sisters of Sigmar warbands
automatically pass this test, as they are not tempted by such
worldly things as alcohol.

(222) Smithy
The furnace and toppled anvil make it obvious what work
was done here. Most of the iron and the tools have been
looted long ago. Coal and slag litter the floor but there may
still be weapons to be found among the debris.
Roll a D6 to determine what you find inside:
D6 Result
1 Sword
2 Double-handed weapon
3 Flail
4 D3 Halberds
5 Lance
6 2D6 GC worth of metal (add the value to your
treasury).

(333) Prisoners
A muffled sound comes from one of the buildings. Inside you
find a group of finely dressed people who have been locked in
a cellar. Perhaps they are prisoners taken by cultists, ready
to be sacrificed during Geheimnisnacht.
Possessed warbands can sacrifice the victims (undoubtedly
finishing the job of the captors). They gain D3 Experience
which is distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
Undead warbands can callously kill the prisoners and gain D3
Zombies at no cost.
Skaven can sell the prisoners into slavery for 3D6 GC.
Other warbands can escort the prisoners out of the city. For
their trouble, they are rewarded with 2D6 GC. In addition,
one of the prisoners decides he wishes to join the warband. If
you can afford to equip the new recruit with weapons and
armor, you may add a new Henchman to any of your human
Henchman groups (with the same stats as the rest of the
group, even if they have already accumulated experience).

(444) Fletcher
This hovel was once the workshop of a fletcher – a maker of
bows and arrows. There are bundles of yew staves and
willow rods everywhere.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Short bows
3 D3 Bows
4 D3 Long bows
5 Quiver of hunting arrows
6 D3 Crossbows
 
(555) Market Hall
The market hall was raised up on pillars, with the timbered
corn exchange above the open market place. The upper
storey has been badly damaged, but the covered market still
offers a good deal of shelter. The remains of the last market
day are still lying around on the cobbles. Most of this is
broken pottery and iron pots.
You find several items worth 2D6 GC in total.
 
(666) Returning a Favour
As you are returning to your encampment, you meet one of
your old acquaintances. He has come to repay an old favour
or debt.
You gain the services of a single character from your Warhammer book worth up to 75pts. They may not use any magic items. They will join your warband for the next game only before leaving. They will not contribute to your exploration dice, but do not require upkeep either - they are completely free.


##### Four of a kind

(1111) Gunsmith
You find the workshop of a Dwarf gunsmith. Its doors have
been broken down and the rooms raided, but some of the iron
strongboxes have survived intact.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1 Blunderbuss
2 Brace of pistols
3 Brace of duelling pistols
4 D3 Handguns
5 D3 Flasks of superior blackpowder
6 Hochland long rifle

(2222) Shrine
Your warband stumbles across a ruined shrine, which is so
badly damaged that it is difficult to tell which god was once
worshipped within its walls. A few images remain on the
painted plaster walls but they have been defaced by heretics.
Fragments of smashed statues lie among the ruins. Some
items appear to be covered in gold leaf, most of which has
been torn off.
Your warband may strip the shrine and gain 3D6 GC worth
of loot.
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunter warbands may save some
of the shrine’s holy relics. They will gain 3D6 GC from their
patrons, and a blessing from the gods. One of their weapons
(chosen by the player) will now be blessed and will always
wound any Undead or Possessed model on a to wound roll of
2+.

(3333) Townhouse
This three-storey house was once part of a tenement block
overlooking a narrow alleyway. The street is now in ruins,
but this house remains largely intact. Exploring it you find
that the garret leans over so far that you can step out of the
window into the attic of the house opposite.
Your warband finds 3D6 GC worth of loot.

(4444) Armorer
A breastplate hanging from a pole drew your attention to this
place, obviously too high up to be easily looted. The
workshop is ruined and the forge has been smashed. Rooting
about in the soot, you find various half-finished items of
armor.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 D3 Shields or bucklers (choose which)
3 D3 Helmets
4 D3 Suits of light armor
5 D3 Suits of heavy armor
6 Suit of Ithilmar armor
 
(5555) Graveyard
You find an old graveyard, crammed with sepulchres that are
overgrown with ivy. The monuments to the dead are
grotesque and decorated with sculpted gargoyles. The
ironwork has been ripped from some of the tombs, and stones
have toppled off. It looks as if some of the crypts have
already been broken into by tomb robbers.
Any warband apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar
may loot the crypts and graves and gains D6x10 GC worth of
loot.
If you loot the graveyard, the next time you play against
Sisters of Sigmar or Witch Hunters, the entire enemy
warband will hate all the models in your warband. Make a
note of this on your warband roster sheet.
Witch Hunters and Sisters of Sigmar may seal the graves.
They will be rewarded for their piety by D6 Experience
points distributed amongst the Heroes of the warband.
 
(6666) Catacombs
You find an entrance to the catacombs and tunnels below
Mordheim.
You can use the new tunnels you found in the next battle you
play. Position up to three fighters (not Rat Ogres or the
Possessed) anywhere on the battlefield at ground level. They
are set up at the end of the player’s first turn and cannot be
placed within 8" of any enemy models.
This represents the warriors making their way through the
tunnels, infiltrating enemy lines and emerging suddenly from
below ground.


##### Five of a kind

(11111) Moneylender’s House
A grand mansion, that is strongly built from stone, has
survived the cataclysm remarkably well. A carved coat of
arms adorns the lintel above the doorway although it has
been defaced by raiders and the symbols are now
unrecognisable. The door itself, has been smashed open with
axes and hangs open on its hinges.
Inside, hidden amongst the debris, you find D6x10 GC to add
to your treasury.

(22222) Alchemist’s Laboratory
A narrow stairway leads down into a crypt-like dwelling
which was once an alchemist’s workshop. The sign still
hangs from one hinge above the entrance. It looks as if this
was a very old building which has remained in use for
centuries although it did not survive the comet’s destruction
too well. The stone floor has strange symbols on it and there
are charts and astrological symbols painted onto the walls.
In the ruins you find loot worth 3D6 GC and a battered old
notebook. One of your Heroes may study the Alchemist’s
notebook, and the extra wisdom he gains will enable him to
choose from Academic skills whenever he gains a new skill
in addition to those skills normally available to him.

(33333) Jewelsmith
The houses in the jewellers’ quarter have all been well and
truly looted long ago. Even the rubble has been picked over
many times for fragments of gold and gems. But still, some
small but valuable items may have been overlooked.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:
D6 Result
1-2 Quartz stones worth D6x5 GC
3-4 Amethyst worth 20 GC
5 Necklace worth 50 GC
6 A ruby worth D6x15 GC
If your warband does not sell the gems, one of your Heroes
may keep them and displays them proudly. He will gain +1 to
the rolls for locating rare items as merchants flock to such an
obviously wealthy warrior.

(44444) Merchant’s House
The merchant’s house stands by the waterfront. It has a
vaulted stone undercroft which is still stacked with barrels
and bales of cloth. The foodstuffs have been looted or eaten
long ago and huge rats infest the rotting bales. Up the stairs
are the dwelling quarters, solidly built of timber, although
badly damaged you think you can still get up to them but
you’ll need to tread with care!
Inside you find several valuable objects which can be sold for
2D6x5 GC. If you roll a double, instead of finding money
you find the symbol of the Order of Freetraders. A Hero in
possession of this gains the Haggle skill.
 
(55555) Shattered Building
The comet destroyed this building almost completely, making
it unsafe for all but the most daring to explore. But places
such as this are the best for searching for wyrdstone shards.
You find D3 shards of wyrdstone amongst the ruins. In
addition take a Leadership test against the warband leader’s
Leadership value. If passed a war dog that was guarding the
building joins the warband.
 
(66666) Entrance to the Catacombs
You find a well-hidden entrance to the dark catacombs which
extend for miles beneath the city of Mordheim. Although the
entrance looks foreboding the tunnels will take hours off your
searches of the city.
You can use these tunnels to explore Mordheim more
efficiently. From now on, you may re-roll one dice when you
roll on the Exploration chart. Make a note of this in your
warband’s roster sheet. Second and subsequent catacomb
entrances you find do not grant you any additional re-rolls,
although you may find further re-rolls from other sources.


##### Six of a kind

(111111) The Pit
You have come within sight of the Pit, the huge crater created
by the comet. A black cloud still rises from it but you can see
glowing wyrdstone everywhere. This is the domain of the
Shadow Lord, the lord of the Possessed, and no-one is
welcome here – even his own followers!
If you wish, you can send one of your Heroes to search for
any wyrdstone hidden here. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the Hero
is devoured by the guardians of the Pit and never seen again.
On a roll of 2 or more he returns with D6+1 shards of
wyrdstone.

(222222) Hidden Treasure
In the depths of Mordheim, you come across a hidden chest,
bearing the coat-of-arms of one of the noble families of the
town.
When you open the chest you find the following items. Roll
for every item on the list separately (apart from the gold
crowns) to see whether you have found it. For example, on a
roll of a 4+ you find the wyrdstone.
Items D6 Result Needed
D3 Pieces of wyrdstone 4+
5D6x5 GC Auto
Holy relic 5+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D3 Gems worth 10 GC each 4+
Elven cloak 5+
Holy tome 5+
Magical artefact 5+

(333333) Dwarf Smithy
You find a solidly built stone workshop. A runic inscription
indicates that this may have been a Dwarf smithy.
Roll a D6 to see what you find:

D6 Result
1 D3 Double-handed axes
2 D3 Suits of heavy armor
3 Gromril axe
4 Gromril hammer
5 Double-handed gromril axe
6 Gromril armor

(444444) Slaughtered Warband
You find the remains of an entire warband. Broken bodies lay
scattered among the ruins, torn apart by some monstrous
creature. You see a huge shape, which looks like an immense
Possessed creature, shambling away.
After giving the dead their final rites (Sisters of Sigmar or
Witch Hunters), eating them (Skaven or Undead) or looting
them (anyone else!) you find the following items. Roll for
every item separately (apart from the gold coins and daggers)
to see if you find it. For example, on a roll of 4+ you will find
the suits of light armor.
Item D6 Result Needed
3D6x5 GC Auto
D3 Suits of light armor 4+
Suit of heavy armor 5+
D6 Daggers Auto
Mordheim Map 4+
D3 Halberds 5+
D3 Swords 3+
D3 Shields 2+
D3 Bows 4+
D3 Helmets 2+
 
(555555) Fighting Arena
During better times, Mordheim was famous for its duellists
and pit fighters. You have found one of the areas used to
train these warriors. The place is filled with training
equipment and practice weapons.
You find a training manual, which you can either sell for 100
GC or let one of your Heroes read. The extra knowledge your
Hero gleans from reading the manual entitles him to choose
from Combat skills whenever he gains a new skill, and his
WS may now be increased by an extra point above his normal
racial maximum (for example, a Human who has the book
would now have a maximum Weapon Skill of 7).
 
(666666) Noble’s Villa
You find a fine house which is partially ruined. It has been
thoroughly ransacked and all the furniture has been stripped
of its fine fabrics. Shards of broken pottery of the finest
quality are scattered over the floor.
Roll a D6. If you roll 1-2, you find D6x10 GC worth of items
and money to add to your treasury. On a roll of 3-4, you find
D6 vials of Crimson Shade. On a roll of 5-6 you find a
hidden magical artefact carefully concealed in a hidden cellar
or behind a secret door. Roll on the Magical Artefacts table.


#### Magical artefacts table

Roll a D6 and use this table to determine which item you find when a result in the Exploration chart indicates that you have
found a magical artefact. In a campaign none of these items can appear more than once, so if you find a magic item which
is already in someone else’s possession roll again – even if the warrior carrying it has been killed.

1 The Boots and Rope of Pieter
Pieter, the master thief of the Guild of Shadows, was the most
famous of all the cat burglars of Mordheim. He earned the
nickname ‘Spider’ for his daring robberies. The secret of his
success was a pair of enchanted boots and a magical rope
which he had acquired from far-off Araby.
A model wearing these boots may move normally (including
running, charging, etc) on any kind of terrain, including
vertical surfaces. When moving the model, simply adds the
distances moved horizontally to that moved vertically, with
no Initiative test needed (except to jump across gaps).

2 The Count of Ventimiglia’s Misericordia
This dagger was used by the notorious Tilean gentleman-
pirate known as the ‘Black Corsair’. It is claimed that he
found it in ancient Elven ruins and legend also has it that the
dagger’s blade cannot be damaged in any way.
The dagger is treated as a sword. Opponents wounded by it
are Stunned on a result of 1-3 (Undead are Knocked Down as
normal) and put Out Of Action on a 4-6.

3 Att’la’s World-Treading Mail
This armor was given as a present by the Dwarf Lord
Kurgan to the warlord Att’la in the time of Sigmar
Heldenhammer.
Att’la’s World-Treading Mail is a suit of Light Armour with the
following three runes inscribed on it:
Rune of Spell Eating: The Hero wearing this
armor is immune to all spells.
Rune of Passage: The Hero can move through solid
objects, like walls (this does not mean that he can
see through them).
Rune of Fortitude: The Hero has an extra wound.


4 Bow of Wasting
This bow was a gift to Count Steinhardt from the Elf lords of
the Forest of Shadows, its blighted quiver said to contain the
secrets of Morr himself.
The Bow of Wasting can be equipped by any character capable of learning Shooting Skills, has a range of 24" and a Strength of 4. If a model is successfully wounded by the Bow of Wasting then it will lose one point of Toughness in each of its recovery phases for the remainder of the game. 
 
5 Executioner’s Hood
Recovered from a shipwrecked Dark Elf vessel, this hood
carries evil glowing runes which fill the wearer with
unreasoning unfathomable bloodthirst.
A warrior wearing this becomes subject to and always will be
frenzied even if he is knocked down or stunned and adds +1 to their strength. 
The wearer never leaves combat under any
circumstances, and will always attack opponents in base
contact until they are taken out of action. If the wearer is
in contact with multiple enemies they may direct attacks at 
_incapacitated_ enemies even if there are also standing foes present.
If there are any stunned or knocked down models within the
wearer’s charge range at the beginning of his turn, he will
charge and attack the closest one, even if they are members
of his own warband! Fight the hand-to-hand combat until one
of the warriors is taken out of action.
 
6 All-Seeing Eye of Numas
This jewel was recovered from the ruins of Numas far in the
south. It gives its wielder horrific nightmares that predict his
future, but an absolute clairvoyance too.
The bearer of the All-Seeing Eye can see all models on the
table top, even if they are hidden or out of sight. He can guide
his fellow warband members through the ruins (this allows
you to roll two dice for the bearer after battle when rolling on
the Exploration chart). The bearer may also roll a D6 whenever they
are hit by an attack. On a 6 the hit is discarded.
All animals (such as War dogs, horses, etc) will be affected
by frenzy when fighting against the bearer of the All-Seeing
Eye.


#### Selling wyrdstone

Wyrdstone is tremendously valuable and is in constant
demand by Imperial nobles. This means that finding buyers
for your warband’s wyrdstone is not difficult. You do not
have to sell all your wyrdstone immediately after the battle –
you may want to hoard it and sell it later, as selling
wyrdstone in smaller quantities will increase demand and
raise the price. Unfortunately, the demands of running a
warband often mean that you will have to sell most of your
wyrdstone as soon as you find it.
The warband must spend a large portion of its income on
basic necessities such as food, drink, repair of weapons, and
new arrows and ammunition, as well as celebrating! A
warband leader is also expected to share any profits made by
selling wyrdstone between his men which means that the
more money the warband makes from such sales, the bigger
the share for the men.
The more models there are in the warband, the more it costs
to maintain and the higher the level of any profits made that
must be shared between the men. The number indicated on
the following chart is the profit in gold crowns earned after
deducting the warband’s maintenance costs. The profit is
added to warband’s treasury.

#### Sisters of Sigmar and income

Worldly possessions mean little to the Sisters, but their holy
mission to purify Mordheim of the influence of Chaos
requires supplies and weaponry, and these are much in
demand. Thus the warbands of the Sisterhood compete with
each other to gain the best weapons and equipment from the
temple’s armory.
To measure their success, the more wyrdstone the Sisters
bring to be kept under lock and key in the Vault of
Vindication in the temple at Sigmar’s Rock, the more aid
they will receive from the temple.
Thus all gold crowns in the possession of a Sisters of Sigmar
warband represent the resources that the High Matriarch will
put at their disposal. It does not represent money in a literal
sense, so you may like to think of it as faith, piety,
dedication, etc.
#### Skaven and Undead

Neither of these warbands puts much value on gold, but they
send all the wyrdstone they find to their superiors and receive
aid and resources in return. Skaven use their own currency
for trading, while the Undead are somewhat beyond petty
concepts of wealth. For Skaven, the gold crowns in the
warband’s treasury represent the warp tokens which the
Skaven use for currency, while for the Undead it represents
the favour they enjoy in the eyes of their master, Vlad von
Carstein of Sylvania.
#### Spending income

You can spend any accumulated money on weapons, armor,
hiring new warriors, buying new equipment or simply save
the money for a bigger purchase. See the Trading section for
details.


### Tr a ding

Every Settlement around the city of Mordheim has at least
one trading post, shop or merchant’s guildhouse where the
local traders sell their wares and buy wyrdstone and other
items that have been scavenged from the ruins. In a large
village such a place might cover a substantial area with many
traders and merchants offering their goods and services.
Small settlements are served by travelling traders.
All warbands are able to get new equipment one way or
another. The most unscrupulous merchants actively trade
with the Possessed Cultists, and creatures such as the Skaven
have their own network of contacts, while Vampires can send
the Dregs that serve them into the less salubrious settlements
around Mordheim, such as Cutthroats’ Haven.

#### Spending cash

After every game, a warband can collect income from
exploration, etc, and sell any wyrdstone and treasures they
have acquired. Cash can be spent on recruiting new warriors,
or on new equipment for the warband.
The price of wyrdstone varies according to current demand.
See the Income section for details.

#### New recruits

New warriors are recruited in the same way as the original
warband with the notable exception of equipment. After the
start of a campaign, a new hireling can only buy Common
items from his warband’s equipment chart freely. He may
only be given Rare items from his warband’s equipment chart
if the warband can obtain them via the normal trading rules.
Warbands may recruit whatever type of warriors the player
wishes, but the usual restrictions apply regarding the number
of Heroes, Henchmen, wizards, etc. For example, no warband
may recruit a second leader, and no Mercenary warband can
have more than two Champions.


#### New recruits and existing henchmen

#### Groups

You may add new recruits to existing Henchman groups. If
the group is relatively inexperienced, you will have no
difficulty in finding raw recruits to add to their numbers. But
more experienced gnarled veterans are not so keen on letting
novice warriors join them – and quite rightly so! Between
each battle, roll 2D6: this represents the experience of the
warriors currently available for hire. You can hire as many
warriors as you wish, as long as their combined Experience
does not exceed your dice roll. For example, if you rolled 7,
you could add a single warrior to a Henchman group with 7
Experience points, or two warriors to a Henchman group with
3 Experience points, or any combination thereof. Disregard
any excess Experience points.
As with other new Henchmen, you must pay for all their
weapons and armor, and in addition you must add 2 gold
crowns to their cost for each extra Experience point they add
to the warband’s total. New Henchmen must be armed and
equipped in the same way as existing members of the group.

#### Weapons

If a player wants to buy new weapons or other equipment for
existing warriors, refer to the Price chart that follows. The
chart lists all the equipment available in Mordheim, not just
the common weapons included in the Recruitment charts.
Rare items and weapons are not always available and vary in
price. Remember that your warriors lack the skill to use any
weapons other than the ones listed in the Recruitment charts.
You may still want to buy rare items offered to you, as your
warriors may be able to use them as they gain in experience.
Players should preferably complete any recruiting and trading
after the battle is over, making the appropriate dice rolls
whilst both players are present.
However, some players may prefer to wait until the heat of
battle has cooled and they are able to consider purchases
more carefully. Determine which rare items are offered for
sale while both players are together. The players can work
out what they will buy later.
#### Trading

Trade items are divided into two sections: common and rare
items. Common items can be bought quite readily in any of
the numerous trading posts and settlements around
Mordheim. Players may purchase as many of these items as
they want. The price of common items is fixed, so players
always pay the same rate for them.
Rare items are hard or even impossible to come by. Only
occasionally do such items turn up for sale and the price
asked is often way above the true value. These items are
often offered only to the most famous warbands, or those
with the most money.
#### Availability

The Price chart has a column marked ‘Availability’. Common
items are always available, and can be bought in any
quantity. Items marked ‘rare’ are more difficult to find. A
rare item’s availability is indicated by a number, for example
‘Rare 9’.
Whenever a Hero wants to buy a rare item, roll 2D6 and
compare the result to the number stated. If the roll is equal or
greater, the item is available. For example, you need to roll 9
or more to acquire an item marked ‘Rare 9’. You can only
buy one rare item for each successful roll. You may also only
make one roll for each Hero looking for rare items. For
example, if your warband has four Heroes, you may make
four rolls to locate rare items. Warriors taken out of action
during the last battle may not look for rare items.


#### Selling

A player may trade in weapons and equipment at the same
time he buys new ones. After all, as warbands become more
powerful they often abandon their earlier armament in favour
of something better. However, the second-hand value of
equipment is not high due to the considerable wear and tear
inflicted on it by your warriors.
Warriors can automatically sell equipment for half its listed
price. In the case of rare equipment and weapons which have
a variable price, the warband receives half of the basic cost
only (merchants are far better at haggling than your warriors).
Alternatively, weapons, armor and equipment may be
hoarded for future use (make a note on the warband roster) or
swapped around the warband from one fighter to another
(though not between warbands). As a weapon’s value is low
compared to the cost of equipping any new recruits you may
get, a warband can usually find a use for its cast-off
armaments.



#### Price chart

The following chart indicates the cost of items available for sale at trading posts. The cost of rare items is included, but such items cannot
be bought unless they are available, as already described. In some cases the price is variable, and includes a basic cost plus a variable
extra amount, for example 20+3D6 gold crowns. For these items the extra variable cost reflects the rarity of the item – the premium
which must be paid to buy it.

#### Attack Animals

The most common attack animal in the Old World is the
faithful war house, especially favoured by Witch Hunters.
Other warbands have their favoured attack animals – Giant
Rats for Skaven, Dire Wolves for Vampires, Cold One Beast-
hounds for the Druchii. Whatever the differences between the
species, that a warrior with several sets of claws and jaws
behind him is a more dangerous opponent than a warrior on
his own.

Special Rules
Model: If you purchase an Attack Animal, it will fight exactly like a
member of your warband, though it is treated as part of the
equipment of the Hero who bought it. You will need a model to
represent it on a battlefield.
Experience: Attack Animals never gain experience, and if they are
put out of action they have exactly the same chance of recovering as
Henchmen (i.e., 1-2: Dead; 3-6: Alive). Attack Animal count
towards the maximum number of warriors allowed in your warband.

Bear
Bears are large animals often found in the forests of the Old World.
Normally they are peaceful creatures but when they feel threatened
they rip into their opponents with sharp deadly claws. Their strong
arms can wrap around a Warrior and slowly squeeze the life out of
him.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Black Bear 5 3 - 4 4 2 4 2 4
Grizzly Bear 5 3 - 5 5 2 3 3 4
Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Black Bear may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
Bear Hug: If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both
of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may
choose to make a single ‘Bear Hug’ attack instead of
resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each
player must roll a D6 and add his model’s Strength to the
roll. If the Bear’s total is higher or the totals are equal, the
opposing warrior takes a single automatic wound with no
armor save allowed. If the enemy warrior’s total is higher,
the warrior has broken the Bear’s hold and suffers no damage
from the attack.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Bear out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Birds of Prey
Falcons and other birds of prey are much sort after by beast masters
as they are very useful for catching game and hindering opponents
by attacking weak spots such as the face and groin of enemy models.

Special Rules
Animal Companion: All Birds of Prey may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
Movement: A Bird of Prey can fight up to its Movement
away from it owner and will return before the end of the turn.
A Bird of Prey is never pinned in combat and may return
without having to break combat.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Bird of Prey out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.


Cave Squig
Part fungus and part flesh, these strange ferocious creatures are
almost all teeth, easily able to take a man’s leg off with a single bite.
[Greenskins Only]

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Cave Squig 2D6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5

Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Cave Squig may be an Animal
Companion to a warrior
May Ride: A Goblin may ride the Cave Squig, if you are
using the optional rules for mounts. The Goblin gains +1
armor save, and shall move at the Cave Squig’s rate of 6".
Shooting attacks hit the Goblin on a die roll of 1-2, and the
Cave Squig on a 3-6. In close combat, the opponent may
choose which to hit. The Cave Squig no longer has to follow
the ‘Minderz’ rule (see below) if it is being ridden, as the
owning model is directing its actions.
Minderz: Each Cave Squig must always remain within 6" of
it owning model, who keeps the creature in line. If a Cave
Squig finds itself without the owning model within 6" at the
start of its Movement phase, it will go wild. From that point
on, move the Squig 2D6" in a random direction during each
of its Movement phases. If its movement takes it into contact
with another model (friend or foe), it will engage the model
in hand-to-hand combat as normal. The Cave Squig is out of
the player’s control until the end of the game.
Movement: Cave Squigs do not have a set Movement
characteristic but move with an ungainly bouncing stride. To
represent this, when moving Squigs, roll 2D6 for the distance
they move. Squigs never run and never declare charges.
Instead, they are allowed to contact enemy models with their
normal 2D6" movement. If this happens, they count as
charging for the following round of close combat, just as if
they had declared a charge.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Cave Squig out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.

Chaos Hound
Some Warriors of Chaos control packs of snarling, vicious war
dogs. These creatures have been cruelly mutated by their exposure
to Chaos, and bear barbed tails, skeletal faces and sometimes extra
heads and limbs.

Cold One Beast-hound
(Dark Elves only)
The Dark Elves capture and breed many exotic creatures to fight for
them and fights between pets are often staged as a form of
entertainment amongst the Dark Elves. One such animal was
discovered in Lustria. Distantly related to Cold Ones, the Cold One
Beast-hound lives in swamps and bogs. Cold One Beast-hounds are
larger than war dogs and of similar build but are in all other
respects reptilian. Rows of sharp teeth fill its maw, and when
provoked, the Cold One Beast-hound is a very aggressive beast. The
Dark Elves capture and train these creatures to fight in battles all
over the Warhammer world.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Special Rules
Stupidity: Cold One Beast-hounds may use the basic
Leadership of it Master if they are within 6" of him.
Scaly Skin: Cold One Beast-hounds have tough scaly skin,
and are considered to have a 6+ armor save. This save
cannot be modified beyond 6 due to strength modifiers but
any result of ‘no save’ on the injury chart will negate the
unmodified 6+ save.
Fear: Cold One Beast-hounds cause Fear.
Experience
+1 For taking the Attack Animal out of action. The Hero
or Henchman that puts the Cold One Beasthound out of
action gets a bonus +1 experience.


Familiar
Wizards are often solitary, usually shunned by those who can barely
conceive of, much less understand, the power these individuals
wield. As such, they often share their lives with animal companions,
rather than more ‘sentient’ beings. Sometimes a magical link will
develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent
that the wizard begins to see through the animal’s eyes, and hear its
thoughts. Wizards in different lands favour different types of
familiars, depending on their environment: Shadow Weavers tend to
favour darkly-coloured animals that can blend into the shadows
with them easily- ravens or darkly-coloured cats are most common.
Regardless of their form, familiars are actually not normal members
of their kind at all, but rather creatures that have somehow become
attuned to the Winds of Magic.
Familiars cannot actually be purchased as normal equipment.
The cost to ‘purchase’ a familiar actually represents the cost
of materials to cast the ritual to summon a familiar and form
a magical bond with it; the Rarity level represents the
chances of the ritual actually working. As such, the cost of
the familiar must always be paid if the rarity roll is attempted,
regardless of the success of the roll. Also, only Magic User
can attempt to ‘find’ a familiar. If a familiar is found, it
should be modelled on the Magic User as with any other
piece of equipment. A familiar may be placed on a separate
base (in fact many of the familiars that GW sells come this
way), but if this is done the familiar must always remain
within 6" of the Magic User, may and it may attack enemy
models or be attacked itself, other than the effect below.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Familiar 6 4 0 4 3 1 4 1 5
Options: The Familiar can be upgraded to one of the

Special Rules
Animal Companion: The Familiars may be an Animal
Companion to a Magic User.
Re-roll: As long as the Familiar is within 1" of the Magic
User, the Magic User may re-roll one failed roll to cast a spell
each turn. The result of this re-roll must be accepted, even if
it fails.
Combat Familiar: As long as the Combat Familiar is within
1" of the Magic User, the Magic User’s Weapon Skill and
Attacks increases by 1. This may take the Magic User over
the Maximum.
Power Familiar: As long as the Power Familiar is within 1"
of the Magic User, the range of all Magic User Spell
increased by D6", roll for each spell when casted.
Spell Familiar: As long as the Spell Familiar is within 1" of
the Magic User, the Magic User may cast an extra Spell pre
turn.

Snotlings are the smallest of the green-skinned races. They are not

Wall Walk: Giant Spiders (and their riders) may walk up and
down walls without making Initiative tests. They may only
jump up to 2" across or down, but this does count as a diving
charge. When a spider jumps, its rider must make an
Initiative test; if this test is failed, something has gone wrong

Running Dismount skill, the maximum diving charge is only
2".

random direction. Should any close combat occur within 6",
it will automatically bolt directly away from the combat.
Non-combatant: Mules will not fight in combat and may not
be used to charge into combat – they will simply refuse to
move. If an enemy warrior charges a ridden mule,
immediately roll on the Whoa Boy! Table. If an unridden

and somewhat ragged cockerel. Its body is covered with a
haphazard mix of scales and feathers whilst its wings are leathery

wattles and a fearsomely sharp beak.

last moment and avoid its fate. Make an Initiative test for the
victim. If pasted there is no effect, but if it is failed the victim
is tuned to stone. Naturally, this is fatal regardless of the
number of wounds the model has. Armor will not protect
the victim, although Ward saves work as normal.

Wall Walk: Giant Spider may walk up and down walls

Gorgon
The Gorgon is a horrifying snake-headed monster with long thin
claws and sharp teeth through which the creature hisses like a
serpent. Like a Cockatrice the gaze of a Gorgon is magical and can
turn a victim to stone. Gorgons sometimes carry weapons which
they clutch awkwardly in their misshapen hands, and they dress in
robes pulled from battle corpses.

automatically, but the victim may be able to tune aside at the
last moment and avoid its fate. Make an Initiative test for the
victim. If pasted there is no effect, but if it is failed the victim
is tuned to stone. Naturally, this is fatal regardless of the
number of wounds the model has. Armor will not protect
the victim, although Ward saves work as normal.

Harpies
The Harpies are jealously protective of the wyrdstone in their nest.
If any model approaches within their charge range then they will
charge. The Harpies will try and coordinate their attacks so at least
one stays back and protects the nest. Therefore, a Harpy may
disengage from a fallen enemy model if there is an opportunity for
one of its companions to charge another model.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Harpy 4 4 0 4 4 1 2 1 6
Special Rules:
Talons: A Harpy has talons and is accustomed to fighting
unarmed so does not suffer a penalty for doing so.
Fly: A Harpy may fly up to 12". After the Movement phase
the model is assumed to have landed and may be charged. If
on the ground, a Harpy may make a full move and then use
its wings.
Drop Attack: If a Harpy is successful with both attacks in
the first round of combat then the Harpy has successfully
grabbed on to her enemy and swoops back up in the air to
drop the model allowing gravity to do the work instead. The
attacks themselves do not wound, but the person controlling
the Harpy immediately rolls a D6 and a Scatter dice. That is
the distance and direction from the place where the attack
took place that the model will rest. Next the player
controlling the Harpy rolls another D6. This is the distance
from which the model has been dropped. The result is the
Strength of hit (Strength 1 to Strength 6). Normal falling
rules apply. If a model falls into a building than count the fall
to where they land and then determine if the model falls again
if it is within 1" of the edge of the floor. Any model that is
struck by the dropped model will suffer a S3 hit. Large
targets may only be dropped D3 inches since their size and
weight make them more difficult to pick up. Once its
opponent is dropped the Harpy may continue flying and
return to the nest, preparing for another attack. Models that
are stunned or knocked down will not be charged as it is too
difficult for the Harpy to fly that close to the ground and do a
drop attack.

Henchman that puts the Harpy out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Trolls
Trolls are large and foul creatures, with gangling limbs and cold,
damp hides. Renowned for their strength and unthinking ferocity,
Trolls can rip a man apart with their bare hands. Trolls are able to
regenerate damaged flesh, and so are all but impossible to kill. Not
only that, they have the ability to vomit the corrosive contents over
their victim, melting armor, flesh and bone with ease. One
particularly vicious form of Troll is the Stone Troll, whose hide is as
tough as rock. They have the strange ability of sucking the very
power of magic out of the surrounding area. River Trolls live in the
marshlands or swamps near the banks of rivers. Their flesh exhumes
a vile slime which chokes anyone nearby.

Tunnel Dweller
By Donato Ranzato
I cannot begin to describe to appearance of these horrible
creatures. Only that they come in a multitude of forms, each more
insane then the last. To look upon them is to see madness and

Wild Boar
Large, ferocious and bad-tempered – a perfect mount for an Orc
Warlord. Orc warbands occasionally make use of these noisome
beasts while exploring the ruins of Mordheim and beyond. It isn’t
common though, as the bigger and meaner Orcs tend to take the
boars for themselves.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Boar 7 3 0 3 4 1 3 1 3
A boar has an Armor Save of 5+.
Special Rules
Ferocious Charge: Wild boars attack with +2S when
charging, due to their bulk. Note that this applies only to the
boar, not the rider.
Thick Skinned: The thick skin and matted fur of the boar
makes him very hard to wound. Boars confer an additional
+1 bonus to the rider’s Armor Save (making +2 total). If an
Orc Hero (not Henchmen) comes in contact with a boar he
may roll 2D6 to try and tame it. On a 10 or higher the boar
can be tamed and the boar will discharge D3 wyrdstone for
the Orc Hero. Sounds nasty, but Orcs don’t really care about
the smell. Anyway the Orc would make a Goblin or Snotling
clean off the wyrdstone for him.

Optional Rules
For each wyrdstone shard the wild boar eats may bring on a
mutation, Roll a D6 for each shard eaten, on a 5+ the wild
boar begin to mutate Roll on the table below for the mutation
each boar gets. Not on the forth mutation roll a D6 on a 1 – 2
the Boar will die and on a 3+ the Boar will became a chaos
spawn.
D6 Mutation
1 Tentacle: A tentacle emerges from the boar’s body. It may use
this to grapple its opponent in close combat to reduce his attacks by
-1, down to a minimum of 1. The boar may choose which attack is
lost.
2 Blackblood: If the boar loses a wound in close combat, anyone in
base contact with it suffers a S3 hit (that will not cause a critical)
from the spurting corrosive blood.
3 Spines: Any model in base contact with the boar suffers an
automatic S1 hit at the beginning of each Close Combat phase.
Spines will never cause critical hits.
4 Scorpion tail: The boar’s tail changes and grows a poisoned barb.
It gets +1A per turn in close combat. This attack is at S5 (or S2 if
the target is immune to poison).
5 Hideous: The boar causes fear.
6 Scales: Armor Save increases to 3+.

Leadership test. If this test is failed, then the daemon (of the
same Chaos God) counts as destroyed.

what, and so all daemons are totally immune to all poisons

from taking any other warrior out of action in the massed
combat, as they will be too concerned with the Daemon to
finish off their other enemy!
Combat: As if drawn by the sounds of clash of steel, The
Bloodletter will seek out the nearest close combat and join in.

charge the model with the highest Weapon Skill in order to

#### Undead

Undead Special Rules
All undead have the same basic rules that they follow:
Cause Fear: Undead are terrifying creatures and therefore
cause fear.
Immune to Psychology: Undead are not affected by
psychology and never leave combat.
Immune to Poison: Undead are not affected by any poison.
May not run: Undead are slow undead creatures and may
not run (but may charge normally).

Banshee
A Banshee is a powerful Wraith, who wails constantly in battle. Her
wail brings only death and despair to those who hear it.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Banshee 8 3 0 3 4 2 3 2 8
Weapons/Armor: None
Special rules:
Body: Once the Banshee’s wound is Reduced to 0 it is
automatically out of action.
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Ghostly Howl: A Banshee is capable of emitting an eerie
howl that brings death to mortals. Even the distant shriek of a
banshee is enough to strike horror into the hearts of the
bravest man, but anyone hearing the constant wail of a
Banshee will almost certainly die of sheer fright.
The Ghostly Howl of a Banshee is used in the Shooting
phase. A Banshee may use it even if engaged in hand to hand
combat, but only against the model(s) it is fighting. The
attack has a range of 8". The Banshee can target any model
within range and does not need line of sight to the model.
Roll 2D6+2 and deduct the Leadership value of the model.
For each point by which the roll beats the target’s leadership,
the target suffers one wound.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Ghost.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Ghost out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Ghosts
Made by McAber (Mats Carlsson), with input from the
Mordheim E-group list, especially David Stillberg.
Mordheim has many ghosts. Several that died with unfinished
business now roam the desolate streets in futile attempts to find
peace for their restless souls. Most of them are bound to specific
locations in the city, haunting burnt out buildings and ruins. Many
of the ghosts cannot do more than moan, groan and cause dread in
general. Even the more active ghosts most of the time pose no great
threat to the living. The ghost can emit a shriek that pierces the ears
and souls of the living. It will force fainthearted to run in terror
from the ghost, and make the more hardened warriors to shield their
ears and stumble away. The ghost also can draw the life-force from
a victim by touching them, but this is a fairly slow process. These
attacks are mostly non-lethal, sometimes a victim can stumble over
a ledge when fleeing from a shrieking ghost and fall to their death,
but most of the time it is enough to get away from the haunted
building to be safe.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Ghost 5 3 0 0 3 2 1 2 7
Weapons: Shriek, Cold touch, Cannot use any equipment.
Special rules
Haunt: Must be deployed within a building or ruin anywhere
on the playing field not occupied by an enemy model. Cannot
venture further than 5" from any building or ruin. (So it can
move between buildings if they are not more than 10" apart.)
Ethereal: Can pass through any object on a successful Ld-
roll. Is immune to poison. Ignores Knocked Down and
Stunned result on the injury roll. Can only be hurt by CC-
weapons, at -1 to hit. Missile weapons pass right through the
ethereal model. Magic weapons hit as normal. The ghost can
also travel vertically, but must always come to rest on a
horizontal surface at the end of its move. The ghost cannot
run when passing through an object, and if it charges through
an object it can only move its M, not the double distance.
Also when moving horizontally it cannot double its move.
Shriek: The ghost emits a soul (and ear) piercing shriek
affecting all living models (for example ghouls, dregs and
necromancers) in a 3" radius. They have to take a Ld test. If
the result is equal to or lower than the model's T, it is
unaffected altogether. If it is higher than the models T, but
not higher than it's Ld, the model staggers d3" directly from
the Ghost, clasping it's hand to it's ears. If the result is higher
than the model's Ld, it breaks and flees, just as if it failed a
Fear test. Models immune to Psychology don't break, but
staggers 1d6" instead. Only one Shriek can be made per turn,
but every extra attack spent shrieking gives +1 on the Ld roll.
Cold touch: The ghost reaches inside the enemy and touches
his inner being (it can be the soul, life-force or whatever is in
there). The ghost uses Ld instead of S to wound, and the
victim uses Ld instead of T to withstand the hit. The victim
has no armor save. Instead of causing a wound it lowers the
Toughness by 1 for the rest of the battle (accumulative). If T
reaches 0 roll on the injury table with +2 on the roll.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Ghost.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Ghost out of action gets a bonus +1

#### Monsters

Black Pegasus
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.

Young Giants
Giants are said to be forged from the earth itself. They are powerful
creatures given to rage easily and often rampage throughout the
land to deter would be adventurer. Most of the larger Giants
slumber in caves and are seldom ever seen by the eyes of man. Some
of the younger, more naive beasts are given to sleeping in the open
however, prey to monster hunters and thieves, which is of course if
the young Giant does not wake.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Young Giant 6 3 0 5 5 4 2 3 8
SPECIAL RULES
Slumbering Brute: The Young Giant is initially sleeping. In
each player’s recovery phase roll a D6, on a roll of 6 the
Young Giant awakes (add +1 to the roll for each model
within 2" of the beast, it instantly awakens if attacked). The
Giant’s turn is always before the player’s who woke it. It will
always move towards the nearest model, charging if possible
but will not attack a Truthsayer or Dark Emissary due to their
close affiliation.
Fear: Huge and obese the Young Giant causes Fear.
Enraged: Waking from its slumber the Young Giant is very
mad and will therefore not Rout for any reason.
Thick-headed: The Young Giant’s skull is as thick as a rock
and as such it can never be stunned, treat any stunned results
as knocked down instead.
Ungainly: If a Young Giant is knocked down roll a scatter
dice to determine the direction it falls in, then place the
model on its back. Any model underneath the Giant must
pass an Immediate initiative test or suffer a strength 5 hit as
the brute crushes them. The Young Giant automatically picks
itself up next turn.
Rampage: When the Young Giant attacks it is a rampage of
varied assaults. Roll a D6 to determine what it does.
1-2 Swipe. Attacks as normal.
3-4 Stomp. Makes a single attack at Strength 7 inflicting
double wounds.
5-6 Shout and Bawl. All models within 4" of the brute must
pass an immediate Strength test or be knocked down.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Monster. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Young
Giant.

Young Hydra
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Young Hydra 6 3 0 4 4 5 3 5 8
Special Rules
Fear: Despite its smaller size, the young Hydra is still a
fearsome opponent. It causes fear.
Save: The young Hydra’s scales aren’t as strong as a normal
Hydra’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The Hydra has
an armor save of 6+ that is not modified by the strength of
attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Hydra breathes, flames
leap from its mouths. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase and may be
made even if the Hydra is involved in close combat. Simply
place the small teardrop shaped template with the narrow end
at one of the Hydra’s mouths; any models under the template
will be hit by flames on a dice roll of 4+. A model hit by
flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal armor saves apply. Do
not worry about any buildings the template may cover; the
Hydra’s fire is too weak to set them alight without prolonged
exposure.
Loss of Heads: Each wound suffered by a Hydra represents
one of its many heads getting taken out of action. Because of
this, any successful (unsaved and un-regenerated) Wound to a
Hydra reduces its Attacks characteristic by one. In addition,
the loss of heads makes for fewer flames when it breathes, so
for every 2 successful Wounds, the strength of the Hydra’s
breath weapon is reduced by one (to a minimum Strength of
1). So, for example, if the Hydra has taken 3 (unsaved and
unregenerated) Wounds, it would have 2 attacks remaining
and the Strength of its breath weapon would be reduced to 2.
Regeneration: All Hydras have the ability to regrow
damaged heads. Some can do this immediately, while for
others it may take a matter of hours or even days to replace a
head that is lost. To represent this ability, at the end of each
round of close combat roll a D6 for each Wound the Hydra
has suffered that round. On a roll of 4 or more that Wound
has regenerated; any regenerated Wounds are reinstated. If a
Hydra is down to its last Wound remaining, make this roll to
regenerate before rolling on the Injury table; a successful
Regenerate roll means that no Injury roll is made.
Will not Rout: The Hydra is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its
lair for any reason.
Skull of Iron: The Hydra’s skulls are much too thick for
normal blows to penetrate. It is immune to the effects of
being stunned. Treat any stunned results from the Injury table
as a knocked down result instead (see below).
Staggered, but not down: Mighty blows will rock the Hydra
but most creatures lack the ability to truly knock it into the
dirt. Therefore, any knocked down result the Hydra receives
will instead cause it to lose 1 Attack until it recovers (during
the Recovery phase of its next turn). Multiple knocked down
results will cause it to lose multiple attacks in this way (if
taken to 0 Attacks or fewer, the Hydra may not attack until it
recovers).

Experience
+1 For wounding the Monster. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Young
Hydra.
+2 For taking the Monster out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Young Hydra out of action gets a
bonus +2 experience.

Dragon’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The young
Dragon has an Armor save of 5+ that is not modified by the
strength of attacks against it (or by other save modifiers).
Breath Weapon: When the young Dragon breathes, flames
leap from its mouth. It can use these flames as a weapon if it
wishes. This attack is made in the Shooting phase, and may
be made even if the Dragon is involved in close combat.
Simply place the small teardrop shaped template supplied
opposite with the narrow end at the Dragon’s mouth. Any
models under the template will be hit by flames on a dice roll
of 4+. A model hit by flames takes a single S3 hit. Normal
armor saves apply. Do not worry about any buildings the
template may cover; the Dragon’s fire is too weak to set them
alight without prolonged exposure.

Wyvern’s, but they are still as strong as metal. The Wyvern
has an armor save 6+ that is not modified by the strength of
attacks against it (or other save modifiers).
Envenomed Tail: The Wyvern has a whip-like tail that is
tipped with a deadly stinger. In combat it thrashes this tail
forward among its enemies, either injecting them with its
deadly venom, or simply clubbing them into submission. In
game terms this is represented by a special tail strike that the
Wyvern makes before its normal attacks in close combat.
Roll a D6. Any enemy models that are in base contact with
the Wyvern and that it may attack in the Close Combat phase
(e.g., it is either the Wyvern’s ‘turn’ or the model’s turn) that
have a lower Initiative than the dice score are automatically
hit by the Wyvern’s tail. Models with Initiative equal to or
higher than the D6 roll have successfully dodged the tail and
are not affected. Each model struck by the Wyvern’s tail
takes a Strength 4 hit.
Will not Rout: The Wyvern is far too greedy to abandon its
hoard. It will automatically pass any Rout test or any other
test that would cause it to leave its lair. It will not leave its
lair for any reason.
