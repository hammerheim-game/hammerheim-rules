| 5 | Wild Sweep | Your opponent's weapon is knocked from their hand. If they are carrying two weapons, roll to see which one they lose.

| 5-6 | Kebab! | The thrust knocks the target back with titanic force, ripping apart armour and puncturing flesh. The attack ignores armour saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. The victim is knocked backwards D6" and the attacker follows, staying in base contact. Any other models involved in the combat are separated and only the model which struck the blow and his target are still considered to be in combat. If the target collides with another model, the other model is hit once at S3. Victims larger than the attacker are only knocked back D3". |
