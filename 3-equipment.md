<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->


Life and death in Mordheim is decided by the quantity and quality of the weapons a warrior carries. This section describes the different weapons and other equipment such as armor and shields.

## Close Combat Weapons

### Axe

The axe is the traditional weapon of Empire woodsmen, and is also used as a weapon in poorer rural areas. Axes have a heavy blade and, if swung by a strong man, can cause a lot of damage. The blade of an axe can easily cut through armor, though it requires considerable strength from the wielder. Of all the warriors in the Old World, Dwarfs are the most adept at making axes. Their axes are invaluable to the warriors of the Old World and are some of the most sought after weapons. 

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Cutting Edge
Special Rules
Cutting Edge: An axe has an extra save modifier of -1, so a
model with Strength 4 using an axe has a -2 save modifier
when he hits an opponent in hand-to-hand combat.

### Ball and Chain

This is a huge iron ball with a chain attached, used by the dreaded
Night Goblin Fanatics to deal out whirling death. Enormously
heavy, it can only be used when combined with Mad Cap
Mushrooms.
[Goblins Only]
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two Handed, Incredible Force,
Cumbersome, Unwieldy, Random,

Special Rules
_Two Handed:__ A model armed with a Ball and Chain may
not use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his armor save against shooting.

__Incredible Force:__ Because the Ball and Chain is so heavy, normal armor does very little to protect against it. No armor saves are allowed against wounds caused by a Ball and Chain. In addition, any hit from a Ball and Chain is very likely to take off someone’s head (or at least break some ribs!). Therefore, any hit that successfully wounds will do 1D3 wounds instead of 1. 

__Cumbersome:__ Because the Ball and Chain is so heavy, a model equipped with one may carry no other weapons or equipment. In addition, only a model under the influence of Mad Cap Mushrooms has the strength to wield a ball and chain. 

__Unwieldy:__ The great weight of the Ball and Chain can easily tear ligaments or pull a wielder’s arms out of their sockets. While someone under the influence of Mad Cap Mushrooms will not notice such effects, when the drug wears off he will be in great pain. To represent this, at the end of the battle the controlling player must roll for Injury for each model that used a Ball and Chain, just as if the model had been taken Out Of Action. If the model was actually taken Out Of Action normally, just roll once for Injury – there is no need to make a second roll. 

__Random:__ The only way to wield a Ball and Chain is to swing it around in large circles, using your body as a counter- weight. Unfortunately this is not a very controllable fighting style, and as soon as he starts swinging his Ball and Chain, a warrior starts to lose control. The first turn he starts swinging the Ball and Chain, the model is moved 2D6" in a direction nominated by the controlling player. In his subsequent Movement phases, roll a D6 to determine what the model does: 

| D6 | Effect |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | The model trips and strangles himself with the chain. The model is taken Out Of Action. When rolling for Injury after the game, a roll of 1-3 means the model is
out permanently, instead of the normal 1-2.  |
| 2-5 | The model moves 2D6" in a direction nominated by the controlling player. |
| 6 | The model moves 2D6" in a random direction. If theplayer owns a Scatter dice (available from Games Workshop stores), roll that to determine direction. If not, see core rules for using D6 dice as scatter dice. |

### Barbed Spear

The favoured spear of the hobgoblin warriors is equipped with gruesome rear-facing barbs, which rend and tear their opponents as the spear is withdrawn after the attack. 

_[Hobgoblin Only]_

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Cavalry Bonus, +
To Wound
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a spear strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Cavalry Bonus: If using the rules for mounted models, a
mounted warrior armed with a spear receives a +1 Strength
bonus when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.
+1 To Wound: Because of the bards on the spear the user
gets a +1 To Wound.


### Beastlash

The Beastmaster make good use of their whips to goad their hounds
and creatures into combat.
[Dark Elves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Beastbane, Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack
Special Rules
Beastbane: The Beastmaster wielding a Beastlash causes
Fear in animals, any animal charged or wishing to charge a
Beastmaster with one of these weapons must first take a Fear
test as mentioned in the psychology section of the Mordheim
rules.
Cannot Be Parried: The Beastlash is a flexible weapon and
the Beastmaster use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a Beastlash may not
make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.

### Boss Pole

Some influential Goblins carry badges of office, usually taking the
form of long wooden poles with an icon or sharp blade on the end.
[Forest Goblins Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Cavalry Bonus,
Animosity
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a spear strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Cavalry Bonus: If using the rules for mounted models, a
mounted warrior armed with a spear receives a +1 Strength
bonus when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.
Animosity: The Hero with a boss pole and any Goblin
henchmen within 6" to ignore animosity.

### Brazier Iron

The brazier iron is a weapon commonly used by witch hunters. It
consists of a long heft topped by an iron cup filled with burning hot
coals. In combat, the weapon takes on an eldritch quality as the
burning embers sear the air as it is swung, opponents are sent
reeling in flaming agony as they are set on fire
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Fire,
Special Rules
Two-handed: As a brazier requires two hands to use, a
model using a brazier may not use a shield, buckler or
additional weapon in close combat. If the model has a shield
he still gets a +1 bonus to his armor save against shooting.
Fire: Whenever you score a successful hit with the brazier
staff roll a D6. If you roll a 5+ the victim is set on fire. If the
warrior survives the attack they must score a 4+ in the
Recovery phase or suffer a Strength 4 hit each turn they are
on fire and will be unable to do anything other than move.
Other warriors from the same warband may help to put the
flames out if they wish. They must move into base-to-base
contact and score a 4+in the Recovery phase.
### Censer

The censer is a hollow spiked metal ball attached to a long chain
and is swung like a flail. A plague infested shard of warpstone burns
inside the ball and emits pestilential fumes that nauseate the
opponents and may turn the wielder of the censer into a difficult
target to shoot at.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +
Special Rule: Heavy, Two-Handed, Fog of Death
Special Rules
Heavy: The +2 Strength bonus applies only to the first turn
of hand to hand combat.
Two-handed: A censer requires two hands to be used and the
wielder cannot use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in
close combat.
Fog of Death: A model hit by the censer must take a
Toughness test. Roll a D6. If the result is higher than the
Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an
automatic wound in addition to the censer hit. A result of 6
always inflicts a wound. Also the model wielding the censer
must take the test and will suffer a wound with a result of 6.
Models of undead and possessed are immune to the fog of
death and do not take the test. If the model wielding the
censer also has the fog-enhancing warpstone shards, he
becomes a difficult target to shoot at, and models targeting
him with missile weapons suffer a -1 penalty to hit.


### Claw of the Old Ones

This is a very ancient weapon made from a strange metal that is
impervious to age and corrosion. The powers of this artefact can
only be unleashed through a ritual known only to a handful of
Amazons. The blade of this weapon glows white hot and can cut
through armor as if it were paper.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +
Special Rule: No Save, Parry
Special Rules
No Save: The blade of the Claw can literally cut through
anything. A warrior wounded by a Claw receives no armor
save whatsoever.
Parry: User may parry as per normal rules.

### Dagger

Daggers and knives are extremely common, and men are allowed to
carry them in enclaves where weapons are otherwise forbidden.
Many a warrior in Mordheim has died with a dagger in his back.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armor Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armor Save: Daggers are not the best weapons
to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armor. An enemy
wounded by a dagger gains a +1 bonus to his armor save,
and a 6+ armor save if he has none normally.

### Disease Dagger

This dagger is permanently covered with a disgusting and
moulderish layer of green ooze that may infect those that are hit
with terrible diseases.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: -
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armor Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armor Save: Daggers are not the best weapons
to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armor. An enemy
wounded by a dagger gains a +1 bonus to his armor save,
and a 6+ armor save if he has none normally.
Infecting: a natural 6 on an hit roll means that the model hit
has been infected with the disease and that he must take a
Toughness test. Roll a D6. If the result is higher than the
Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an
automatic wound in addition to the dagger hit. Models of
undead and possessed are immune to this disease and do not
take the test. A model wielding two Disease Daggers gains a
+1 Attack bonus for wielding two weapons and there is no
further effect, except that the chances of rolling an infecting 6
on the hit rolls are higher.

### Double-Handed Weapon

A blow from a double-handed axe or sword can cut a foe in half and
break armor apart. It takes a long time to learn how to use these
weapons and even then only extremely strong men are able to wield
them effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Strike Last,
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a double-handed weapon
may not use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his armor save against shooting.
Strike Last: Double-handed weapons are so heavy that the
model using them always strikes last, even when charging.
### Dwarf Axe

Dwarf axes are smaller-hafted weapons made of lighter (but
stronger) materials than normal axes. Dwarf Warriors are specially
trained in their use and are able to use them as deftly as a Human
warrior might wield a sword.
[Dwarves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Cutting Edge, Parry
Special Rules
Cutting Edge: Dwarf axes have an extra save modifier of -1,
so a model with Strength 4 using a Dwarf axe has a -2 save
modifier when he hits an opponent with the axe in close
combat.
Parry: Dwarf axes offer an excellent balance of defence and
offense. A model armed with a Dwarf axe may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a
Dwarf axe may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the
highest to hit score of his opponent, the model has parried the
blow and that attack is discarded. A model may not parry
attacks made with double or more its own Strength – they are
simply too powerful to be stopped. A model may not parry
more than one attack in a single Close Combat phase; a
model armed with two Dwarf axes (or a Dwarf axe and a
sword, etc) does not get to parry two attacks but may instead
re-roll a failed parry.


### Fighting Claws

The martial arts practiced by Clan Eshin employ many unusual
weapons. The most famous of these are the Eshin Fighting Claws:
sharp metal blades attached to the paws of a Skaven warrior. It
takes a real expert to use them effectively, but an adept of Clan
Eshin is a fearsome opponent when armed this way.
[Skaven, Clan Eshin Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Pair, Climb, Parry, Cumbersome
Special Rules
Pair: Fighting Claws are traditionally used in pairs, one in
each hand. A warrior armed with Fighting Claws gets an
additional attack.
Climb: A Skaven equipped with Fighting Claws can add +
to his Initiative when making Climbing tests.
Parry: A Skaven armed with Fighting Claws may parry
blows and can re-roll a failed attempt once, in the same way
as a model armed with a sword and buckler.
Cumbersome: A model armed with Fighting Claws may not
use any other weapons in the entire battle.

### Fist

The truly desperate, who don’t even own a knife, have to fight with
their bare hands. Needless to say, their chances of survival are
comparable to Halflings going without food for eight hours!
Note: The following rule only apply to warriors who have lost their
weapons. Creatures such as Zombies, animals, etc, ignore these
rules. Warriors using their fists can only ever make 1 attack.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user -
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armor Save
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armor Save: An enemy wounded by a fist gains
a +1 bonus to his armor save, and a 6+ armor save if he
normally has none.

### Flail

The flail is a heavy weapon wielded with both hands. It normally
consists of heavy weights, often spiked, attached to a pole or handle
by means of heavy chains. Flails drain the user’s stamina quickly,
but are awesomely destructive in the hands of a skilled (or
unhinged) warrior.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Heavy, Two-handed
Special Rules
Heavy: A flail is extremely tiring to use and thus the +
Strength bonus applies only in the first turn of each hand-to-
hand combat.
Two-handed: As a flail requires two hands to use, a model
using a flail may not use a shield, buckler or additional
weapon in close combat. If the model has a shield he still gets
a +1 bonus to his armor save against shooting.

### Halberd

The halberd’s heavy blade is mounted upon a sturdy shaft of
oak or steel and has a point like a spear and a cutting edge
like an axe. Since it can be used to chop as well as thrust, it is
an adaptable weapon, but is difficult to use inside buildings.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a halberd may not use a
shield, buckler or additional weapon in close combat. If the
model has a shield he still gets a +1 bonus to his armor save
against shooting.
### Hammer, staff, mace or club

Perhaps the simplest type of weapon, these brutal, bludgeoning
instruments range from primitive wooden clubs to elaborately
forged Dwarf hammers made from the finest steel. A blow from a
mace can easily crush a skull or knock a man unconscious.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Concussion
Special Rules
Concussion: Hammers and other bludgeoning weapons are
excellent to use for striking your enemy senseless. When
using a hammer, club or mace, a roll of 2-4 is treated as
stunned when rolling to see the extent of a model’s injuries.
### Horseman’s Hammer

This is a great hammer similar to the ones used by the Knights of the
White Wolf. Far too bulky to use in one hand, a horseman’s hammer
is best suited to mounted combat, when the impetus of the horse may
be used to add to the power of the weapon.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Two-handed, Cavalry Charge
Special Rules
Two-handed: A model armed with a horseman’s hammer
may not use a shield, buckler, or additional weapon in close
combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get
a +1 bonus to his Armor save against shooting.
Cavalry Charge: A model armed with a horseman’s hammer
may use the speed of his charge to increase the might of his
attacks. A model on a steed with a horseman’s hammer gains
a further +1 Strength bonus when he charges. This bonus
only applies for that turn.
### Katar

This is an Arabian-style punch dagger. It has a handle
perpendicular to the blade and is used in a punching thrusting
manner.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: -1 Enemy Armor Save
Special Rules
-1 Enemy Armor Save: The Katar is a better weapon to use
for penetrating an enemy model’s armor. An enemy
wounded by a Katar gains a -1 bonus to his armor save.


### Lance

Lances are long, heavy spears used by mounted shock troops to rip
through armor and fling their foes to the ground. They are the
chosen weapons of Knights Templar and other wealthy warriors. To
use a lance requires great skill and strength, and only the richest
warriors ride the heavy warhorses needed to wield these mighty
weapons effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Cavalry Weapon, Cavalry Bonus
Special Rules
Cavalry Weapon: A warrior must own a warhorse to use a
lance, as it can only be used whilst he is on horseback.
Cavalry Bonus: If using optional rules for mounted models,
a warrior armed with a lance receives a +2 Strength bonus
when he charges. This bonus only applies for that turn.

### Morning Star

A morning star consists of a wooden or steel shaft with heavy chains
that have spiked steel balls attached. It is very destructive and
requires great skill to wield effectively.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +
Special Rule: Heavy, Difficult to Use
Special Rules
Heavy: The morning star is extremely tiring to use, so its +
Strength bonus applies only in the first turn of each hand-to-
hand combat.
Difficult to Use: A model with a morning star may not use a
second weapon or buckler in his other hand because it
requires all his skill to wield it. He may carry a shield as
normal though.

### Pike

The Pike is somewhat longer than a spear and is weighted so that it
can be wielded efficiently between the trees, underbrush and
between narrow buildings.
Range: Close Combat (3”)
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Length
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a Pike strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat, even if charged with a model
with a spear. After the initial round of combat resolve strikes
in Initiative order. The model can change to normal hand-to-
hand weapons after the initial round.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.
Length: Because of size and weight of the Pike only models
of man-sized or larger creatures can use pikes. Skaven,
Skinks, Halflings, etc cannot.

### Plague Sword

Clan Pestilens has created a hellish weapon, called the plague
sword. These warpstone blades carry disease and corruption with
each strike. The infection caused with each blow renders the
wounded extremely ill, and will disable even the strongest foe.
[Skaven, Clan Pestilens only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Contagion
Special Rules
Parry: Plague swords offer an excellent balance of defence
and offence. A model armed with a plague sword may parry
blows. When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with
a sword may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest
to hit score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow,
and that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks
made with double or more its own Strength – they are simply
too powerful to be stopped.
Contagion: Each blow of the plague sword carries with it a
host of diseases and pestilence. Every successful hit with the
plague sword causes two wounds. Armor saves may be
applied as normal.
### Punisher Whip

Punisher whips are used by the Pack Masters of Clan Moulder to
train their beasts. These fiendish devices are made of braided
leather, filled with razor sharp spikes. A much larger spike tips the
whip, and the Pack Masters use this quite effectively to inflict pain.
[Skaven, Clan Moulder only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Animal Scourge, Cannot Be Parried,
Whipcrack
Special Rules
Animal Scourge: The Pack Masters of Clan Moulder learn
to use these whips for the purpose of training animals. The
beasts of Clan Moulder learn that these whips are to be feared
above everything else. Any beast (Giant Rat, Wolf Rats, or
Rat Ogre) in the Clan Moulder Warband may re-roll any
failed Leadership-based test if within 6” of a model armed
with a punisher whip. On other animals, such as horses and
war dogs, are intimidated by the whistling scream of a
punisher whip passing through the air. Any animal not in the
warband, including other Skaven warbands, are affected by
fear with regards to charging a model armed with these
whips.
Cannot Be Parried: The Punisher Whip is a flexible weapon
and the warrior use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a Punisher Whip
may not make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: When the wielder charges they gain +1A for
that turn. This bonus attack is added after any other
modifications. When the wielder is charged they gain +1A
that they may only use against the charger. This additional
attack will ‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously
charged by two or more opponents they will still only receive
a total of +1A. If the wielder is using two whips at the same
time then they get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but
only the first whip gets the whipcrack +1A.


### Rapier

The rapier is a long thing blade commonly used by dualists. It is a
deadly, shard weapon capable of delivering a multitude of blows but
lacks the power of a broadsword.
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Barrage, Armor Save,
Special Rules
Parry: Like all swords, you may use a rapier to parry in hand
to hand combat. When your opponent scores a hit you must
roll a D6. If you can score greater than the highest 'to hit' roll
you have parried the blow and the attack is discarded.
Barrage: A warrior armed with a rapier rolls to hit and
wound as normal. However, if you mange to hit your
opponent but fail to wound, you may attack again just as if
you had another attack but at –1 to hit (down to a maximum
to needing a 6 to hit). You may continue attacking as long as
you hit and it is possible to strike your opponent many times,
particularly if your warrior has more then one attack on his
profile.
Armor Save: Because a rapier is a very light sword that
lacks the thick armor breaking blade of the broadsword,
armor saves are made at +1

### Saerath

The Saerath is a weapon commonly used by the wood Elves, the
Saerath or spear-stave is a staff with sword-like blades attached to
each end.
[Wood Elves Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +1
Special Rule: Parry, Extra Attack
Special Rules
Parry: Like all swords, you may use a Saerath to parry in
hand to hand combat. When your opponent scores a hit you
must roll a D6. If you can score greater than the highest 'to
hit' roll you have parried the blow and the attack is discarded.
Extra Attack: the Saerath acts like the user is armed with
two swords.

### Scythe

Scythes are normally implements used in the fields by farmers. It is
rare to see them wielded as weapons of warfare. However, the
scythe also carries with it an image of death. It is the symbol of the
Grim Reaper, the representation of famine and starvation and
disease through the lack of harvested food. Priests of Morr, when
they need to, may carry a Scythe as a weapon.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +1
Special Rule: Difficult to use, Two-Handed
Special Rules
Difficult to Use: A model with a scythe may not use a
second weapon or buckler in his other hand because it
requires all his skill to wield it. He may carry a shield as
normal though.
Two-handed: A model armed with a scythe may not use a
shield, buckler, or additional weapon in close combat. If the
model is equipped with a shield he will still get a +1 bonus to
his Armor save against shooting.

### Serpent Whip

[Lahmia Vampires and Blood Sisters only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack, +1 Enemy
Armor Save, Poisoned
Special Rules
Cannot Be Parried: The whip is a flexible weapon and the
warrior use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry its
strikes are futile. A model attacked by a whip may not make
parries with swords or bucklers.

he normally has none.

### Sigmarite Warhammer

One of the traditional weapons of the Sisterhood, the Warhammer
echoes Ghal-Maraz, the great hammer of Sigmar himself.
[Sister of Sigmar Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User +1
Special Rule: Concussion, Holy Weapon
Special Rules
Concussion: Warhammers are excellent at striking people
senseless. When using a Warhammer in close combat a roll
of 2-4 is treated as Stunned when rolling on the Injury chart.
Holy Weapon: Each Warhammer is blessed by the High
Matriarch herself before it is handed to the Sisters. The
Warhammer has a +1 bonus on all to wound rolls against any
Possessed or Undead models. Note that you will still need to
score a 6 before any modifiers in order to cause a critical hit.
Only Matriarchs and Sister Superiors may carry two
Sigmarite Warhammers.
### Spear

Spears range from sharpened sticks used by Goblins to the
impressive cavalry spears typical of the Elves.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Strike First, Unwieldy, Cavalry Bonus
Special Rules
Strike First: A warrior with a spear strikes first in the first
turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Unwieldy: A warrior with a spear may only use a shield or a
buckler in his other hand. He may not use a second weapon.

### Spiked Gauntlet

The Spiked Gauntlet is a weapon commonly used in the Pit Fights.
Act like a blade and a buckler
[Pit Fighters Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry
Special Rules
Parry: Spiked Gauntlet offer an excellent balance of defence
and offence. A model armed with a Spiked Gauntlet may
parry blows. When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed
with a Spiked Gauntlet may roll a D6. If the score is greater
than the highest to hit score of his opponent, the model has
parried the blow, and that attack is discarded. A model may
not parry attacks made with double or more its own Strength

- they are simply too powerful to be stopped. The model with
Spiked Gauntlet may re-roll any failed parries once. (And no,
your Heroes cannot learn to use it!)

### Squig Prodder

[Goblins Only]
Special Rules
This item is a long pole with a trio of spikes at the end. It is
used by Goblin Squig herders to keep their livestock in line.
Cave Squigs will recognize a Squig prodder and
automatically give the bearer more respect, as they’ve all
been on its pointy end more than once! To represent this, a
Goblin with a Squig prodder can keep all Cave Squigs within
12" from going wild, instead of the normal 6" (see the
Minderz special rule under the Cave Squig entry). In
addition, a Squig prodder is treated exactly like a spear in
hand-to-hand combat.

### Star-Blade

Of the many strange weapons the Amazons possess the Star-blade is
built like an Amazonian dagger. It is usually painted exotic colours
and contains magical properties that enhance the fighting prowess
of the Amazons.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: +1 Enemy Armor Save, Parry
Special Rules
+1 Enemy Armor Save: Star-blades are not the best
weapons to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armor. An
enemy wounded by a Star-blade gains a +1 bonus to his
armor save, and a 6+ armor save if he has none normally.
Parry: Star-blade offers an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a Star-blade may parry the first
successful blow of any combat on a 4+. The model has
parried the blow, and that attack is discarded. A model may
not parry attacks made with double or more its own Strength

- they are simply too powerful to be stopped.

### Star-Sword

This is an ancient and legendary sword that can cut through armor
as if it were a leaf.
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user +1
Special Rule: No Save, Parry
Special Rules
No Save: The great power of the Star-sword ignores all
armor saves except for ward and Dodge saves.
Parry: Star-sword offers an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a Star-sword may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a sword
may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest to hit
score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow, and
that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks made
with double or more its own Strength – they are simply too
powerful to be stopped.
### Steel Whip

Another weapon unique to the Sisterhood is the steel whip, made
from barbed steel chains.
[Sister of Sigmar Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Cannot Be Parried, Whipcrack
Special Rules
Cannot Be Parried: The steel whip is a flexible weapon and
the Priestesses use it with great expertise. Attempts to parry
its strikes are futile. A model attacked by a steel whip may
not make parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain +1A for that
turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.
### Sword

The sword is often referred to as the ‘king of weapons’. The most
common sword available, the broadsword of the Empire, is a
masterpiece by the standards of any smith: four full feet of gleaming
steel, double-edged and razor-sharp.
Swords are much more effective weapons than crude clubs and axes,
though learning to use a sword is a long and difficult process. It
takes years to truly master this weapon – most warriors in
Mordheim die long before they get this far!
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry
Special Rules
Parry: Swords offer an excellent balance of defence and
offence. A model armed with a sword may parry blows.
When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a sword
may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest to hit
score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow, and
that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks made
with double or more its own Strength – they are simply too
powerful to be stopped.



### Sword Breaker

The sword breaker is a specialist weapon wrought by only the most
talented sword smiths. Next to the hilt are two prongs concealed
within the blade that can be used to trap an opponent's blade,
twisting and snapping it with a single, well time movement.
Range: Close combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Parry, Trap Blade
Special Rules
Parry: The sword breaker allows the wielder to parry the
attacks of his opponent's in close combat. When your
opponent scores a hit, roll a D6. If you can roll greater than
the highest 'to hit' of your opponent, you have parried the
attack and the blow is wasted.
Trap Blade: Whenever you make a successful parry attempt
roll a D6. If you score a 4+, you break the weapon your
opponent was using. The weapon is now useless and they
must use another one, or if they have no other weapon, resort
to unarmed combat.

### Weeping Blades

The adepts of Clan Eshin use weapons called Weeping Blades,
murderous swords constructed with a small amount of warpstone in
their structure. A Weeping Blade constantly sweats a deadly
corrosive venom.
[Skaven, Clan Eshin Only]
Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Pair, Venomous, Parry
Special Rules
Pair: Weeping Blades are traditionally used in pairs, one in
each hand. A warrior armed with Weeping Blades gets an
additional attack.
Venomous: The venom of Weeping Blades will enter the
blood of the victim and ravage his organs and muscles. These
weapons count as being permanently coated in black lotus
(see the Equipment section). No additional poison may be
applied to Weeping Blades.
Parry: Weeping Blades are swords and can be used for
parrying.

### Whip

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As User -1

turn. This bonus attack is added after any other modifications.
When the wielder is charged they gain +1A that they may
only use against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously charged by two
or more opponents they will still only receive a total of +1A.
If the wielder is using two whips at the same time then they
get +1A for the additional hand weapon, but only the first
whip gets the whipcrack +1A.
+1 Enemy Armor Save: An enemy wounded by a whip
gains a +1 bonus to his armor save, and a 6+ armor save if
he normally has none.
## Close Combat Upgrades

### Fog-enhancing Warpstone Shards

[Skaven Clan Pestilens Only]
When put inside a censer these warpstone shards have the
peculiar characteristic of making the resulting clouds of
pestilential fumes thicker than usual. The wielder of a censer
who also have some fog-enhancing warpstone shards is a
difficult target to shoot at, and other models suffer a -1
penalty to hit when targeting him with missile weapons (Clan
Pestilens members use this item instead of the Elven Cloak).
## Special Weapon Types

### Cold Metal Weapons

Wood Elves do not use forges; they have a special smithing style
known by outsides as “Cold Forging”. Cold Forging is a mix of
both physical and magical techniques known only to the Wood
Elves. The Metal which comes from this Cold Forging technique is
call Cold Metal.
Special Rules
Because Wood elves do not use forges, they do the smithing
in a special, “cold“, way. This gives the weapon such a
special flexibility in creating; it seems to have sharper edges.
It gives the weapon a +1 to hit in close combat and costs
three times the price of a normal weapon of its kind.

### Dark Steel Weapons

Dark Steel Weapons are forged in the city of Hag Graef, the Dark
Crag. They are fashioned from Black steel, a rare form of steel
found deep within the mountains around the city. Dark Steel
weapons have wicked protrusions and serrated edges, which inflict
serious damage on an opponent.
Special Rules
The Weapons commonly made of Dark Steel are swords,
daggers or other bladed weapons. These weapons upgraded to
Dark Steel retain all of their abilities (i.e. swords can parry,
daggers grant an armor save of 6) also costs three times the
price of a normal weapon of its kind.
Critical Damage: Dark blades inflict serious damage on
their opponents, when rolling on the critical hit chart a Dark
blade will add +1 to the result.
Wicked Edge: Dark blades are set with sharp protrusions
and serrated edges which inflict serious damage on an
opponent, a roll of 2-4 on the injury table is a Stunned result.

### Gromril Weapons

Only a Dwarf Runesmith can forge a weapon from Gromril, a rare
meteoric iron. A blade fashioned from this metal will stay keen for a
thousand years.
Special Rules
A Gromril weapon has an extra -1 save modifier, and costs
four times the price of a normal weapon of its kind. You may
choose which type of hand-to-hand weapon is offered to you
as explained in the Trading section.

### Ithilmar Weapons

Elven blades are forged from priceless Ithilmar, an extremely light
but strong metal, found only in the fabled Elven kingdoms. A few of
these weapons are occasionally found in the Old World and these
are normally spoils of war, taken by the Norse raiders who pillage
the coastal settlements of the Elves.
Special Rules
An Ithilmar weapon gives its user +1 Initiative in hand-to-
hand combat, and costs three times the price of a normal
weapon of its kind. You may choose which hand-to-hand
weapon is offered to you as explained in the Trading section.
## Missile Weapons

### Blowpipe

The blowpipe is a short hollow tube which can be used to shoot
poisoned darts. While the darts by themselves are too small to cause
significant damage, the poison used by the Skaven can cause
searing agony and eventual death. The other advantage of a
blowpipe is that it is silent, and a well-hidden shooter can fire the
darts undetected.
[Skaven, Forest Goblins & Lizardman Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: 1
Special Rule: Save +1, Poison, Stealthy
Special Rules
Save +1: Allows the victim +1 to their Save, or if they have
no save roll, they may roll a 6+
Poison: The needles fired by a blowpipe are coated in a
venom very similar in its effects to the Black Lotus (if you
roll a 6 on the To Hit roll, the victim is automatically
wounded). A blowpipe cannot cause critical hits. This
weapon has a positive armor save modifier, so a model that
normally has a save of 5+ will get a save of 4+ against a
blowpipe dart. Even models that normally do not have an
armor save will get a 6+ save to take into account protection
offered by clothes, fur or the like.
Stealthy: A Skaven armed with a blowpipe can fire while
hidden without revealing his position to the enemy. The
target model can take an Initiative test in order to try to spot
the firing Skaven. If the test is successful, the Skaven no
longer counts as hidden.

### Bolas

Bolas are a set of three bronze balls on strings tied together. They
are thrown similar to a sling and are rotated around the head for
speed. The bolas is a hunting weapon and doesn’t harm the animal.
It immobilizes it and allows the hunter to either subdue it or put it
out with his spear.
[Lizardmen & Amazons Only]
Range: 16"
Strength: -
Special Rule: Dangerous, Entangle, One use only
Special Rules
Dangerous: If the to hit roll is a natural 1, the bolas brains
the caster with a S3 hit.
Entangle: A model hit by a bolas isn’t hurt, but is entangled
and the model is unable to move and suffers a WS penalty of
-2 in hand-to-hand combat. The model may still shoot and
may try to free itself in the recovery phase. If he rolls 4+ on a
D6 he is freed and may move and fight normally.
One use only: Once the Bolas has been thrown the Bolas
cannot be used for the rest of the battle, They are
automatically recovered after each battle.


### Bolt Thrower

Bolt or dart throwers are large crossbow that shoots a spear-sized
missile. They are so large that they mounted on their own stand,
often with wheels so they can be pivoted easily.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Bolt Thrower * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Hard to Fire, Large Target, Movement,
Save Modifier
Hard to Fire: Firing the Bolt Thrower requires a good crew,
a maintained weapon, and technical knowledge. The Bolt
Thrower can fire once every other turn with one crewman,
and each turn with two. All of the normal shooting rules
apply, but no Shooting skills apply to the Bolt Thrower. The
Bolt Thrower may not move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: The Bolt Thrower is still an obvious target
even from far away, and can always be targeted by enemy
shooting.
Movement: Even the Bolt Thrower requires a good crew to
move it. A single crewmember can move the Bolt Thrower at
haft his movement, two crewmembers can move it at their
full movement.
Save Modifier: Bolt Thrower is even better at penetrating
armor than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Bolt Thrower must make his armor save with a -2
modifier.

### Bow

The bow is carried by most races and used extensively in warfare. It
is a compact yet powerful weapon, that is cheap to make and easy to
maintain.
Range: 24"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None

### Crossbow Pistol

Crossbow pistols are masterpieces made by expert weapon-smiths.
They are miniature crossbows with all the power and accuracy of
the real thing. As these weapons may be easily concealed, they are
the favoured weapon of assassins.
Range: 10"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Shoot In Hand-to-Hand Combat
Special Rules
Shoot in hand-to-hand combat: A model armed with a
crossbow pistol may shoot it in the first round of a hand-to-
hand combat and this shot is always resolved first, before any
blows are struck. This shot has an extra -2 to hit penalty. Use
model’s Ballistic Skill to see whether it hits or not. This
bonus attack is in addition to any close combat weapon
attacks.

### Crossbow

A crossbow consists of a short, strong bow-stave mounted on a
wooden or steel stock. The crossbows of the Empire are made of
steel and often include a winding mechanism to draw back the
string. It takes a long time to prepare a crossbow, but a bolt fired
from one has a tremendous range and can penetrate armor easily.
Crossbows take much longer than other bows to make, so they are
expensive and relatively rare weapons. Still, they are the preferred
weapon of many in Mordheim because of their power and long
range.
Range: 30"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Move or Fire
Special Rules
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a crossbow on the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or to stand up.
### Elf Bow

Elven bows are the finest missile weapons of their kind. Constructed
from Ithilmar or wood from the Elf forests, with strings woven from
the hair of Elf maidens, Elven bows are far superior to any missile
weapons made by other races. In the hands of an Elven archer, the
Elf bow is a truly potent weapon, its long range and penetrating
power making it far superior to any bow made by humans.
Range: 36"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: -1 Save Modifier
Special Rules
-1 Save Modifier: An Elf bow has a -1 save modifier on
armor saves against it.
### Javelins

Javelins are short throwing spears specially weighted to travel quite
a distance. Although they have a much reduced range when
compared to an arrow they can cause quite considerable damage
when thrown by a person of great strength.
Range: 8"
Strength: As User
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special Rules
Thrown Weapon: Javelins are thrown weapons and the
warrior suffers no penalties for moving and shooting.
### Long Bow

A long bow is made of alternating layers of either yew or elm. A
skilled archer can hit a chosen leaf on a tree from three hundred
paces with this weapon. The long bow is favoured by experienced
archers due to its great reach and accuracy.
Range: 30"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None


### Poison Wind Globes

Poisoned wind globes are fragile spheres of a caustic hellish liquid
warpstone. When the globe is thrown and the gas is released and it
dissolves through flesh and armor with equal ease.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: Special
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special: Place the Small Blast template within 8” and roll to
hit using the Ballistic Skill. If a hit is rolled, then roll a D6 for
each model under the template. On a roll of 4+, the target
takes a single wound, immediately, with no Strength or
Toughness roll or armor save possible. If the globe misses
its intended target, roll a D3 and a scatter die.
Thrown Weapon: Poison Wind Globes are thrown weapons
and the warrior suffers no penalties for moving and shooting.
(Rare 7 for any Clan Skryre Skavens)

### Repeater Bolt Thrower

Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld
Repeater Bolt Thrower * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Fire Twice, Hard to Fire, Large Target,
Movement, Save Modifier
[Elves Only]
Fire Twice: Repeater Bolt Thrower may choose to fire twice
per turn with an extra -1 to hit penalty on both shots.
Hard to Fire: Firing the Repeater Bolt Thrower requires a
good crew, a maintained weapon, and technical knowledge.
The Repeater Bolt Thrower can fire once every other turn
with one crewman, and each turn with two. All of the normal
shooting rules apply, but no Shooting skills apply to the
Repeater Bolt Thrower. The Repeater Bolt Thrower may not
move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: The Repeater Bolt Thrower is still an obvious
target even from far away, and can always be targeted by
enemy shooting.
Movement: Even the Repeater Bolt Thrower requires a good
crew to move it. A single crewmember can move the
Repeater Bolt Thrower at haft his movement, two
crewmembers can move it at their full movement.
Save Modifier: Repeater Bolt Thrower are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a Repeater Bolt Thrower must make his armor
save with a -2 modifier.

### Repeater Crossbow

Repeater crossbows are extremely complex devices, expensive to
acquire and difficult to make. While this makes them rare, they
certainly have their uses: they can rain a deadly hail of bolts on
enemies, and a warrior using one may move quite fast and still fire
his weapon.
Range: 24"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Fire Twice
Special Rules
Fire Twice: A model armed with a repeater crossbow may
choose to fire twice per turn with an extra -1 to hit penalty on
both shots.
### Short Bow

Short bows are small, short-ranged bows that are cheap and require
little strength to use. Some cavalry carry a shortened bow which is
easier to shoot from horseback than a larger bow. Halflings also use
short bows, as they lack the strength and height required to use a
long bow.
Range: 16"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: None
### Sling

Slings are rarely used, mainly because they are no more powerful
than bows and have a shorter range. A sling is little more than a
looped strip of cloth or leather into which a stone is placed. The
sling is whirled about the slinger’s head and the sling stone is then
released towards the target. While this weapon is looked down upon
by most archers, a skilled slinger can slay a man from a
considerable distance, and the ammunition is easy to find: rocks are
everywhere and free!
Range: 18"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Fire Twice at Half Range
Special Rules
Fire Twice at Half Range: A slinger may fire twice in the
shooting phase if he does not move in the movement phase.
He cannot shoot over half range (9") though, if he fires twice.
If the model fires twice then each shot is at -1 to hit.
### Sunstaff

The Sunstaff is a long tubular stick that is made from a strange
multicoloured metal with one end hollow like a tube. Strange runes
are carved along its length and a large gemstone is set into the
pommel. Despite being extremely ancient (Elf Lore Masters of the
White Tower of Hoeth claim to have found a similar device that they
surmise is more than 20,000 years old – older than the Elven race
itself!), the wielder of the Sunstaff can discharge a beam of energy
akin to the rays of the sun.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accurate, No Save
Special Rules
Accurate: The Sunstaff does not suffer the usual -1 modifier
to hit for long range.
No Save: The beam from a Sunstaff can literally cut through
anything. A warrior wounded by a Sunstaff receives no
armor save whatsoever.



### Sun Gauntlet

This, as with all strange arcane Amazon items, is made from an
unknown multicoloured metal that is impervious to damage or
corrosion. It is covered in strange runes and a bright gemstone is
set into the hilt. In many ways this weapon resembles a Blackpowder
pistol. It can be held in one hand and when pointed at an enemy
unleashes a blinding beam of energy like the Sunstaff
Range: 12"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accurate, No Save, Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Accurate: The Sun Gauntlet does not suffer the usual -1
modifier to hit for long range.
No Save: he beam from a Sun Gauntlet can literally cut
through anything. A warrior wounded by a Sun Gauntlet
receives no armor save whatsoever.
Hand-to-Hand: The Sun Gauntlet can be used with another
close combat weapon in hand to hand combat with Strength 4
and no armor save. Because it does not require prepared
shot, this bonus attack may be used in each turn of combat.

### Throwing Stars/Knives

Throwing stars are used mainly by the assassins of the sinister
House of Shadows, or by street thugs who specialize in ambushing
the unwary. A perfectly balanced knife thrown from behind has
ended the life of many a noble and merchant in Mordheim.
Throwing knives are not suitable for close combat, as their balance
makes them unwieldy in close quarters.
Range: 6"
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Thrown Weapon
Special Rules
Thrown Weapon: Models using throwing stars or knives do
not suffer penalties for range or moving as these weapons are
perfectly balanced for throwing. They cannot be used in close
combat.

### Tufenk

This is a blowpipe that projects alchemical fire about eight feet
causing burning damage.
Range: 8"
Strength: 2
Special Rule: May fire every other turn, Causes fire
damage.
Special Rules
Causes fire damage: If you hit roll a D6, on a 4+ your
opponent is set on fire. They must roll a D6 each Recovery
phase, on a 4+ they extinguish the fire or they immediately
suffer a S4 hit and may only move. Friendly models may help
in extinguishing the model that is ablaze. They must be in
base-to-base contact and need to roll a 4+ on a D6. Against
dry targets like Mummies they are Strength 3 and on a 2+ on
1D6 the Mummy catches fire.
Prepare Shot: The Tufenk takes a complete turn to reload,
so your model may only fire every other turn.
## Missile Weapon Upgrades

### Black Arrow

One shot, non recoverable item. Anyone wounded by the
Arrow is immediately put Out of Action regardless of
remaining wounds. Strength as Bow used to fire it.

### Composite / Compound

A compound or composite bow uses different materials to make a
better Bow. The bow is usually only limited to the users own
strength and can be considerably more effective than a normal bow.
A Bow, Short bow or Longbow may be purchased as a
Compound bow. The cost is twice that of a bow’s normal
cost. A compound Bow shoots 50% further and can use the
strength of the user instead of its normal Strength.

### Fire Arrows

Fire arrows are tied with rags soaked in oil up in a tight
pouch that explodes bunched up in a tight pouch that
explodes when hitting the target, setting clothes and
equipment alight. If you hit with a fire arrow roll a D6. If you
score a 4+ your opponent has been set on fire. If the warrior

survives the attack they must score a 4+ in the Recovery
phase or suffer a Strength 4 hit each turn they are on fire and
will be unable to do anything other then move. Other warriors
from the same warband may help to put the flames out if they
wish. They must move into base-to-base contact and score a
4+ in the Recovery phase.
### Hunting Arrows

The best hunting arrows are made by the hunters of Drakwald
forest. They have sharp, barbed arrowheads which cause
excruciating pain when they hit their target. A skilled archer can
severely injure his target with a single arrow.
A model using a short bow, bow, long bow or Elf bow may
use these arrows. They add +1 to all Injury rolls.
These are available to Heroes at the time of their initial
recruitment without having to roll for Rarity. If you wish to
subsequently purchase this item during the Trading and
Exploration stages of the game, then you would have to roll
for Rarity as normal.

## Blackpowder Weapons

Blackpowder weapons are only a very recent invention in the Warhammer world. They are often unreliable and
temperamental but they do hit exceedingly hard and armor offers almost no protection, as their lead bullets can penetrate
even the strongest breastplate or shield.
Most blackpowder weapons are bought from Dwarfs at great expense, though some of the forges of Nuln and Altdorf have
started to experiment with making handguns.

### Blunderbuss

A blunderbuss is a primitive Blackpowder weapon, which fires a
hail of lead balls, rusty bolts, bent nails, and other assorted scrap
metal. It is a powerful, if erratic, weapon and takes such a long time
to load that most warriors discard it after the first shot.
Range: Special
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Shot, Fire Once
Special Rules
Shot: When your model fires the blunderbuss, draw a line
16" long and 1" wide in any direction from the firer (the line
must be absolutely straight). Any and all models in its path
are automatically hit by a Strength 3 hit.
Fire Once: It takes a very long time to load a blunderbuss so
it may only be fired it once per battle.

### Duelling Pistol

A duelling pistol is a work of art, and a gunsmith labours long and
hard to produce a single example. They are often carried by
Imperial nobles to solve disputes over love and honour, and many a
noble has died at dawn in a duel over some grievance.
Duelling pistols are prohibitively expensive weapons and common
warriors rarely have them. Even if they do manage to steal or buy
one, the ammunition is prohibitively expensive.
Some of the wealthiest warriors in Mordheim carry duelling pistols
as status symbols, commanding great respect, admiration and envy.
Range: 10"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Accuracy, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Accuracy: A duelling pistol is built for accuracy as a skilled
duelist is able to hit a coin from twenty paces. All shots and
close combat attacks from a duelling pistol have a +1 bonus
to hit.
Prepare Shot: A duelling pistol takes a complete turn to
reload, so your model may only fire every other turn. If he
has a brace of duelling pistols he may fire every turn.
Save Modifier: Duelling pistols are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a duelling pistol must make his armor save
with a -2 modifier.
Hand-to-Hand: Duelling pistols can be used in hand-to-hand
combat as well as for shooting. A model armed with a
duelling pistol and another close combat weapon gains +1
Attack, which is resolved at Strength 4 with a -2 save
modifier. This bonus attack can be used only once per
combat. If you are firing a brace of duelling pistols, your
model can fight with 2 Attacks in the first turn of close
combat. These attacks are resolved with a model’s Weapon
Skill like any normal close combat attack and likewise may
be parried. Successful hits are resolved at Strength 4 and with
a -2 save modifier, regardless of the firer’s Strength.

### Hand-held Mortar

The explosive power of a mortar, in a small enough package to be
carried by a single man, the Hand-Held Mortar enables a warrior to
launch an explosive into the midst of the enemy, sowing death and
disorder.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Explosive Radius, Move or
Fire, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier, Scatter,
SPECIAL RULE
Experimental: The Hand-Held Mortar is always subject to
the optional Blackpowder Weapons, even if they are not
normally used in your campaign. On any result other than
“BOOM!” the weapon has jammed or run out of loaded
barrels and must be reloaded.
Explosive Radius: After determining the final landing spot,
the explosion created by the bomb will cover a small area.
Place the small blast template on the final landing spot, any
models under the template will each take a single S4 hit from
the blast.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Hand-Held
Mortar in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: The Hand-Held Mortar must be reloaded after
firing, so may only be fired every other turn.
Save Modifier: Hand-Held Mortar are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Hand-Held Mortar must take its armor
save with a -2 modifier.
Scatter: If the warrior misses his roll to hit, the shot will land
2D6” in a random direction (determined using a Warhammer
directional die, using the “clock-face method” of scattering,
or whatever other method the players can agree to).


### Handgun

A handgun is a simple firearm. The quality of construction varies
ranging from the crude wooden ‘hakbuts’ of the artillery school of
Nuln, to the more sophisticated Dwarf firearms that have levers and
springs which hold the burning match, and triggers which release
the firing mechanism and fire the gun. Handguns are not terribly
reliable weapons: the gun barrel occasionally tends to explode
violently or the powder fails to ignite. But the weapon has a great
range and tremendous penetrating power, making a mockery of even
the thickest armor. In Mordheim, handguns are rare and
expensive, but a warband which can boast such a weapon will
command respect from all its rivals.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Prepare Shot: A handgun takes a complete turn to reload, so
you may only fire it every other turn.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a handgun in the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or stand up.
Save Modifier: Handguns are even better at penetrating
armor than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a handgun must take its armor save with a -2 modifier.

### Hochland Long Hunting Rifle

Hochland is a province famed for its hunters, and the preferred
weapon of its nobility when they go hunting is a long-ranged rifle.
They are extremely rare and precious weapons, and only the most
experienced weapon smiths are capable of manufacturing them.
Range: 48"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Move or Fire, Prepare Shot, Pick Target,
Save Modifier
Special Rules
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Hochland long
rifle in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face
your target or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: A Hochland long rifle takes a complete turn
to reload, so you may only fire it every other turn.
Pick Target: A model armed with a Hochland long rifle can
target any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Hochland long rifles are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength 4 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a long rifle must make his armor save with a -2
modifier.

### Jezzail Rifle

Jezzail are warpstone-firing rifle designed by the engineers of Clan
Skryre. The blast of a Jezzail can be heard over great distances, as
can the screams of the targets.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Heavy, Move or Fire, Multiple Impacts,
Prepare Shot, Pick Target, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Heavy: The Jezzail Rifle is a large heavy weapon and at
some times needed two to carry it. If used by only one then
the shooter has a -1 to movement, a -1 to hit and cannot
charge. If the shooter(s) have to flee then they would drop the
Jezzail Rifle. The Jezzail Rifle counts as being lost.
If the user has an Assistant, then there is no movement and no
to hit penalties.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Jezzail Rifle in
the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your
target or stand up from knocked down.
Multiple Impacts: the Jezzail Rifle fires a warpstone pellet
at an extremely high velocity. The pellet can penetrate
armor and flesh with ease. So any target hit cause by the
Jezzail Rifle causes d3 wounds.
Prepare Shot: A Jezzail Rifle takes a complete turn to
reload, so you may only fire it every other turn.
Pick Target: A model armed with a Jezzail Rifle can target
any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Jezzail Rifles are even better at penetrating
armor than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Jezzail Rifle must make his armor save with a -1 modifier.
(Rare 9 for any Clan Skryre Skavens)
### Nuln Shotgun

By Josh Alexander
The Nuln Shotgun is an experimental weapon that has yet to enter
general service. It is essentially a blunderbuss with a shorter, even
more flared barrel that has been modified to shoot premade
cartridges. What it lacks in range it makes up for in accuracy, and is
particularly useful in cramped city fighting.
Range: 12"
Strength: 3
Special Rule: Armor Piercing, Blast, Prepare Shot
Special Rules
Armor Piercing: Being a black powder weapon, the Nuln
Shotgun benefits from an additional -1 to the enemy’s armor
save.
Blast: The large spread of shot from the barrel makes it very
easy to hit nearby targets, but the blast quickly disperses. The
Nuln Shotgun ignores shooting penalties for cover and
movement, but suffers a –2 penalty for shooting at targets at
over half range.
Prepare Shot: The Nuln Shotgun must be reloaded after
firing, so may only be fired every other turn.


### Pistol

A pistol is a small, simple Blackpowder weapon fired by a spring
mechanism. Most pistols are expensive, unreliable, and poorly
constructed.
Range: 6"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Prepare Shot, Save Modifier, Hand-to-Hand
Special Rules
Prepare Shot: A pistol takes a whole turn to reload, so you
may only fire every other turn. If you have a brace of pistols
(i.e., two) you may fire every turn.
Save Modifier: Pistols are even better at penetrating armor
than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A model wounded by
a pistol must take its armor save with a -2 modifier.
Hand-to-Hand: Pistols can be used in hand-to-hand combat
as well as for shooting. A model armed with a pistol and
another close combat weapon gains +1 Attack, which is
resolved at Strength 4 with a -2 save modifier. This bonus
attack can be used only once per combat. If you are firing a
brace of pistols, your model can fight with 2 Attacks in the
first turn of close combat. These attacks are resolved with a
model’s Weapon Skill like any normal close combat attack
and likewise may be parried. Successful hits are resolved at
Strength 4 and with a -2 save modifier, regardless of the
firer’s Strength.

### Repeater Handgun

The next step in the evolution of multi-barrelled weapons, a
Repeater Handgun mounts a number of handgun barrels around a
rotating cylinder, each one firing in turn. Prone to misfiring or
other malfunction, Repeater Handguns are still highly sought after
items, as they will launch a veritable storm of lead at the enemy if
they don’t break down.
Range: 24"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Fire Thrice, Move or Fire,
Save Modifier, Slow Reload,
Special Rules
Experimental: The Repeater Handgun is always subject to
the optional Blackpowder Weapons rules from the Mordheim
rulebook, even if they are not normally used in your
campaign. On any result other than “BOOM!” the weapon
has jammed or run out of loaded barrels and must be
reloaded.
Fire Thrice: The Repeater Handgun may fire up to three
shots; if more than one shot is made the to hit roll is at -1.
Resolve each shot individually, you may choose to shot later
shots at a different target, but they must be within 3" of the
previous target. Ordinary targeting restrictions apply to shots
as per Mordheim rulebook.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Repeater
Handgun in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.
Save Modifier: Repeater Handguns are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Repeater Handgun must take its armor
save with a -2 modifier.
Slow Reload: To reload a Repeater Handgun takes a long
time and a bit of focus. The warrior must do nothing (no
moving, no shooting, no fighting in close combat, etc.) for a
complete turn in order to reload the weapon.

### Repeater Pistol

It wasn't long after the invention of the repeater handgun that the
same principle was being used on pistols. Still prone to misfiring or
other malfunction, they have found a place in gunnery bands
armories. Stories of calm instructors gunning down hordes of foes
within feet of themselves are legendary and in all likelihood untrue.
But it just could happen....
Range: 6"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Experimental, Fire Thrice, Move or Fire,
Not a Club, Quick Reload, Save Modifier,
Special Rules
Experimental: The Repeater Pistol is always subject to the
optional Blackpowder Weapons rules from the Mordheim
rulebook, even if they are not normally used in your
campaign. On any result other than “BOOM!” the weapon
has jammed or run out of loaded barrels and must be
reloaded.
Fire Thrice: The Repeater Pistol may fire up to three shots;
if more than one shot is made the to hit roll is at - 1. Resolve
each shot individually, you may choose to shot later shots at a
different target, but they must be within 3" of the previous
target. Ordinary targeting restrictions apply to shots as per
Mordheim rulebook.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Repeater Pistol
in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your
target or stand up from knocked down.
Not a Club: The Repeater Pistol may be used as a normal
pistol in the first round of combat. After that it doesn't count
as an additional hand weapon as it is far too delicate to risk in
such a crude fashion. Its owner will not willingly discard it in
a fight and so must fight on without the use of an additional
hand weapon.
Quick Reload: The basic design of the pistol and number of
barrels allows quick reloading, the pistol will always be able
to fire at least one shot. After shooting more than one shot in
a single turn the model must spend a complete shooting phase
without shooting and without being in combat, before firing
multiple shots (see Fire Thrice, above) may be taken again.
Save Modifier: Repeater Pistols are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A
model wounded by a Repeater Pistol must take its armor
save with a -2 modifier.
### Rifle

Range: 36"
Strength: 4
Special Rule: Move or Fire, Prepare Shot, Save Modifier,
SPECIAL RULE
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Rifle in the
same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target
or stand up from knocked down.
Prepare Shot: A rifle takes a whole turn to reload, so you
may only fire every other turn.
Save Modifier: Rifles are even better at penetrating armor
than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A model wounded by
a rifle must take its armor save with a -2 modifier.



### Small Cannon

While the cannon can slow the warband down somewhat, it is
extremely useful against the larger creatures inhabiting the City of
the Damned.
Profile M WS BS S T W I A Ld

Small Cannon * - - - 5 3 - - -

Range: 8" - 36"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Hard to Fire, Large Target, Movement,
Save Modifier
Special Rules
Hard to Fire: Firing a Small Cannon requires a good crew, a
maintained weapon, and technical knowledge. The Small
Cannon can fire once every other turn with one crewman, and
each turn with two. All of the normal shooting rules apply,
but no Shooting skills apply to the Small Cannon. The
cannon may not move and fire in the same turn.
Large Target: Small Cannon is still an obvious target even
from far away, and can always be targeted by enemy
shooting.
Movement: Even the Small Cannon require a good crew to
move it. A single crewmember can move the Small Cannon
at haft his movement, two crewmembers can move it at their
full movement.
Save Modifier: Small Cannon are even better at penetrating
armor than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior wounded by
a Small Cannon must make his armor save with a -3
modifier.
[Thanks to Josh Alexander for the idea].

### Warpfire Thrower

The Warpfire thrower has an awesome potential to sends a jet of
liquid warpstone napalm that ignites in a searing magical flaming
conflagration. Since its magic is supported by mechanical means,
the net result is a blast more powerful than either could achieve
alone.
[Skaven, Clan Skryre Only]
Range: Special Attack (see below)
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Cumbersome, Heavy, Move or Fire, Pick
Target, Save Modifier, Special Attack,
Misfire
Special Rules
Cumbersome: Because the Warpfire Thrower is so heavy, a
model equipped with one may use no other weapons or
equipment.
Heavy: The Warpfire Thrower is a large heavy weapon and
at some times needed two to carry it. If used by only one then
the shooter has a -2 to movement, a -1 to Weapon Skill and
cannot charge. If the shooter(s) have to flee then they would
drop the Warpfire Thrower. The Warpfire Thrower counts as
being lost.
If the user has an Assistant, then there is only a -1 to
movement and Weapon Skill penalty.
Move or Fire: You may not move and fire a Warpfire
Thrower in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to
face your target or stand up from knocked down.

Pick Target: A model armed with a Warpfire Thrower can
target any enemy model in sight, not just the closest one.
Save Modifier: Warpfire Thrower are even better at
penetrating armor than their Strength 5 suggests. A warrior
wounded by a Warpfire Thrower must make his armor save
with a -2 modifier.
Special Attack: The Warpfire Thrower dose not fire like
other weapons been a volatile mixture of warpstone dust, oil,
& alcohol; firstly choose a target, place the Small Flame
Template at the base on the model towards the target, then
roll the Artillery Dice and moving the Small Flame Template
by the result (in inches) towards the Target. The Target and
any other model which the Small Flame Template passes
over is hit automatic and causing D3 Wounds.
Misfire: The Warpfire Thrower is always subject to the
optional Blackpowder Weapons rules, even if they are not
normally used in your campaign. On any result other than
“BOOM!” replace with the following:
Fireball: The Warpfire Thrower explodes into a
conflagration of bright green flames, the Weapon, User
(& Assistant) are destroyed, and any model within 2” of
the User, suffer a Strength 5 hit, causing D3 wound.
### Warplock Pistol

Warplock pistols are terrifying weapons, testimony to the mad
genius of Clan Skryre engineers. Warplock pistols shoot ammunition
made of magically treated warpstone and wounds caused by
Warplock pistols are horrible to behold and often cause infections.
[Skaven Only]
Range: 8"
Strength: 5
Special Rule: Save -3, Fire Every Other Turn
Special Rules
Save -3: Victim suffers -3 to their Save roll.
Fire Every Other Turn: May be fired once every other turn.
Braces may be fired once every turn, or twice every other
turn.

## Blackpowder Weapons Upgrades

### Bayonet

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user
Special Rule: Attachment, Strike First, Two-handed
Special Rules
Attachment: The Bayonet must be attached to a Handgun,
Rifle or Hunting Rifle. The weapon mounted with a Bayonet
acts like a Spear in close combat, but all Shooting attacks
have a -1 to hit while the Bayonet is attached. The weapon
can’t fire for the turn the Bayonet in attached.
Strike First: A warrior armed with a Bayonet strikes first in
the first turn of hand-to-hand combat.
Two-handed: A Bayonet requires two hands to be used and
the wielder cannot use a shield, buckler or additional weapon
in close combat.

### Double-barrelled

Knowing Ostlanders’ penchant for impressive weaponry (and ready
willingness to spend excessive amounts of money) a Weaponsmith
from Hochland decided to weld two barrels together on a pistol and
sell it for twice the price. The Warband was so impressed with their
new weapon that they asked him to do the same to their hunting
rifle. Since then the Weaponsmith has been flooded with orders from
some of the most powerful Warbands in Mordheim.
Special Rules
A double-barrelled weapon is a tricky piece of engineering,
but it’s a wonderful piece for combat. When firing such a
weapon, the bearer must declare whether he is firing one or
both barrels. If firing a single barrel, treat the shot as you
would a normal weapon. However when firing both barrels,
the method changes slightly:
To hit: Roll a single dice as you would normally. This allows
for a narrow field of fire emanating from the weapon.
To wound: Roll for each shot individually, as each shot can
wound on its own. Treat each shot that inflicts Critical Hits
separately.
Reloading: After firing both barrels, place 2 tokens on the
model. In your next shooting phase remove 1 token to
represent one barrel having been reloaded. Token removal
should be the last thing done in your shooting phase and you
cannot shoot in the same phase as your reload.
Firing a Brace: If you fire both guns and barrels at the same
time, place 4 tokens down, 2 each of different colours (one
for each pistol in the brace). Remove one token of each
colour every turn.
Used On: This upgrade can only be used on Pistols, Duelling
Pistols, Handguns, Hochland long rifles, & Nuln Shotgun.

### Heavier Ammunition

Heavier Ammunition is a special round; it may use Nickel or some
other heaver metal for the shot.
Heavier Ammunition increases the strength of one rifle shot
by 1. Heavy shot may only be used once.
### Modified Gunsight

Gunsmiths are known for their innovative approach to battlefield
invention. A modified gunsight is simply the sight from a Hochland
Long rifle that has been altered to fit a standard handgun.
The result is a longer effective range due to the better aim. A
Modified Gunsight increases the maximum range of a
handgun to 30”. Note that this does not increase the
handgun’s short range, and that shooting at targets further
than 12” away will be subject to the usual –1 modifier.
### Silver Bullets

Silver has always been rumoured to be the bane of evil creatures.
Gunsmiths are able to cast ammunition from silver, for use in any
black powder weapons (other than Blunderbuss or Nuln shotgun).
Firearms using silver bullets gain a +1 bonus to wound
undead and Possessed, Silver Bullets can be loaded into one
black powder weapon, and last for a single game.
### Superior Blackpowder

The model has acquired a better quality of blackpowder than
is normally available. This new batch adds +1 Strength to all
blackpowder weapons that the model has. There is enough
superior blackpowder to last for one game.


## Armor & Clothing

When fighting in close combat, a good suit of armor may mean the difference between life and death. The finest armor
in the known world is made in Dwarf forges, where the secrets of steel and fire are well understood. Hardened leather
jackets are often worn by the hunters of Osterland, while city soldiers prefer mail coats and steel breastplates. The forges of
the Empire have many skilled smiths capable of forging fine armor, for the humans learned this craft from Dwarf master
smiths in the early days of the Empire.
In Mordheim, only the most wealthy and powerful are able to afford the luxury of owning a suit of armor (the less well-off
have to make do with leather tunics and occasionally helmets and wooden shields). The richest leaders of the most
successful warbands wear suits of high quality armor and a good suit of armor is just as much a symbol of wealth and
power as it is protection against weapons.

### Barding

Barding is armor for a horse in the same way that light and heavy
armor is for a human. It covers the mount’s hide and in some cases
the head.
[Warhorses Only]
Special Rules
A model mounted on barded horse receives an additional +1
Armor save (+2 instead of +1 for being mounted). In
addition, a mount wearing barding will only be killed on a D6
roll of a 1 if the model is taken out of action.

### Bracers

Special Rules
Wearer may Parry. Does not occupy users hands. May be
used in conjunction with weapons that allow to parry but not
Bucklers or Shields.

### Buckler

Bucklers are small, round shields designed for parrying or
deflecting blows. They are usually made of steel for they need to be
tremendously durable to survive the brutal blows of hand-to-hand
combat. Using a buckler requires great skill, but a nimble warrior
can protect himself from blows which would otherwise cripple him.
Special Rules
Parry: A model equipped with a buckler may parry the first
blow in each round of hand-to-hand combat. When his
opponent scores a hit, a model with a buckler may roll 1D6.
If the score is greater than the highest to hit score of his
opponent, the model has parried the blow, and that attack is
discarded. A model may not parry attacks made with double
or more its own Strength – they are simply too powerful to be
stopped.

### Cathayan Silk Clothes

Some rich warband leaders like to flaunt their wealth and purchase
clothes made out of silk from distant Cathay. This silk is the most
expensive fabric in the known world, and wearing such clothes is a
sure way to attract attention – especially thieves and assassins!
Any Mercenary warband whose leader is wearing silk clothes
may re-roll the first failed Rout test. However, after each
battle in which the leader is taken out of action, roll a D6. On
a roll of 1-3 the clothes are ruined and must be discarded.

### Cold Metal Armor

Wood Elves do not use forges; they have a special smithing style
known by outsides as “Cold Forging”. Cold Forging is a mix of
both physical and magical techniques known only to the Wood
Elves. The Metal which comes from this Cold Forging technique is
call Cold Metal.
Special Rules
Save: Cold Metal Armor gives the wearer a 5+ basic save,
and does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
The Cold Metal Armor is so light and strong that other
armor giving the wear has more movement. Cold Metal
Armor gives the wear a -1 to hit in Close Combat.
### Dark Steel Armor

Dark Steel armor like Dark Steel Weapons are forged in the city of
Hag Graef, the Dark Crag. They are fashioned from Black steel, a
rare form of steel found deep within the mountains around the city.
Special Rules
Save: Dark Steel armor gives the wearer a 5+ basic save,
and does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
The Dark Steel Armor is stronger that other armor, Dark
Steel Armor gives the wear a -1 to wound in Close Combat.
### Elven Cloak

Made from the hair of Elven maidens and interwoven with living
tree leaves, an Elven cloak is a wonder to behold. A warrior
wearing such a cloak will blend into the shadows, making it very
difficult to shoot at them with missile weapons. Elven cloaks rarely
come up for sale, but are sometimes recovered from dead warriors
or offered by Elves as rewards to men who have served them in
some way.
A warrior aiming a missile weapon at a warrior wearing an
Elven cloak suffers -1 on his to hit roll.
Being from Ulthuan, Shadow Warriors have access to items
that are rarely seen by other races; 75 + D6x10 GC;
Availability: Rare 12


### Forest Cloak

[Outlaw Heroes and Wood Elves only]
Some Outlaws use Forest Cloaks to camouflage themselves
against being seen by their enemies. Any wearer of such a
cloak would appear to blend into the surrounding forest
making it almost impossible to be seen. So long as the wearer
is beside a tree, bush, hedge or vegetation, any enemy using
any kind of missile weapon at a warrior wearing a Forest
Cloak is at an additional -1 BS to hit (in addition to all other
modifiers). Similarly, if any spellcaster wishes to target a
magical attack against an Outlaw camouflaged in this way, he
can only do so by successfully rolling a 4+ on a D6. The only
exception to this is if the shooting warrior or the spellcaster is
already within their Initiative range in inches. Forest Cloaks
are available to Heroes at the time of their initial recruitment
without having to roll for Rarity. If you wish to subsequently
purchase this item during the Trading and Exploration stages
of the game, then you would have to roll for Rarity as
normal.

### Gromril Armor

Gromril is the rarest and strongest metal known of in the Old
World. Only a very few Dwarf smiths know the secret of forging
Gromril, and a suit of armor made from it fetches a huge price.
Special Rules
Save: Gromril armor gives the wearer a 4+ basic save, and
does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.

### Heavy Armor

Typical heavy armor is made from metal links and is called chain
mail. Forging chain mail is a laborious and time consuming
process, as the blacksmith must put together hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of metal links. This makes chain mail expensive, but this
type of armor provides excellent protection for anyone who can
afford it.
There are other types of heavy armor as well, of which the best
known are the steel breastplates and greaves worn by the foot
knights of the Templar orders.
Special Rules
Save: A warrior that is wearing heavy armor has a basic D6
saving throw of 5+.
Movement: A warrior that is armed with both heavy armor
and a shield suffers a -1 Movement penalty.

### Helmet

From the shining steel helmets of Bretonnian knights to the
leather caps of the Skaven, all sensible warriors try to protect
the most vulnerable part of their body – their head. Even the
most vain fighters still use a helmet, as it can be festooned
with plumes, horns and other decorations. Helmets come in
varying shapes and sizes, but their basic function remains the
same.
Special Rules
Avoid Stun: A model that is equipped with a helmet has a
special 4+ save on a D6 against being stunned. If the save is
made, treat the stunned result as knocked down instead. This
save is not modified by the opponent’s Strength.

### Ithilmar Armor

Ithilmar is a silvery metal which is as light as silk and stronger than
steel. Elves are experts at fashioning weapons and armor from
Ithilmar, and the Elven kingdom of Caledor is the only place in the
world where this metal can be found.
Special Rules
Save: Ithilmar armor gives the wearer a 5+ basic save, and
does not slow him down if he is also armed with a shield.
### Light Armor

Light armor encompasses a wide variety of materials from
hardened leather tunics to chain shirts forged from steel. It does not
offer complete protection against arrows or swords, but it is better
than having nothing at all. Light armor does not inhibit movement.
Special Rules
Save: A warrior who is wearing light armor has a basic D6
saving throw of 6.
### Pavise

A pavise is a huge shield commonly used by regiments of
warriors in a battle to defend themselves from the arrows of
their enemies. It is a weighty item and little use in a long
protracted combat but excellent against shooting.
Special Rules
Cover/Save: A warrior using a pavise counts as if he is in
cover against missile attacks (-1 to hit). In close combat, the
pavise counts as a shield (+1 armor save) but only if the
warrior was charged to his front. Because the pavise is so
heavy and cumbersome, the bearer moves at half pace.
### Reinforced Plate Armor

By Josh Alexander
Reinforced Plate is a new type of armor manufactured in the
Gunnery School of Nuln. It is based on an ordinary suit of Heavy
Armor, but has additional plating covering the joints and chest
plate to add resistance against firearms.
Special Rules
Save: Reinforced Plate Armor gives the wearer a 5+ armor
save. In addition, the extra plates negate Armor Piercing
ability of black powder weapons, meaning S4 black powder
weapons will only have a –1 armor save penalty.
Cumbersome: The heavy plating restricts movement and
reaction time, reducing the Initiative of the wearer by one.
When Reinforced Plate Armor is combined with a shield, it
reduces the movement of the wearer by 1”, exactly like heavy
armor.
### Sea Dragon Cloak

Dark Elf Corsairs use special cloaks fashioned from Sea Monsters
that dwell deep in the oceans depths. These cloaks are tough and
resilient and offer Dark Elves with a very good amount of
protection.
[Dark Elves Only]
Special Rules
Scales: the model wearing a Sea Dragon Cloak will gain +2
to his armor saves in close combat and a 4+ armor save
against all missiles attacks.



### Shield

There are two types of shield common to the warriors of Mordheim:
the first is made of wood, occasionally reinforced with metal plates.
This basic type of shield, although strong, does tend to splinter, but
this can sometimes save the user’s life as his enemy’s weapon can
get trapped allowing him to strike back whilst his enemy struggles to
free his weapon.
Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and
can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or
triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its
owner.
Special Rules
Save: A model with a shield has a basic save of 6 on a D6.

### Toughened Leathers

Expert leatherworkers are able to turn leather coats into armor
(after a fashion) and those with limited funds often favour these
jackets and coats as armor is very expensive. Covered with crusted
salt, alcohol and other less savoury materials, toughened leather is
hard to penetrate and offers some protection in combat.
Special Rules
Toughened leathers work exactly like light armor, giving the
wearer a 6+ Armor save, but cannot be combined with the
effects of any other armor except a helmet or buckler.
Toughened leathers cannot be sold back at the Trading Posts;
the stench alone is enough to drive away even the most

## desperate of buyers!

### Wolfcloak

In Middenheim it is still considered to be the feat of a true man to
slay a great wolf single-handed. Warriors who accomplish such a
deed will command the respect of their peers, and their cloaks will
be blessed by the High Priest of the Cult of Ulric, the god of winter,
war and wolves.
[Middenheimers Only]
Special Rules
To acquire a Wolfcloak, a Hero must pay 10 GC (to represent
the expense of travelling to Middenheim and taking part in a
hunt). In addition, the Hero must roll equal to or under his
Strength on a D6. If successful, the Hero finds and slays the
wolf and can wear its cloak as a mark of his skill and
prowess. Note that Middenheimers may buy Wolfcloaks
when starting their warband without making a test for
availability. A model wearing a Wolfcloak will gain +1 to his
armor saves against all shooting attacks.

### Miscellaneous equipment

This section covers all the strange and unusual equipment your warriors can find in the ruins or buy from the
merchants and pedlars in the settlements and villages around Mordheim.
Only Heroes may buy and carry the equipment described in this section. You may not give it to Henchmen unless the
rules specifically say so.

## Alcohol, Drugs, Poisons & Potions

The use of poison is almost universally abhorred, but in the ruthless and brutal battles fought in Mordheim, desperate warbands often resort
to the use of envenomed blades.
Poison may not be used with blackpowder weapons. When you buy a vial of poison, there is always only enough to last the duration of one
battle. You can only poison a single weapon with one vial of poison.

### Black Lotus

In the deepest forests of the Southlands grows a plant that is
extremely poisonous. It is known as Black Lotus and is much sought
after by alchemists, assassins, wizards of the Western Coast and
bored wives.
[Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests or Sisters of
Sigmar]
[Rare 7 for Skaven]
A weapon coated with the sap of the Black Lotus will wound
its target automatically if you roll a 6 to hit. Note that you can
still roll a dice for every wound inflicted in this way. If you
roll a 6, you will inflict a critical hit with that roll. If you do
not roll a 6, you will cause a normal wound. Take armor
saves as normal.

### Blessed Water

The priests of Ulric, Sigmar, Morr and Manann hold great power
over evil. Pure water from a clear fountain, blessed by one of these
priests, is said to burn things of darkness and evil.
[May not be bought by Undead]
[Common for Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar]
A vial of blessed water contains enough liquid for just one
use, and has a thrown range of twice the thrower’s Strength
in inches. Roll to hit using the model’s BS. No modifiers for
range or moving apply. Blessed water causes 1 wound on
Undead, Daemon or Possessed models automatically. There
is no armor save. Undead or Possessed models may not use
blessed water.

### Bugman’s Ale

Of all the Dwarf brewmasters, Josef Bugman is the most famous.
His ale is known throughout the Old World, and widely regarded as
the best.
A warband that drinks a barrel of Bugman’s before a battle
will be immune to fear for the whole of the battle. Elves may
not drink Bugman’s ale as they are far too delicate to cope
with its effects. There is only enough ale to supply the
warband for one battle.

### Crimson Shade

Crimson Shade is the name given by Old Worlders to the
leaves of the blood oak of Estalia. It is an extremely addictive
drug, but grants its users inhuman quickness and strength.
Effect: A model using Crimson Shade has his Initiative
increased by +D3 points, and Movement and Strength by +1
(this effect lasts for one game). Crimson Shade has no effect
on Undead such as Vampires and Zombies, or the Possessed.
Side Effects: After the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-3, the
model becomes addicted and you must try to buy him a new
batch of Crimson Shade before every battle from now on. If
you fail to buy any, he will leave your warband. On a roll of
12 the model’s Initiative is increased permanently by +1.

### Dark Venom

This is a poison extracted from Heldrakes, gigantic sea serpents that
plague the Western Ocean and the coast of Naggaroth. The slightest
wound infected by Dark Venom causes excruciating pain,
incapacitating the bravest of men.
[Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests, or Sisters
of Sigmar]
Any hit caused by a weapon coated with Dark Venom counts
as having +1 Strength, so, for example, if a warrior with
Strength 3 wielding a poisoned sword hits an opponent, he
will cause a Strength 4 hit instead. Armor saving throws are
modified to take into account the increased Strength of the
attack.
### Elven Wine

[Shadow Warriors Only, one use only]
High Elven wines are well known to be the best in the world,
and some are even rumoured to have magical qualities. A fine
Elven Wine can cast out doubt and fear and leave a general
feeling of well-being in a warrior. A Shadow Warrior
Warband that drinks Elven Wine before a battle will be
immune to Fear for the whole of the battle.
### Garlic

[May not be bought by Undead]
Garlic is a common herb grown in most gardens of the
Empire. It is said to ward off Vampires and other denizens of
the dark. A Vampire must pass a Leadership test or it will be
unable to charge a model carrying a clove of garlic. Garlic
lasts for the duration of one battle only, whether it is used or
not.
### Healing Herbs

Certain plants that grow on the banks of the River Stir have
curative properties. Herbalists collect their roots and leaves
and use them to treat the sick and wounded. A Hero with
healing herbs can use them at the beginning of any of his
recovery phases as long as he is not engaged in hand-to-hand
combat. This restores all wounds he has previously lost
during the game. Amazon Warriors are master herbalists and
may buy Healing Herbs as common items, instead of rare
items, for 35 GC.
### Healing Potion

May be used during the battle or after
● Effect - During Game: Restore 1 lost wound
● Effect - After Game: Model ignores all results on Serious
injury Chart except for Dead, Captured or Full Recovery.


### Liquor Flask

May be used in the recovery phase. If used, owner is immune
to fear until his next recovery phase. Two uses each game,
refilled for 5 gold crowns. Available to any hero who can use
equipment, doesn't work on any hero immune to poison.

### Mad Cap Mushrooms

The feared cult of Goblin Fanatics of the Worlds Edge
Mountains use these hallucinogenic mushrooms to drive
themselves into a frenzied state.
● Effect: Any warrior who takes Mad Cap Mushrooms before
a battle will be subject to frenzy. The Mad Cap Mushroom
has no effect on Undead such as Vampires and Zombies, or
the Possessed.
● Side Effect: After the battle, roll a D6. On a roll of a 1 the
model becomes permanently stupid.
● Orcs & Goblins Hordes: May consider them a common
item that cost 25 gold crowns if it includes one or more
Goblins, as they are a necessity for someone wishing to wield
a ball and chain. Fortunately for Orc warbands, Mad Cap
Mushrooms are cultivated by the Night Goblins of the
Worlds Edge Mountains, and they are much more willing to
trade these to other Goblins. A Goblin may take his
mushrooms at the start of any turn.

### Mandrake Root

The man-shaped Mandrake Root grows in the rotting swamps
of Sylvania. It is a noxious, deadly plant which is highly
addictive and slowly kills its users, but also allows them to
shrug off almost any pain.
● Effect: Mandrake Root makes a man almost oblivious to
pain. His Toughness is increased by +1 for the duration of a
battle and he treats all stunned results as knocked down
instead. Mandrake Root has no effect on Undead, such as
Vampires and Zombies, or on the Possessed.
● Side Effects: Mandrake Root is highly poisonous. At the
end of the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-3 the model loses 1
point of Toughness permanently.

### Potion of Strength

● Effect: The Potion adds +D3 to strength
● Duration: A leadership test recovery phase to see if the
Potion’s effects wear off.

### Speed Potion

On the Turn the potion is taken roll to find out what happens:
D6 Result

1 unaffected
2 - 3 M and I increase by D3
4 - 5 I and M increase by 3, but T is at -1
6 I and WS increase by D6, BS and M by D3
● Duration: Roll a D6 each recovery phase, if equal to or less
then the Toughness the effects last for another turn, when the
Potion wears off he goes down for a turn, after that treat as
normal.

### Spider’s Poison

Forest Goblins commonly jab their weapon points into the
bodies of giant spiders in hopes of coating them with deadly
poison. Once this poison is bought, it is applied to one
weapon, and may not be traded or sold later on. The weapon

in question, once poisoned, adds +1 to any injury rolls from
then on.
● Common: Forest Goblins may consider Spider’s Poison as
a common item that cost 25 gold crowns.
### Tears of Shallaya

[Not available to Possessed or Undead.]
Tears of Shallaya are vials of water from the holy spring in
Couronne. Shallaya is the goddess of healing and mercy and
it is said that this water has curative properties and is proof
against any poison. A model who drinks a vial of the Tears of
Shallaya at the beginning of a battle will be completely
immune to all poisons for the duration of combat. Undead
and Possessed warriors may not use the Tears of Shallaya.
There is enough liquid in a vial of the Tears of Shallaya to
last for the duration of one battle.
### Vial of Pestilens

This small crystal vial contains an extremely potent and rapid
disease. A single sniff is enough to melt the airways and leave the
victim drowning in its own blood. It is, however, short lived and
only remains dangerous for a few seconds before it is neutralised in
the air.
[Skaven only]
The vial may be opened and shoved in the face of the model
in base contact that just took the Skaven Out of Action. The
opponent must roll equal to or under its Toughness or
automatically be taken Out of Action, no save is allowed. If
the opponent succumbs to the disease, he didn’t manage to go
through with the attack and the Skaven is only Stunned not
Out of Action. The vial may be used once.
### Vodka

[Kislevite Heroes Only]
Kislevites live in a harsh land under constant threat of
invasion. While this has instilled a seriousness in these
people, it has not diluted their love of celebration one bit. If
anything their love of revelry has increased with the
hardships they have had to endure, as they have learned that
life is fleeting, and any excuse to enjoy what they have been
given is not to be squandered. One of the products of this
love of life and celebration is a strong alcoholic spirit called
vodka. It is also one of the country’s most famous exports,
though most inhabitants of the Old World find it too harsh for
their palates. Kislevites take such enjoyment in this drink and
regard it as something almost magical. Mothers give vodka to
their families to ward off sickness and to keep them warm in
the long winter months and warriors indulge both for luck
and courage. Outsiders often scoff at the reputed properties of
this liquor, but it must be said that a Kislevite army that is
well supplied with vodka certainly fights better and in higher
spirits than one without. In game terms, vodka is a one-use
item of equipment that a Kislevite Hero may give to the
warband before the start of the game. Every warrior in the
warband receives +1 Leadership (up to a maximum of 10) for
that game. In addition because of its nullifying alcoholic
effects every warband member must test against their
Toughness before the start of the game – a failure resulting in
-1 Initiative for the duration of the game.


## Banners

### Banner

Many more established warbands carry a banner or flag, not only to
announce their presence but to also act as a rallying point for the
warband during a battle.
A banner requires one hand to use and can be carried by any
Hero in the warband. Friendly warriors within 12" of the
banner bearer may re-roll any failed ‘All-Alone’ test; but
remember you can’t re-roll a failed re-roll.

### Clan Pestilens Banner

[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
A model within 12'' of the standard bearer of the band,
usually a Plague Monk or a Monk Initiate, may reroll once
every failed All Alone test. The staff of the Clan Pestilens
banner counts as a two-handed weapon. A warband may have
a single Clan Pestilens banner at any one time. (Clan
Pestilens members use this item instead of the normal
Banner).

### Standard of Nagarythe

[Shadow Warriors Only]
May only be purchased when the warband is created. While
many Shadow Warrior Warbands are simply wandering,
some represent groups that have been sent from Ulthuan on
some special mission for the Phoenix King. Such bands are
really closer to military units than loose bands of warriors. As
such, they tend to retain their unit insignia and other
trappings. Chief among these is the unit standard. A unit’s
colours can hold a lot of meaning, particularly when the
warriors in that unit lack a true home. A Shadow Warrior
band normally makes their standard by hand; cost and rarity
represent the difficulty of finding the proper materials (fine
silks and thread of gold, for example). A Standard of
Nagarythe can serve as a second rallying point (the Shadow
Master is the first, represented by his Leader skill) for the
unit. Any members of the Shadow Warrior Warband within
6" of their standard take all Leadership tests against a
Leadership value of 10. In addition, should the standard be
captured by the enemy (model holding the standard is Taken
Out of Action), all members of the Warband will be subject
to Frenzy for the remainder of the game, and may not
voluntarily Rout. Note that these effects (Leadership 10 and
Frenzy) do not affect any Hired Swords in the Warband, only
actual Shadow Warriors (including Shadow Warrior heroes)
are affected. A model carrying a standard requires one hand
free to do so, so no weapons, shields, etc. may be carried in
this hand, and no double-handed weapons may be used while
the standard is carried. A standard may be used in close
combat as a makeshift spear (use the rules for a spear but
with -1 on the to hit rolls.)
## Charms & Amulets

### Bear-Claw Necklace

Bears are widely regarded as sacred in Kislev, and a necklace made
of their claws (or sometimes their teeth) is considered magical and
reputed to have magical powers.
[Kislevite Heroes Only]
A warrior wearing a bear-claw necklace receives some of the
strength and wild ferocity of the bear it came from. A warrior
wearing a bear-claw necklace becomes subject to Frenzy.

### Lucky Charm

These take many shapes, but the most common are symbolic
hammers that a pious Sigmarite Priest has touched, or carved
heads of ancient Dwarf gods. The first time a model with a
lucky charm is hit in a battle they roll a D6. On a 4+ the hit is
discarded and no damage is suffered. Warbands may not contain more than one Lucky Charm.

### Rabbit's Foot

The rabbit's foot is a symbol of good luck and often worn
about the neck on a thin cord of leather by superstitious
warriors. A rabbit's foot allows the warrior wearing it to re-
roll one dice during the battle. If not used in the battle, it can
be used to re-roll one dice during the Exploration phase,
providing the hero is able to search through the ruins. Warbands may not contain more than one Rabbit's Foot.

### Red Toof Tribal Jewellery

(Greenskins Only)
Only proving one’s prowess in battle can attract the attention
of this cadre of warriors. Once inducted to the tribe, the
warrior undertakes excessive body piercing! This cannot be
removed. The model will now be subject to the rules for
Frenzy as described in the rulebook.
### Tarot Cards

[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]
Though declared blasphemous and illegal by the Grand
Theogonist, the Tarot of Stars is said to foretell the future for
those who dare to consult it.
SPECIAL RULE
A Hero with a deck of tarot cards may consult them before
each game. Make a Leadership test. If successful, the Hero
gains a favourable insight into the future and you may modify
the result of any one dice in the Exploration phase by -1/+1
(even if the Hero with the cards is taken Out Of Action). If
the Leadership test is failed by three or more (i.e., a Hero
with Ld of 8 rolls 11 or 12) the cards show a portent of doom
and despair and the Hero refuses to fight in the following
battle and must miss the next game.


### Warpstone Amulet

[Skaven Heroes Only]
The owner of a warpstone amulet may reroll a single die
during the battle or, if not out of combat at the end of the
game, a single die when looking for wyrdstone shards.

### Wyrdstone Pendulum

Pendulums made of wyrdstone can reputedly be used to find
even more of the magical stone.
Special Rules
If he was not taken out, the Hero using the Wyrdstone
Pendulum may make a Leadership test after the battle. If he is
successful, you may re-roll any one dice in the Exploration
phase.

## Magic, Books & Scrolls

### Book of the Dead

This is a book that contains transcripts from the Famous
books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer. A Model can learn
Necromantic Magic with Arcane Lore skill and this book. A
Necromancer will gain a new spell permanently.

### Dispel Scroll

This scroll contains a powerful counter-spell. It may be read
aloud immediately after an opponent has successfully cast a
spell (but before results have been determined) to negate its
effects. When used roll a D6. The enemy spell is cancelled on
a roll of 4 or more. After one use, the scroll will disintegrate
and is useless.

### Elven Runestones

[Shadow Weavers Only]
High Elven mages are well known as the masters of
defensive magic. To aid them, they have developed several
mystic runes of power. They often inscribe these runes on
semiprecious stones, which can help strengthen an Elven
Mage’s magical defences. A mage with Elven Runestones
may use them to attempt to dispel a spell that has been
successfully cast against himself or another member of his
warband. To dispel such a spell, the mage must roll against
the spell’s Difficulty (Sorcery does not help here). If he
succeeds, the spell fails to work. If the roll fails, the spell
works normally.

### Halfling Cookbook

All Halfling chefs have their own secret recipes, and these are
recorded in tomes handwritten in Mootland, the home country of the
Halflings. Food prepared according to these recipes will attract
warriors during these lean times.
The maximum number of warriors allowed in your warband
is increased by +1 (note that neither an Undead warband nor
a Carnival of Chaos warband can use this item).

### Hammer of Witches

[Witch Hunters Only]
The pages in this tome describe the servants of Chaos, witches,
heretics, deviants, mutants, warlocks, blasphemers, necromancers,
sinners and other enemies of Sigmar in all their foulness.
Special Rules

A Hero with the Hammer of Witches will hate all Possessed,
Skaven, Beastmen, Chaos, Daemons, Dark Elf, Orc &
Goblins and Sigmarite Sisters.
### Holy (Unholy) Relic

In this age of superstition and religious fanaticism, holy objects are
an important part of life. Relics abound in the Old World: hairs of
Sigmar, pieces from Ulric’s hammer, teeth of Daemon Princes, all
are sold to men needing encouragement before battle and as charms
against sorcery.
[Rare 6 for warrior-priests and Sisters of Sigmar]
A model with a holy relic will automatically pass the first
Leadership test he is required to make in the game. If worn
by the leader, it will allow him to automatically pass the first
Rout test if he has not taken any Leadership tests before.
You can only ignore the first Leadership test in any single
game – owning two or more holy relics will not allow you to
ignore second and subsequent tests.
### Holy Tome

Books of prayers and descriptions of the holy deeds of religious
heroes like Sigmar Heldenhammer are copied by hand in the
scriptoriums of Sigmar and Ulric, and given or sold to the faithful.
Of these tomes, the Deus Sigmar is the most common and well
known, but other texts such as the Scriptures of Sigmar are also sold
to those who follow the faith. A holy man can recite his prayers from
such a book, strengthening his faith and belief.
[Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar Only]
A Warrior Priest or Sister of Sigmar with a holy tome can
add +1 to the score when determining whether he (or she) can
recite a spell successfully or not.
### Liber Bubonicus

[Skaven, Clan Pestilens Only]
If a Clan Pestilens warband includes a Pestilens Sorcerer, he
may use the Liber Bubonicus to permanently learn an
additional spell randomly chosen from the Horned Rat spell
list. A Plague Priest may use the Liber Bubonicus to learn the
Horned Rat magic if he has the Magical Aptitude skill: that
means he would gain the special rule "Spellcaster: is a
spellcaster and may cast spells from the Horned Rat spell
list." and permanently learn a randomly chosen spell from the
Horned Rat spell list. The Liber Bubonicus may be used a
single time, and a warband cannot have and use more than


one Liber Bubonicus in a given campaign (Clan Pestilens
members use this item instead of the Tome of Magic).

### Liturgicus Infecticus

[Skaven, Pestilens Only]
A Clan Pestilens member, usually a Plague Monk, may carry
with him a scroll with the holy Liturgicus Infecticus inscribed
on it. This is the Clan Pestilens chant in favour of diseases
and contagion. At the beginning of a turn, or just before
taking a Route Test, the warband may chant the Liturgicus
Infecticus, and benefit of a +1 Leadership bonus until the end
of the turn. (Clan Pestilens members use this item instead of
the War horn).
### Magic Gugginz

[Greenskins Only]
These are odds and ends carried around by the Shaman to
focus his powers. Most are bat feet, lizard lips, and the like,
but still seem to provide benefits to their owner. The Shaman
may re-roll a failed magic test on a D6 roll of 4+.
● Rare: Greenskins may consider Magic Gugginz as a Rare
9.
### Mordheim Map

Some survivors of the cataclysm still remain in the many settlements
around Mordheim, and make a living by preparing maps of the city
from memory. Many of these maps are faked, and even real ones are
often crude and inaccurate.
A map can help a warband find their way through the
confusing maze of streets and into areas with rich buildings
to loot. When you buy a map, roll a D6:
1 Fake: The map is a fake, and is completely worthless.
It leads you on a fool’s errand. Your opponent may
automatically choose the next scenario you play.
2-3 Vague: Though crude, the map is generally accurate
(well... parts of it are... perhaps!). You may re-roll
any one dice during the next exploration phase if you
wish but you must accept the result of the second roll
4 Catacomb Map: The map shows a way through the
catacombs into the city. You may automatically
choose the scenario next time you fight a battle.
5 Accurate: The map is recently made and very
detailed. You may re-roll up to three dice during the
next exploration phase if you wish. You must accept
the result of the second roll.
6 Master Map: This is one of the twelve master maps
of Mordheim made for Count von Steinhardt of
Ostermark. From now on you may always re-roll one
dice when rolling on the Exploration chart as long as
the Hero who possesses this map was not taken out of
action in the battle.



### Scroll of the Rat Familiar

[Skaven Only]
The Scroll of the Rat Familiar has a spell inscribed on it,
usable by a Pestilens Sorcerer as many times as he wants. If
the warband includes at least a Giant Rat, the spell may be
cast on it before the combat begins, transforming it in a Rat
Familiar. If his Rat Familiar is within 6'', the sorcerer may
reroll once in a game the dice to overcome the difficulty of a
spell. A sorcerer may only have one Rat Familiar at any one
time, it is a henchman and it counts normally toward the
maximum number of models permitted to the warband. If the
sorcerer dies, his Rat Familiar turns back to Giant Rat form.

(Clan Pestilens members use this item instead of the normal
Familiar).
### Tome of Magic

[Not available to Witch Hunters or Sisters of Sigmar]
Sometimes books of forbidden lore are offered for sale in the
markets and dark alleys of the settlements around Mordheim.
A tome of magic may be consumed by a wizard in order to add +1 to their wizard level
and in the case of Mordheim wizards unlocks access to one lore of magic
appropriate to their closest Warhammer counterpart. A wizard may consume multiple
tomes but may not increase their wizard level above 4.

## Musical Instruments

A musician must have an instrument to play so he can sing songs, tell tales and make hideous noises.

### Drum

[Musician only]
These are barrels with a tanned hide stretched over them to make
the sound.
The mallet may be used as a club and the drum as a shield.

### Flute

[Musician only]
These are made of wood or bone.
They add +1 to your leadership roll.

### Lyre

[Musician only]
These are made of wood with strings strung to play tunes.
When using this with the minstrel skill it adds 1d6 to the gold
earned.

### War Horn

The blaring sound of a war horn can be enough to stir the
hearts of any warband which it is attempting to bolster. It
grants men courage and gives them the will to fight on
defiantly. A war horn may be sounded once per battle at the
beginning of any of the player's turn. It allows the warband to
increase its Leadership by +1. The effect will last until the
start of the next turn. The war horn can be used just before a
warband is about to take a Rout test.
### War Horn of Nagarythe

[Shadow Warriors Only]
Similar to the Standard of Nagarythe, units of Shadow
Warriors sent into Mordheim often bring with them a war
horn to rally around. The rules for the War Horn of
Nagarythe are the same as for a normal War Horn.
## Explosives

### Fire Bomb

Designed by the dwarf engineers of the Worlds Edge
Mountains, fire bombs are a rare and deadly weapon. A small
batch of gunpowder is sealed within an iron casting with a
short fuse fed into it. When lit, the thrower has only seconds
before the gunpowder ignites and explodes. This can often
prove to be dangerous, as if the fire bomb is fused incorrectly
it could be the thrower who finds himself amidst the
explosion... The fire bomb may be thrown in the Shooting
phase in the same way as blessed water (p53 Mordheim
rulebook). If the bomb lands on target, the warrior hit takes
D3 Strength 4 hits with no saves for armor and all warriors,
friend or foe, within 1” of him take 1 Strength 3 hit with
saves as normal. If the throwing warrior rolls 1 when rolling
to hit, the bomb misfires and explodes just as if the throwing
warrior had been hit by his own fire bomb.

### Flash Powder

An ancient Dwarf creation, flash powder is used in mines to
illuminate darkened fissures in the search for gold and other
precious minerals. In Mordheim, small bags of this substance
can be used to blind enemies, throwing them into disarray as
you launch your attack. Flash Powder can be thrown as and
enemy charges the wielder (as an interrupt). The charger
must take and immediate Initiative test in order to cover their
eyes. If he fails, he is temporarily blinded and it counts as a
failed charge. There is only enough flash powder for one use
during the battle.

### Smoke Bombs

When thrown these bags of powder explode with a small bang and
release a cloud of smoke that obscures vision and confuses anyone
caught within the explosion.
When a smoke bomb goes off it makes a column of smoke 2"
wide that blocks line of sight for one turn. Any model caught
in the smoke should make an Initiative test so you see if he
can move to the right direction. Otherwise use a scatter dice
(or similar) to see where he moves to. At the end of each turn
roll a D6.
Dissipation chart
D6 Result
1 The smoke hasn't changed. Leave it in place at the
same size.
2 - 5 It shrinks half it size (when it get less than a haft
inch the smoke dissipate).
6 the wind catches it and blows it away
Inside: If the smoke bomb goes off indoors (or in dwarven
tunnels, Khemri tombs, etc) there wouldn't really be much
breeze to blow it away and you would have to wait for it to
dissipate so subtract one from all rolls on the dissipation
chart.


## Other Items

### Caltrops

Original used on the battlefield to impede cavalry charges, a caltrop
is a small spiked iron ball. In the City of the Damned, a pouch of
these small items can be enough to deter any attacker who risks
serious injury should they try to charge over them.
There are enough caltrops to last for one use only. They may
be used when an opponent decides to charge. The defender
simply throws the caltrops into the path of his attacker and
they reduce his charge range by D6 inches. If this means that
the attacker cannot reach his target then it is a failed charge.

### Lantern

A model that is in possession of a lantern may add +4" to the
distance from which he is able to spot hidden enemies.

### Lock Picks

A standard piece of kit for less scrupulous characters. A set
of lock picks may be used by those who rely more on skill-at-
arms and speed of thought than brute strength to open doors
that others have secured. A model equipped with a set of lock
picks may make his test to open doors on his Initiative rather
than his Strength characteristic if he wishes. This is done at
the end of his Movement phase as if the model were ripping
the door off its hinges, though he uses his Initiative rather
than Strength, there is no -1 modifier, and there is no chance
that the door is too damaged to be locked again later.

### Net

Steel nets, such as those used by Pit Fighters, can be used in
battles. Once per game, the net may be thrown in the shooting
phase instead of the model shooting a missile weapon. Treat
the net as a missile weapon in all respects with a range of 8".
Use the model’s BS to determine whether the net hits or not –
there are no movement or range penalties. If it hits, the target
must immediately roll a D6. If the result is equal to, or lower
than his Strength, he rips the net apart. If the result is higher,
he may not move, shoot or cast spells in his next turn,
although he is not otherwise affected. In either case the net is
lost.

### Opulent Coach

Truly successful warband leaders are quite willing to waste their
money on extravagant excesses such as rare wines, jewel-encrusted
weapons and armor and Cathayan spices. The height of such
indulgence is an opulent coach, which the warband leader can use
for driving around the settlements surrounding Mordheim. There
are few things that will impress commoners, or incur the wrath and
envy of other, less successful leaders, as much as an opulent coach.
Special Rules
The opulent coach impresses even the most suspicious
merchant and they will flock to offer their most exotic wares
to the obviously rich warband leader. The warband leader
gains +3 to any rolls to locate rare items.
### Rope & Hook

A warrior using a rope & hook will find it much easier to move
amongst the ruins of Mordheim.
A warrior equipped with a rope & hook may re-roll failed
Initiative tests when climbing up and down.
### Telescope

Common to the great astronomers in the observatories at
Nuln, telescopes are a useful, if highly rare, item to have in
the City of the Damned. The keen view offered by these
instruments makes shooting easier and gives an unparalleled
awareness of a warrior's surroundings. Any Hero using a
telescope may increase the range of any missile weapon he is
using by D6” each turn. Furthermore, he triples the distance
at which he can spot hidden enemies.
### Torch

Warriors lacking the funds for a lantern may have to make do
with torches. Torches act exactly as lanterns, adding +4" to
the range the model may spot hidden enemies, but has a few
other special rules as well. A torch will only last one game. A
model armed with a torch counts as causing fear in animals
(Hunting Dogs, all riding steeds, Bears, Wolves, etc), and
may use a torch as a makeshift club. When used in combat, a
torch is treated as a normal club, though with a -1 to hit
modifier. Any models that have a Regeneration special rule
(like Trolls) will not be able to regenerate wounds caused by
a torch during the battle. (Torches may also cause buildings
to catch fire.)
