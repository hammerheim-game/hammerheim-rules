# Spells & Prayers
</div>


There have always been those who have used magic: witches and wizards, wise women and warlocks. But scholars know that all magic is dangerous, for it originates from Chaos, the source of corruption and change. Indeed, during these times, sorcery is illegal and punishable by death. 

Wizards have little say in whether the world of magic touches them. They are born with second sight and to them the world of magical energies and spells is much more real than the mundane world of normal mortals. With all the persecution, fear and hatred it is little wonder that wizards become reclusive and suspicious, and many are downright insane. Some even turn to the worship of the dark gods, and others follow the forbidden path of necromancy.

Mordheim has become home to many magic users and they roam the ruins hiding from Witch Hunters. But there are other ways of gaining power over and above that of a normal mortal man. The gods watch over their subjects and a priest of strong faith can call upon them to assist them in battle. Of these the Priests of Sigmar are the most common, for Sigmar is the patron god of the Empire and his following is strong during these times of strife.

### Allocating spells


Most wizards start with one randomly determined spell, but may gain more. Roll a D6 and consult the appropriate chart, as stated in their roster entry. If you get the same spell twice, roll again or lower the spell’s difficulty by 1. 

### Casting spells

In order to cast a spell, the caster must roll 2D6. If they equal or exceed the difficulty of the spell then the spell has succeeded! If their roll includes 2 or more 6's then the caster has cast with Irresistable force. Their spell may not be dispelled and after resolving it they must roll on the Miscast table in the Warhammer rulebook. If this is unavailable, then the Wizard instead takes D3 wounds with no Armour Saves allowed. In either case they may cast no more spells that turn.

Note that Prayers behave exactly like spells, except they do not miscast and may be used even when wearing armour.

There are several different types of spell, each behaving differently: 
 
**Hex:** Hex spells are malific enchantments that inflict some sort of negative status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any foe to be the target of a Hex as long as they are in line of sight.    

**Augment:** Augment spells are powerful enhancements that bestow some sort of positive status on the target. The caster may freely nominate any ally to be the target of an Augment as long as they are in line of sight. Note that many Augment spells only effect the caster.

**Direct Damage:** Direct Damage spells are the term used for any magic that inflicts damage but is not necessarily a projectile. This might be a snap of the fingers causing an enemy to burst into flames for instance. Direct Damage spells may freely be targeted on any enemy as long as they are within line of sight.   

**Magic Missile:** Magic Missile spells tend to be more powerful than Direct Damage spells, or easier to cast. They represent streaming bolts of fire, or lightning lances that have to trace towards their target. Magic Missiles behave in the same way as Shooting attacks in every way except that they do not need to roll to hit - they always hit automatically. As they are shooting attacks they may not be used against targets in combat or if the wizard themself is in combat.

### Wizard Levels

Most Wizards will begin a Campaign without a Wizard Level at all - these are often known as Hedge Wizards: simple arcanists who perhaps have only managed to master a single spell. They are often self-taught or come from very small communities, and most Mordheim campaigns that involve any sorts of Wizards at all will mostly involve these.

More powerful Wizards however will become far more proficient at the casting of spells, and in the spells they know how to cast. Especially powerful ones will even be able to channel the Winds of Magic in their favour, able to enhance their spells or even dispel enemy spells. Typically these Wizards will gain levels either through recruitment from the Warhammer books (see Hammerheim), or through consumption of a Tome of Magic. There are two benefits to Wizard Levels that I will cover here:

##### Better Spellcasting
For every Wizard Level, you may add +1 to your casting attempts. 

##### Better Channelling
For every Wizard Level, you gain one additional Channeling attempt.

### Channelling
At the start of each of your shooting phases your Magic Users and Prayer users may attempt to Channel by rolling a D6. On a roll of a 6 they have succeeded in channelling, and will gain a Channeling Dice! Channelling dice can be used in one of two ways, but any unspent dice are discarded at the start of your following shooting phase, when you next attempt to channel.

##### Boosting Casting Attempts
You may spend your dice by adding an additional dice to a casting attempt, allowing you to roll 3D6 instead of 2D6. You must declare whether to do this before you attempt to roll, and if any two of the three dice are 6's then you Miscast

##### Dispelling Enemy spells.
Alternatively if an enemy succeeds in casting a spell, but before resolving its effects, you may attempt to dispell it. On a 4+ the enemy spell is dispelled and nothing happens.

You may not attempt to dispell an enemy spell that has Miscast - the magic is too wild and rampant to control!

## Prayers of Sigmar
Sigmar was the first Emperor of the humans, and the one responsible for their uniting into the Empire. He ultimately disappeared at the height of his power with no explanation, and while insisting on being mortal during his life, cults began to spring up in fanatical worship. Sigmar has become a byword for all things human, holy, orderly, and pure, and the Grand Theogonist who rules the Church of Sigmar is very possibly the most influential human in the world.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | The Hammer of Sigmar | 7 | Augment | The caster's weapon is imbued with the white-hot light of Sigmar. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase they gain +1 Strength and any successful wounds (after resolving armour saves) are multipled into two wounds. |
| 2 | Hearts of Steel | 8 | Augment | Waves of glory surround the servant of Sigmar; the faithful are heartened by the warrior god’s presence. Any allied warriors within 8" of the caster become Immune to Psychology. Lasts until the caster takes a wound. |
| 3 | Soulfire | 9 | Direct Damage | Purifying white flames burst from the caster, smiting their foes but leaving allies unharmed. All enemy models within 4" of the scaster suffer a Strength 3 hit with armour saves allowed. Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead. |
| 4 | Prayer of Zealotry | 7 | Augment | The sight of injustice makes the blood boil and turns righteous souls to fury. The caster and all allies within 4" gain the Frenzy special rule until the start of the caster's next shooting phase. |
| 5 | Prayer of Vigour | 5 | Augment| The caster may target one ally within 8" including themself if they wish. The target immediately regains up to two wounds lost earlier in the battle . |
| 6 | Armour of Righteousness | 9 | Augment | Sigmar's blessings strengthen in direct proportion to one's willpower and belief, and a Priest who wholly believes that they will come to no harm will not do so. The caster gains a 4+ Ward Save that lasts until they take a wound. |

## Prayers of Shallya

Shallya is the Goddess best known for being consistently merciful and sympathetic. Priests of Shallya are beloved by all in the Empire, for their duties range from the mending of wounds to the soothing of broken hearts. She is often symbolised by a white dove, and many see the relative popularity of worship of Sigmar over Shallya as being endemic of the bloodthirsty and violent state of the world.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Regeneration | Auto | n/a |After the game the Priest may Heal a single permanent injury of any warband member. Alternatively this spell may be used in the same way as Medical Knowledge. |
| 2 | Heal | 5 | Augment | The caster may restore all lost wounds to a single ally within 12". Warriors that are _incapacitated_ immediately recover at no penalty. |
| 3 | Mass Heal | 8 | Augment | The caster may restore a single lost wound to every ally within 4". Warriors that are _incapacitated_ immediately recover at no penalty. |
| 4 | Cleanse | 6 | Augment | The caster may remove a Hex effect from an ally within 18". This will also extinguish any burning effects such as from fire arrows, or negative effects or addictions from drugs like Crimson Shade. |
| 5 | Ward Against Pain | 6 | Augment | All allies within 6" of the caster, including the caster themself, may not be stunned. Stunned models are _Knocked Down_ instead. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 6 | Shallya's Merciful Shroud | 8 | Augment | All allies within 4" of the caster, including the caster themself, gain a 5+ Ward Save. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

## Prayers of Taal

Taal is the God of Nature and demands the respect of all those who enter the wild regions of the Empire. He is portrayed as a tall, broad-shouldered man with long wild hair and a thick beard. He wears a stag skull as a helm and is clothed in bison and bear skins. He is often called the Lord of Beasts. His followers include rangers, trappers and those who live in the wilds of the Empire.

Unlike most schools of prayer Taal Priests may never wear armour.



| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Stag’s Leap | 6 | Augment | The Caster may immediately move anywhere within 9", including into base-contact with the enemy, in which case he counts as charging and gains a +1 Strength to his first round of attacks. If he engages a fleeing enemy, in the close combat phase he will score one automatic hit at +1 Strength and then his opponent will flee again (if he survives). |
| 2 | Awakening | 6 | Augment | Within every living beast, no matter how repressed, lies a wild spirit over which Taal holds guardianship. Priests of Taal can invigorate these spirits to bring a surge of natural energy into wild creatures. All friendly animals within 8" of the caster gain +1 Strength and +2 Initiative until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 3 | Bear’s Paw | 7 | Augment | A single ally within 12" of the caster, or the caster themself, gains +2 Strength until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 4 | Mated Pair | 9 | Augment | The caster gains two of any Attack Animal of their choice from the "Birds of Prey" section. At the start of each of the caster's recovery phases they must take a Leadership test. If failed, the birds disappears. Only one pair may be active at any one time. |
| 5 | Ensnarement | 8 | Hex | The caster may nominate a single enemy at ground level that they can see. A writhing mass of barbed vines and roots burst from the earth to ensnare them. In each of the target's Recovery phases they take a S4 hit and must take a Strength test. If passed they are freed and may behave as normal. If failed the Hex remains in place. |
| 6 | Summon Squirrels | 7 | Magic Missile | Taal is the master of all beasts both great and small. Those who anger him may be mauled by a mountain lion or drowned in a flood caused by an angry beaver. With this spell the Priest invokes the wrath of the Lord of Beasts, summoning forth dozens upon dozens of enraged squirrels. The furious rodents assault one enemy within 12" of the caster, crawling inside the warrior’s clothing and armour, pelting him with nuts and causing numerous tiny bites and welts. The target suffers 2D6 Strength 1 hits. No armour saves allowed. |

## Prayers of Ulric

Ulric is the patron god of Middenland, but his influence as the Great Wolf extends across the Empire. Before the rise of the Cult of Sigmar it was the worship of Ulric that was most dominant, and while the two cults would eventually reconcile with the rise of Magnus the Pious (the man who would go on to raze Mordheim to the ground), in this time period the two are fierce rivals. Priests of Ulric are typically enormously strong in stature, and are often seen wearing the pelts of great Dire Wolves that they have triumphed over as a rite of passage.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Snow Squall | 9 | Augment | Ulric extends his protection to the Wolf Priest in the form of a localized snow squall that engulfs the model. All enemy models in Hand-to-Hand combat within 4" of the caster are at -1 to hit due to the swirling snow and winds. The spell lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 2 | Hammerschlag | 10 | Direct Damage | The Wolf Priest calls down a hammer blow from Ulric on any enemy within 6". That model suffers a S7 attack from an enormous ethereal hammer, including the concussion special rule. |
| 3 | Bloodlust | 8 | Augment | The caster infuses themselves with a predatory rage, attacking with a fury that puts a Norscan to shame. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase they gain +1 Strength and will critical hit on a To Wound roll of a 5-6. |
| 4 | Run With The Pack | 8 | Augment | All Allies within 4" of the caster, including the caster themself, may make an additional free move - including a charge if they wish. |
| 5 | Ulric's Howl | 10 | Augment.| The Wolf Priest’s prayer is answered as an ear-shattering inhuman howl roars from their throat. For the duration of the battle, all members of the priest's warband become Immune to Psychology. | 
| 6 | Call of Ulric | 10 | Augment | The Wolf Priest lets out a cry of agony as their body re-shapes itself into that of a huge, slavering wolfkin creature. The caster gains +2 Movement, +1 Strength, and +2 Attacks but loses the effects of any equipment they were carrying. At the start of each of the caster's recovery phases they may choose to attempt to revert to their human form by taking a Leadership test. They may not use their Leader's leadership for this test, or re-roll their attempt because of a banner. If they are still in their Wolfkin form at the end of the battle they make make one final attempt to revert their condition. If failed their status changes become permanent and they become a Henchman in your warband. They lose all skills and experience they once had, may never gain experience, and any equipment they may have once had is lost.

## Funerary Rites

Morr is the god of death among humans, though rather than be the antithesis of life Morr serves as a guardian of the dead. Prayers to Morr are typically made to ensure safe passage to the soul of a lost loved one, and to preserve them lest they  arise as an Undead later on. As such Morr is best known for his opposition of all things necromantic, and while Priests of Morr are typically sullen, quiet, and dreamful people they are known too for their unrivalled ability to reclaim trapped souls from undead bondage.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Morr's Protection | 6 | Augment | While Morr Priests typicaly revile the prospect of a middle ground between life and death, Priests may (albeit briefly) phase into the world of spirits. A single ally, or the Priest, within 8" gains the Ethereal special rule until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 2 | Death Holds No Fear | Auto | n/a |Priests of Morr must be steadfast in their resolution and as such must, above all else, have no fear of death. Warbands that recruit them find this attitude rubbing off on them, and with time the chill grasp of death begins to feel more like a reassuring hearth welcoming them whenever their time comes. So long as the Priest knows this spell and remains in the warband, the entire warband is immune to Fear and Terror tests. |
| 3 | Mortality | 7 | Augment | Death is the universal fear, and with a prayer the Priest may envelop themselves in a chilling shroud that draws up over their head like a hood. To peer under it is to percieve the unknowable truth of the abyssal nothingness of the afterlife. Mortality may only be cast on the Priest and grants them the Terror special rule. Lasts until the Priest takes a wound.|
| 4 | Reclamation | 6 | Direct Damage | Reclamation targets one foe in base contact with the caster. Undead targets must take an immediate Leadership test - if passed all is well. If failed, then for every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. Non-Undead targets are mildly confused about what this gaunt stranger is doing but suffer no other effects. If no undead warbands are present in the campaign this spell may be re-rolled. |
| 5 | Services Unto Morr | Auto | n/a | No corpse is safe in Mordheim, even the burnt or buried. A Priest of Morr will safeguard the souls of the departed to ensure they are not abused by foul sorcery, and such dilligent work in service of their god earns them favour. The Priest gains +1 experience whenever an ally is permanently killed, and their warband gains +20 GC (excluding mounts).|
| 6 | Slip Away | 7 | Direct Damage | Priests of Morr are in the business of preserving the sanctity of death rather than the taking of life, and yet many Warriors dying agonizing deaths have been allowed mercy at the hands of a Priest of Morr who expedites the process. This magic does however have... practical uses. Slip Away targets a single enemy within 12" of the caster. For every wound the target is missing they take an additional wound with no armour saves allowed.|

## Prayers of Ranald

Ranald, known by many names such as the Night Prowler, the God of Thieves or even the Trickster God, is the Human God of Luck, Fortune and Mischief. His is a curious cult for it lacks the trappings, the pomp and majesty, even the structure of other cults. His priests are thieves, tricksters, and gamblers, rather than the educated effete elite so favoured by others. His temples are the gaming halls, the brothels, the taverns, and other dens of iniquity, not guilded structures of gold and marble. Indeed Ranald and his priests are unlike any others, a fact that is both distressing and delightful.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Thief's speed | 7 | Augment | Until the start of the caster's next magic phase their Movement value is increased by 3. |
| 2 | Fool's Gold | 7 | Hex | With a brief mutter a pile of gold appears on the pavements, luring the unresisting to it. Nominate a spot within 12" of the caster. All unengaged enemy warband members within 6" of the target area must take a Leadership test. If failed then in their movement phase they will walk D6" towards the target, ending their movement (though they may still shoot as normal). This has no effect on Warriors who are Immune to Psychology, or on animals. |
| 3 | Lucky Guess | 7 | Hex | The Priest calls out a potentially scathing made-up insult at any enemy whose detection range (usually twice their initiative value) the Priest would be within. The target will gain the Frenzy special rule and Hates the Priest until the end of the battle. | 
| 4 | Whoops! | 4 | Hex| Whoops! targets a single enemy warrior within 24". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target treats all terrain as Dangerous Terrain. What horrible luck that they should happen to step on that one loose ladder rung, put their foot through that one rotted plank, or that a falling roofslate would happen to land exactly on their head. |
| 5 | What Fortune! | 11 | Augment | Ranald smiles on fools and gamblers, but Priests that ask for direct wealth rarely meet with fortune. Or perhaps knowing that makes this all the riskier? If successfully cast the Priest immediately comes into posession of a Wyrdstone Shard. |
| 6 | Black Cat | 6 | Direct Damage | The caster may cast Black Cat on every enemy in base contact. As if from nowhere a small feral cat the caster just happened to have befriended earlier leaps from behind the Priest and directly onto the face of their assailants in a flurry of angry claws and fur, inflicting D6 S3 automatic hits on each enemy. Once resolved, the caster may disengage freely from combat D6" in any direction. If the spell fails to cast the cat does still appear, but simply watches in disinterest. |

## Norse Runes

Norscan Shamans are an ecclectic bunch. With so many Norscan tribes shifting more towards the Hound, Serpent, Crow, and Eagle there are few practitioners left who keep to their more ancient and less corrupt traditions. As a result Shamans tend to be dour and conservative mystics, and the tribes they belong to view them with a quiet reverence.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Howl of the North | 9 | Augment | Icy winds sweep before the Shaman knocking missiles from their path. The Shaman is immune to all missile fire. Roll a dice during the Shaman’s recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the winds dissipate. |
| 2 | Angvar’s Fury | 7 | Augment | The Shaman’s howls rouse the anger of the warriors around them to a fever pitch. All allied warriors within 4" of the Shaman gain a +1 to hit in hand-to-hand combat. The spell lasts till the start of the Norse players next turn. |
| 3 | Elvek’s Breath | 6 | Direct Damage | After a deep inhale the Shaman unleashes a frigid breath like that of a Frost Wyrm. Place the flame template with its narrow end at the Shaman's base. All models touched by the template must take a Toughness test or suffer a wound. They may take armour saves as normal. |
| 4 | Gift of the Fates | 7 | Augment | The Shaman calls on the three Wyrd Sisters of Norse legend for a glimpse of the future. The Shaman may adjust any one die roll by any player by +/-1 between a successful casting of this rune & their next recovery phase. A to wound roll adjusted to or from 6 will not cause a critical. |
| 5 | Kiss of Frost | 6 | Direct Damage | The Shaman covers ground of his choosing with slick ice. A single model within 12" of the Shaman must pass an Initiative test or be knocked down. |
| 6 | Ancestor's Guidance | 8 | Augment | Every tribe has a tradition of great warriors of yore, and Shamans can revivify their lessons within fellow Norscans. A single ally within 12", or the Shaman themselves, gains +2WS and +1A until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

## Fey Magic

Fey Magic taps into what the Asrai called "The Weave", an interconnected and invisible fabric that spreads across reality and binds all living things together. Few other living things are capable of understanding this network let alone tap its powers, but when the forces of Chaos go on their rampages the Asrai describe its presence as though the Weave was being torn apart. Perhaps as direct consequence, none are more militant about the protection of nature than they.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Nourish | 6 | Augment | In the caster's next magic phase, during which they could usually channel, they automatically gain 1 more channeling dice than normal. A wizard who unsuccessfully channels for example would still get 1 bonus dice to cast/dispel with. |
| 2 | Vaul's Edge | 8 | Augment | Targets a single ally within 16". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase, the target's attacks ignore armour saves. If their victims have no armour, they gain +1 To Wound. |
| 3 | Amber Spear | 10 | Magic Missile | A great golden bolt of organic matter manifests itself in the caster's hand before being hurled at the target. Amber Spear has an 18" range, S5, and Multiple Wounds (D3). |
| 4 | Bloodvines | 8 | Hex | This spell has a range of 12" and targets a single enemy. At the start of each recovery phase the target must pass a Strength test or suffer a S4 hit. The hex is removed if they pass this Strength test, and for its duration the target may not move. |
| 5 | Wild Hunt | 7 | Augment spell | Conjuring an ornate hunting horn in their hands, the caster bellows out the mighty blare of the Wild Hunt - the demigod Orion's culling. All animals (including mounts) within 8" that are not _Immune to Psychology_ must immediately test as if they were All Alone.
| 6 | Eagle’s cry | 8 | Augment Spell | The caster utters shrill, piercing cry of the legendary Great Eagle Thuarindir, inspiring their allies. All wood elves within 6” gain +1 on to hit and +1 on the critical hit table until the start of the caster's next magic phase.

## Lesser magic

Those who have not been schooled in the ways of magic can cast only relatively simple spells. Many human wizards,
lacking the tradition of sorcery and the grimoires of Necromancers and Chaos Mages, have to rely on their own natural aptitude and experimentation. Lesser Magic (or hedge magic) is used by human warlocks, though can be used by experimental researchers curious to study its effects.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Fires of U’Zhul | 7 | Magic Missile | The wizard summons a fiery ball of flames and hurls it upon their enemies. The fireball has a range of 18" and causes one Strength 4 hit. |
| 2 | Flight of Zimmeran | 7 | Augment | Calling upon the power of the winds of magic, the wizard walks on air. The wizard may immediately move anywhere within 12", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case they count as charging. If they engage a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase they will score 1 automatic hit and then their opponent will flee again (if they survive). |
| 3 | Dread of Aramar | 7 | Hex | The wizard places a sense of mind-numbing fear into the minds of their opponents. A single model within 12" of the wizard must pass a Leadership test or flee 2D6" directly away from them. If they flee, they must test at the start of each of his own movement phases and will continue to flee until they pass a test. This spell has no effect on warriors that are Immune to Psychology. |
| 4 | Silver Arrows of Arha | 7 | Augment | The wizard's ranged weapon's ammunition begins to glow with a shimmering white light, and when discharged these spread out into a wide cone of tiny needle-like shards. The next time the wizard fires a ranged weapon the target takes an additional D6 S3 hits. If the wizard is incapable of ever using a ranged weapon this spell may be re-rolled. |
| 5 | Mirror Image | 7 | Hex | Mirror Image targets any area within 24" of the caster. An illusionary version of the caster appears in that location under the caster's control. It shares the caster's movement speed but has a 1 in every other stat. It may not attack enemies, may not gather treasure, and any hit against it will immediately cause it to disappear and award no experience. |
| 6 | Sword of Rezhebel | 9 | Augment | The wizard's weapon (or weapons) transmute into a single blazing longsword, granting the wizard +1 Attack, +2 Strength, and +2 Weapon Skill. Take a Leadership test at the beginning of each of the wizard’s own turns. If the test fails, the sword disappears. |

## Dark Elf Magic

The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High Elves specialise in the more subtle manipulations of a battlefield, the Dark Elves prefer the use of overwhelming power. Their spells are difficult to maintain but highly destructive.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Doombolt | 9 | Magic Missile | Whispering an ancient incantation the Sorceress conjures a bolt of pure dark energy and unleashes it from her outstretched hand. Doombolt has an 18" range and causes a Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 6" is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per spellcast. |
| 2 | Word of Pain | 9 | Hex | The Sorceress calls the curse of the Witch King down on her enemy, reducing their willingness to fight. The spell may be cast at an enemy model within 12". The victim must re-roll all successful to hit and to wound rolls. Lasts until the beginning of the next Dark Elf turn. |
| 3 | Soul Stealer | 9 | Direct Damage | Soul Stealer may be cast on a single enemy in base contact, inflicting a single wound with no saves of any kind allowed. The Sorceress feeds on this life-force and adds one wound to her profile, potentially taking her above her starting maximum. This bonus disappears after the battle. |
| 4 | Bittershard | 9 | Hex | The caster may target a single enemy within 12". A dense and jagged sensation emerges within the pit of their stomach as black crystals begin to sprout beneath their skin, agonizingly growing and spreading outwards. For the rest of the battle the victim takes a single S2 hit in each of their recovery phases. This effect does not stack if cast again at the same target. |
| 5 | Deathspasm | 10 | Direct Damage | The Sorceress channels Dark Magic into her enemy, causing them to writhe in excruciating pain. The Deathspasm has a range of 6" and must be cast on the closest enemy model. The affected model must roll on the injury chart. |
| 6 | Witch Flight | 7 | Augment | The Sorceress bends the winds of magic to her will and flies through the air. The Sorceress may immediately move anywhere within 12", and may count as charging. If she engages a fleeing enemy in the close combat phase she will score 1 automatic hit and then the opponent will flee again. |

## High Magic

Wizards in High Elf society are held in the absolute highest of regard, and it was through their actions that the Great Vortex is maintained and the annihilation of the world kept at bay. Asur scholars endeavour to perfect the mastery of sorcerous arts, and are expected to be proficient in all of the eight lores of greater magic before their schooling may even begin. High Magic is magic in its purest and most orderly form, an entire spectrum of possibility to those who master it.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Amethyst Blight | 9 | Hex | Drawing upon the Lore of Death, the caster inflicts a crippling curse to their foe, a blight that causes their skin to rapidly liquefy into a deathly grey gunk. Targets a single warrior within 18". The target suffers -1 Strength and -1 Toughness until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 2 | Phantasmal Murk | 7 | Hex | Mastery of the Lore of Shadows allows the caster to inflict a beguiling haze upon a foe's consciousness, making even the most mundane thoughts impossibly complex.Targets a single warrior within 18". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase, the target must treat all models as _Hidden_ for the purposes of charging, shooting, and casting spells. |
| 3 | Time Warp | 8 | Augment | The manipulation of the flow of time comes naturally to the Asur. It may be sped or slowed - but it is ever forward. Targets a single ally within 24". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target gains +2M, +2WS, and +1A. | 
| 4 | Celestial Blast | 7 | Direct Damage| Power in its most unrestricted form, a concentrated shockwave of light bursts from the caster's palms, an explosion of every conceivable colour. Place the Flame Template with its narrow end touching the caster. All models touched must pass a Toughness Test or be Knocked Down. Has no effect on _Gigantic_ or larger foes. |
| 5 | Soul Quench | 12 | Magic Missile | All creatures, even Daemons in their own way, possess the same thing - a soul. By establishing a magical tether to the soul of a foe, a wizard need but close their fist to extinguish their life force. Soul Quench targets a single warrior within 18" and deals 2D6 S4 hits. |
| 6 | Harnessed Winds | 8 | Augment | By drawing the Winds of Magic about themselves, wizards may gradually build a tempest of magic to keep them ever-empowered by its flow. All Wizards, including the caster, may treat their Wizard Level as 1 higher than normal (up to a maximum of 4) as long as they remain within 2" of the caster. Lasts until the caster fails to cast another spell, or if they take a wound. |

## Necromancy

Necromancy is the practice of reanimating the dead, typically done by binding souls to inanimate bodies. This is not always necessarily the case however, and while there are tales of vindictive necromancers binding spirits to mundane objects like chairs or candles the Tomb Kings are famous for their use of elaborate constructs to house souls.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Lifestealer | 9 | Direct Damage | The Necromancer sucks out the very essence of life from their victim, stealing its vigour for himself. You may choose a single model within 6". The target suffers a wound with no armour save allowed and the Necromancer gains an extra wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the Necromancer’s Wounds above his original maximum value. |
| 2 | Re-Animation | 5 | Augment | At the spoken command of the Necromancer, the dead rise to fight again. One Zombie that went out of action during the last hand-to-hand combat or Shooting phase immediately returns to the battle. Place the model within 6" of the Necromancer. The model cannot be placed straight into hand-to-hand combat with an enemy model. |
| 3 | Death vision | 6 | Augment | The Necromancer calls on the power of Necromancy to reveal the moment of his enemies’ death. The Necromancer causes Terror for the duration of the battle. |
| 4 | Romejo's Awakening | 8 | Direct Damage | The Necromancer whispers to the sleeping dead to rise up from the ground and seize their enemies. Choose one enemy model within 12". The model must immediately roll equal to or less than their Strength on a D6 or the dead emerging from the earth will rend him with supernatural power. If they fail, you may roll on the Injury table to see what happens to the unfortunate warrior. Has no effect on creatures Large or greater. |
| 5 | Call of Vanhel | 10 | Augment | The Necromancer summons the world of the dead to invigorate their Undead servants. All Undead allies within 6" of the Necromancer immediately make a free move - including charging. |
| 6 | Spell of Awakening | Auto | n/a | The Necromancer calls the soul of a slain Hero back to his body and enslaves him with corrupt magic. If an enemy Hero is killed (i.e., your opponent rolls 11-15 on the Serious Injury chart after the battle) then the Necromancer may raise them to fight as a Zombie in their servitude. The dead Hero retains their characteristics and all their weapons and armour but may not use any other equipment or skills. They may no longer run, count as a Henchman group on their own, and may not gain additional experience. The new Zombie follows all the normal Zombie rules (immune to poison, causes fear etc) except for retaining the Hero's profile, weapons and armour. |

## Chaos Rituals

Chaos rituals are the sorcerous acts performed by aspirant wizards who seek to earn favour with the Dark Gods. Typically these magisters are unaligned or at least have yet to discover their true calling, though they are universally insane. Nevertheless Chaos Rituals are a dark and disturbing thing to behold, bringing about violent change as often as liquefying destruction.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Revelation | 10 | Direct Damage | The caster may target a single enemy model within 6". The victim is assaulted with glimpses into the unknowable cosmic truth of Chaos, of geometrically impossible universes and shown exactly how minescule they are within that world. The affected model is immediately stunned. This spell has no effect on models that cannot gain experience, since they don't really understand what they're looking at. |
| 2 | Eye of the Gods | 7 | Augment | There is nothing that earns the favour of a Chaos God more than the keeping of a particularly brutal promise. The caster may nominate a single allied Hero within 6", including themself. If in the combat phase the Augmented Hero puts an enemy Hero _Out of Action_ they and the caster will both gain +1 experience point. |
| 3 | Dark Blood | 8 | Direct Damage | This attack uses the flame template at S5. Upon attempting to cast this spell, the sorceror slices their palm and like an erupting geyser a wash of boiling black blood gushes out to crash over their opponents. Whether their spellcast is successful or not, the caster must take an injury roll. |
| 4 | Sacrificial Lamb | 7 | Augment | By chanting blasphemous verses and slitting the throat of one who trusted them, a sorceror can elevate themselves in the eyes of their dark benefactors. To cast Sacrificial Lamb the sorceror must have a henchmen (that is not an animal or daemon) of their own warband in base contact. Upon casting the spell the henchmen is immediately killed and removed from your roster. The caster then gains +1WS, +1S, and +1A for the rest of the battle. This spell may be cast multiple times for accumulating benefit. |
| 5 | Warpstep | 9 | Augment | With a cursed utterance the fabric of reality tears just enough for the caster to slip through. The caster may immediately move anywhere within 24", including into base contact with an enemy, in which case they count as charging. Travelling however briefly through the demonic realm is extremely dangerous however, so after resolving the spell roll a D6. On a 1 a Bloodletter (see Random Happenings) has followed them through on the other side and is placed in combat with the caster as if it had charged them. |
| 6 | Soulsurge | 9 | Magic Missile | Soulsurge has a range of 18" and is Strength 5. Before rolling to wound the caster may choose to sacrifice any number of toughness points for the rest of the game. For each toughness point sacrificed in this way the attack, if it succeeds in wounding, deals an additional wound. |

## Nurgle Rituals

Nurgle Rituals are the blessings of contagion brought about from their dark master, Nurgle. It is the God of death, disease, famine, and decay - and in a world where all of those things are so very prominent it has the second largest cult following in the Empire. Wizards who utilize these gifts are often themselves particularly vile specimens, for even without their magics, simply breathing their air is enough to kill all but the most stout and hardy of people.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Daemonic Vigour | 8 | Augment | The Master imbues their minions with supernatural power. All warband members within 8" of the caster gain a 5+ Ward Save until the start of the caster's next magic phase. Daemons within this range have their Demonic Save increased from 5+ to 4+. |
| 2 | Gout | 5 | Hex | The Master bestows the gift of clubbed feet and cranky joints on their foe. Gout has a range of 18" and affects a single enemy warrior. The warrior must pass a Toughness test or lose half their Movement stat (rounding up) until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 3 | Stench of Nurgle | 7 | Direct Damage | The Master spews forth a foul, stinking mist that chokes their foes. This spell has a range of 4" and affects all living creatures except for themselves – friend or foe. Every model in range must pass a Toughness test or suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. |
| 4 | Pestilence | 8 | Direct Damage | The Master inflicts horrible diseases upon the unbelievers. All enemy models within 8" of the Master suffer a Strength 2 hit. No Armour saves are allowed. |
| 5 | Scabrous Hide | 8 | Augment | The Master’s skin becomes tough and leathery like that of their patron god. The Master gains an armour save of 2+ which replaces any normal Armour save. The Scabrous Hide lasts until the beginning of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 6 | Nurgle’s Gift | 9 | Augment | Freshly plucked from Nurgle's Garden, the Master coats their Warband's weapons with all manner of corrosive ichors. All Allies within 6" of the caster gain the Poisoned Attacks special rule until the caster's next magic phase. |

## Magic of the horned rat

This brand of sorcery is used by the Skaven of Clan Eshin. It is a sinister form of magic which calls upon the Skaven deity, a loathsome daemonic god known as the Horned Rat.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Warpfire | 8 | Magic Missile | A green flame leaps from the outstretched paw of the Sorcerer and burns its victims with indescribable agony. The spell has a range of 8", hitting the first model in its path. The spell causes D3 Strength 4 hits on its target, and one Strength 3 hit on each model within 2" of the target. |
| 2 | Skittish Planning | Auto | n/a | Having studied the portents of the Horned Rat, the Eshin Sorcerer has foreseen the battlefield and given directives to the leader, allowing him to far more effectively plan his strategies. As long as the Sorcerer is in the warband, the owning player adds +2 to their roll for determining table edges, and for first turn. |
| 3 | Gnawdoom | 8 | Direct Damage | The target is attacked by rats and soon is covered from head to foot in small, bleeding wounds. The Gnawdoom causes 2D6 Strength 2 hits on a single model within 8" of the caster. |
| 4 | Bamf | 7 | Augment | A single ally within 3" or the Wizard themselves disappears with a puff of shadowy lingering smoke. The model may immediately be repositioned to anywhere on the table within 18", though this move may not be used to enter combat with an enemy or to pick up treasure. |
| 5 | Sneek's Shadowstabs | 5 | Augment | The reality-bending and ephemeral form of Eshin's interpretation of the Horned Rat enshrouds their weapons in a dark smog, at once gaseous and solid. Targets a single ally within 12" or the Wizard himself. Until the start of the caster's next magic phase all close combat attacks and mundane missile attacks ignore all armour saves. |
| 6 | Sorcerer’s Curse | 6 | Hex | The Sorcerer points a claw towards one of his enemies and curses him in the name of the Horned One. The spell has a range of 12” and affects a single model within range. The target must re-roll any successful armour saves and to hit rolls until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

## Call of the Pack

Each of the Skaven clans has their own interpretation of the chaotic deity known as The Horned Rat. While the other Chaos Gods have distinct representations with their own personalities and vying agendas, the Horned Rat is instead a singular god whose 'truest' form is highly contested among the Skaven, and is the source of many of their internal conflicts. Clan Moulder most embrace the aspect of mutation and rapid evolution - after all, it was their incredible growth from simple rats to capable ratmen that has allowed them to become so prolific and dangerous a race.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Skitterleap | 7 | Augment | As if hurled from a metaphysical slingshot, a Fleshshaper is able to compel ones' muscles into motion. A single ally within 3" or the caster himself may make an immediate move of up to 12". This may bring them into contact with an enemy, in which case they count as charging. |
| 2 | Rat-Hulk | 9 | Augment | The first spell many Fleshshapers learn due to its endless possibilities, the caster provokes a rapid and agonizing expansion of muscle mass. Rat-Hulk targets a single ally within 8" of the caster, granting them Frenzy and +1 Strength until the end of the current turn. |
| 3 | Gnawdoom | 7 | Direct Damage | The target is attacked by rats and soon is covered from head to foot in small, bleeding wounds. The Gnawdoom causes 2D6 Strength 1 hits on a single model within 8” of the caster. |
| 4 | Exploit Mutations | 8 | Augment or Hex | Exploit Mutations targets a single model with one or more mutations, friend or foe. If cast as an Augment, the target gains +1 Strength for each mutation it has. If cast as a Hex, the target loses 1 Strength for each mutation it has. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 5 | Punitive Measures | Auto | N/a | Through brutal magics and cruel psychology, a Fleshshaper is able to turn even the most docile Clanrat into a rabid killing machine - even if only because death in combat is preferable to more time spent at camp with the sorcerer. Punitive Measures may be cast before a battle on a single ally. They gain the _Hatred (everybody)_, _Frenzy_, and _Unbreakable_ special rules.  |
| 6 | Madness | 8 | Hex | The Sorcerer causes the insane chattering of thousands of rats to fill the victim’s mind. The Sorcerer selects one enemy model within 24”. The target gains Stupidity for the rest of the battle. |

## Prayers of Corruption

Each of the Skaven clans has their own interpretation of the chaotic deity known as The Horned Rat. While the other Chaos Gods have distinct representations with their own personalities and vying agendas, the Horned Rat is instead a singular god whose 'truest' form is highly contested among the Skaven, and is the source of many of their internal conflicts. Clan Pestilens perhaps unsurprisingly most embrace the aspect of plague, the capacity of rats to carry and spread blights that are capable of killing far greater populations than military might alone.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Pox Grasp | 8 | Direct Damage | Reaching out a fetid paw saturated in the Chanter's own revolting juices, the caster attempts to lash at the nose and mouth of their opponent to share a measure of Pestilens' gifts. The Chanter selects one model in base contact. This model must pass an Initiative Test to avoid the Grasp or suffers D3 Strength 6 hits, with no armour save possible. |
| 2 | Wither | 7 | Hex | Like the sound of a clogged drain, the Chanter gargles a hateful curse that saps the vitality from their hated foes. Targets a single enemy model within 12". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target suffers -1 Toughness. |
| 3 | Pestilent Breath | 7 | Direct Damage | A wave of foul disease is coughed forth from the mouth of the faithful. The Chanter places the Breath Weapon template with the tip touching the model. Any model touched by the template takes a single Strength 4 hit on a roll of 4+. Due to the nature of this attack, no armour saves are possible. |
| 4 | Tainted Vapours | 8 | Augment | With a chattering incantation the Chanter draws clouds of noxious green smoke around the eyes and nose of an ally within 12", granting them incredible strength at great personal cost. The target gains Frenzy and +1 Strength for the rest of the battle, but in each Recovery Phase must take a Toughness test or immediately goes Out of Action.  |
| 5 | Viletide | 7 | Direct Damage | Place the large round template anywhere within 12" of the caster. A bursting eruption of plague-ridden rats scurry in all directions, vanishing from sight as quickly as they appeared as they burrow into floorboards and disappear between cracks. Every model touched by the template suffers a S1 hit. |
| 6 | Nurglitch’s Gift | 9 | Augment | With a shrill howl the Priest coats their Warband's weapons with all manner of corrosive ichors. All Allies within 6" of the caster gain the Poisoned Attacks special rule until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

## Machine Curses

The Skaven have long argued over the true nature of The Horned Rat, and new cults have come up with their own interpretations over time. Skryre however was the first clan to deviate from the ritualism of the Grey Seers, viewing their god almost solely as a resource to be exploited. To the Engineers of Skryre the contract is simple - input sacrifice, output power.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Warpfire Bolt | 8 | Magic Missile | A green bolt streaks from the outstretched paw of the Sorcerer and explodes upon impact in a shower of electrical fire. The spell has a range of 8” and causes D3 flaming Strength 4 hits on the target, and one flaming Strength 3 hit on each model within 2” of the target.
| 2 | Jolt | 9 | Direct Damage | A bright flash of intense lightling materialises between the Warlock and a foe within 12", joining between their body and his fingertips in a thunderous crash. The target must pass a Toughness test or immediately be Stunned. |
| 3 | Warp Lightning | 9 | Magic Missile | The power of the storms itself suffuses the Warlock, who unleashes the energy with devastating effects. This spell has a range of 24” and causes D3 Strength 5 hits, with no armour saves allowed. If this spell miscasts do not resolve it by rolling on the Miscast table - the wizard instead is struck by their own spell.
| 4 | Poisoned Wind | 10 | Direct Damage | The Warlock expels an acidic cloud that coats his enemies, melting them into nothing. The Warlock places the Breath Weapon template with the tip touching the model. Any model touched by the template takes D3 wounds on a roll of 5+, with no armour save possible.
| 5 | Electrical Discharge | 8 | Direct Damage | Place the small round template over the caster. All models underneath it, except the caster, suffer a wound on a dice roll equal to their armour save, with no armour saves allowed. |
| 6 | Sorcerer’s Curse | 6 | Hex | The Sorcerer points a claw towards one of his enemies and curses him in the name of the Horned One. The spell has a range of 12” and affects a single model within range. The target must re-roll any successful armour saves and to hit rolls until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |

## Waaagh! Magic

Waaagh! spells are used by Orc Shamans. They are rituals of a sort, howling prayers to the boisterous Orc gods Gork and Mork.


| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 'Ere we go! | 9 | Augment | The Shaman’s howling invigorates the ladz to fight even harder for Gork and Mork. Any Orc or Goblin within 4" of the Shaman will automatically strike first in hand-to-hand combat regardless of other circumstances. Lasts until the caster is _incapacitated_.
| 2 | Oi! Gerroff! | 7 | Direct Damage | A huge, green ectoplasmic hand pushes an enemy away. Range 8". Moves any enemy model within range D6" directly away from the Shaman. If the target collides with another model or a building, both suffer a S3 hit. 
| 3 | Zzap! | 8 | Magic Missile | A crackling green bolt of WAAAGH! energy erupts from the Shaman’s forehead to strike the skull of the closest foe. This energy easily overloads the brain of a weak-willed opponent. Range 12". Causes D3 S4 hits on the closest enemy target, with no armour saves allowed.
| 4 | WAAAAAAGH! | 8 | Direct Damage | The Shaman lets out a great bellowing roar that seems to scream with more than a single voice. WAAAAAAGH inflicts a single Strength 1 hit against a single enemy within 8". Increase the Strength by 1 for each Orc within 8" of the caster, friend or foe and including himself, who is in combat. |
| 5 | Clubba | 7 | Augment | The Shaman's current weapons are transmuted into a giant green club. The ectoplasmic club counts as a normal club with +2 Strength bonus and gives the Shaman +1 attack as well. This spell lasts until the Shaman suffers a wound.
| 6 | Fires of Gork | 8 | Magic Missile | Twin bolts of green flame shoot from the Shaman’s nose to strike the nearest enemy model. Range 12". Each of the two bolts causes D3 S3 hits; the bolts can either be fired both at the closest enemy target or split between the two closest enemy targets. |

## Nasty Magicks!
Much as the magic of the Orcs reflects their most warlike nature, the Goblins' manifestation of that same power is that of cunning, mischief, and theft. Goblin Shamans make for some of the sneakiest gitz in any warband.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Nasty Itchin' | 5 | Hex | A foul curse infests the Shaman's target, making their skin seem to crawl as if hundreds of spiders were scratching beneath the surface. Nasty Itchin' targets a single enemy within 18". Until the start of the caster's next magic phase the target's Weapon Skill and Initiative are reduced to half (rounding up). |
| 2 | Tricksy Snatchin' | 8 | Hex or Augment | Targets a single model, friend or foe, within 12". Any Treasure they were carrying is immediately placed into contact with the Shaman - they are carrying it now! |
| 3 | Big Green Barf | 8 | Magic Missile | Building up all the accumulated nastiness of his fellow Goblins, the Shaman convulses briefly before throwing his head forwards and discharging a vomited beam of pure Little Waaaagh energy. Big Green Barf targets a single enemy within 8" and hits at a Strength equal to the number of allied Goblins within 2" of the caster. |
| 4 | Stinky Bombin' | 7 | Augment | The Shaman gathers Waaaagh energy within him, building up within his diminutive frame and causing his stomach to distend horribly. In an eruption of rancid green smoke the Shaman then blasts himself to anywhere within 8". If this brings him into base contact with an enemy he counts as having performed a successful Diving Charge. |
| 5 | Oi Wassat?! | 8 | Hex | Grimgor Ironhide?! HERE?! He's not even born yet! By the time the foe realises they're victim to Goblin mischief the sneaky buggers they were fighting have scarpered. Oi Wassat?! targets a single enemy within 12". All Goblins in combat with the enemy may immediately leave combat freely, and move up to 6". Goblins moved in this way may not shoot, but may either cast spells or go into Hiding. |
| 6 | Sneaky Stabbin' | 8 | Augment | The Shaman incites within their target the profound desire to "go for da hurty bitz!". A single goblin within 8", or the caster himself, may re-roll all failed 'to hit' and 'to wound' rolls in hand-to-hand combat until the end of the current turn. |

## Shornaal Rituals
The Shornaal Rituals are used by the Seers who worship The Great Serpent. Marauders of Chaos venerate the Serpent god for its venoms, its cruelty, and its vices. Followers and victims of spellcasts alike find themselves subject to raptures of pain, pleasure, and an overwhelming of sensations mortal bodies were never meant to feel rendering them insensate. To some there is no experience like it, and they lose their minds to the depravities of Shornaal - but the majority die in excrutiating pain.

| D6 | Result | Difficulty | Type | Effect |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Delicious Suffering | 7 | Direct Damage | All models (friend and foe, except for the Seer) within 4"  must pass a Leadership test or are _knocked down_. Has no effect against models that are _Immune to Psychology_. |
| 2 | Dance of the Serpent | 8 | Augment | Enemy models that are not _Immune to Psychology_ suffer -1 to hit with all attacks at the Seer and any ally within 4" of them. Lasts until the start of the caster's next magic phase. |
| 3 | Endless Torment | 9 | Direct Damage | Choose one enemy model within 8”. From now on the model takes a wound in each of its recovery phases on a 4+ with no armour saves allowed. For the duration of the Torment the Seer cannot move or shoot, but may choose to end the spell at the beginning of any of their subsequent casting phases. If the caster is hit by an attack the spell will also immediately end. Has no effect on _Gigantic_ warriors.  | 
| 4 | Mystify | 7 | Hex | Target enemy model within 8" will have their Initiative value reduced to 1 and will always strike last in close combat, even if they charge an opponent or are armed with a spear or pike and are charged themselves. This spell lasts until the target passes a Leadership test during their recovery phase.  |
| 5 | Thousand Voices | 8 | Hex | Choose one enemy model within 12”. For the duration of the spell the model reduces i’s Leadership by D3+1 (to a minimum of 2). This spell has no effect on models that are _Immune to Psychology_. At the start of each of their recovery phases the target may attempt a Leadership test. If passed the Hex is removed. Thousand Voices can only be active on one model at a time. |
| 6 | Shornaal's Temptation | 7 | Hex | Choose one enemy model within 8” that is not immune to psychology. The model must then take a Leadership test. If the model fails, then the Seer gains control over the model. The player may attempt to regain control during their Recovery phase by taking another Leadership test. Shornaal's Temptation can only enchant one model at a time. If the Seer is hit whether by a missile or in close combat they must take an immediate Leadership test. If failed, the Hex ends.  |

## Rituals of Tchar
The Tchar Rituals are used by Seers who worship The Great Eagle. Tchar is the Lord of destiny and fate, respecting above all else the skills of wisdom and knowledge. Seers who practice these rituals are among the mightiest and most confounding of casters, for study of them is to descend spiralling into madness - as too do the victims of its magics.
