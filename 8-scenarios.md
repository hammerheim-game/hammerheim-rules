# Defend the Hoard
</div>

### Scenario: Defend the Hoard

_In this scenario the defending warband has prepared to send an accumulation of Wyrdstone back to their masters._

_Whether it be for sale in the case of Mercenaries, some bribe to win further favours for Skaven, or for returning to the chapel for cleansing in the case of the Sisters of Sigmar, Warbands will have any number of reasons to need to send resources out of the city to further their goals. The defending warband has spent a great deal of time pooling its resources and gathering wyrdstone to send away for sale, but this movement has attracted unwanted attention. Attacking warbands see an unmissable opportunity here, and must attempt to steal as much wealth as possible before the caravan (and more importantly its reinforcements) arrive._
##### Terrain
The defending player sets up a Hoard of their own design: They may choose four buildings and up to four walkways with which to build a defensible combination of structures in the middle of the table (or at least as much so is possible). In the middle of this superstructure is the Horde, a vast mountain of wyrdstone ready to be shipped as cargo. The Horde contains D3+1 shards of wyrdstone for each player participating in the scenario, and attacking players may collect a shard of wyrdstone from the Horde in the same way they would gather a normal shard of wyrdstone - collecting one per turn. As usual, animals may not gather wyrdstone. Defenders may not steal their own wyrdstone.

##### Set-up
The defending player sets up first, then attackers roll a D6 to determine who gets to deploy first, and deploy within 6" of their deployment zone. The defending warband may not form any formal alliances for this battle, and no special deployment rules may be used by any warband.
```
```
##### Starting the game

Attacking warbands roll a D6 and play then proceeds clockwise. The defending player always goes last (and therefore always gets the last play of the game)

##### Ending the game

The game lasts for 8 turns. If the defending player still has at least one warrior within the Hoard at the end of the 8th turn they then win and claim all the Wyrdstone remaining. If the defending player has no warriors remaining at the end of the game then the attackers win. 

Attackers may only keep the Wyrdstone they had in their possession at the end of the game if they did not rout, or carried off of the board. Unclaimed Wyrdstone left in the Horde or on the ground will be taken by the caravan the defenders were attempting to sell to (though they will of course recieve no credit, as it was no longer theirs to sell!). If there is only one attacker left before the eighth turn they may continue to play alone until the turn limit is reached to steal as much Wyrdstone as their warband can manage!

##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Heroes or  Henchmen carrying at least 1 shard of Wyrdstone by the end of the game get +1 Experience. Warbands that rout before the turn limit have dropped their wyrdstone, and do not gain this benefit.	
**+1 Brilliant Defence:** If the defending warband won their leader may gain an additional +1 extra Experience as the caravan owners marvel at their fantastic defiance of the odds.

# Wyrdstone Hunt
</div>

_Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of
priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon
the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the
spoils.
In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while
scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or
other such potentially rich building._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria.

##### Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone
counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are.
There will be D3+1 counters in total.
Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to
see which player goes first. The counters must be placed
more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away
from each other.

Note that counters are placed before
deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a
good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table.
Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into
contact with them, though this will end their turn. They may not perform any further movement or shooting this turn.. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table
where they fell.
```
```
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever
rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite
edge.


##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the
first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.



##### Ending the game
The game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The
routers automatically lose.
##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Any Hero or Henchman that carries any number of Wyrdstone off of the board gain +1 Experience.

# Breakthrough
</div>

_When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating,
warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However,
their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone
for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. It is recommended that this scenario is best played with three players, unless the Defender is deemed to be significantly stronger than the other participating warbands.

##### Set-Up
The Defender may choose a single table corner to be their deployment area. They may deploy their entire force within that zone in a 12" by 12" box. It is worth marking these deployment areas as they will be important to know for the Attackers' Breaking Through objective.

Attackers roll a D6 each. Highest roll deploys first on a table edge of their choosing.
```
```

##### Starting the game
The Defender goes last. Roll a D6 to determine which attacker goes first.
##### Ending the game
If the Defending player routs or if all of the Attacking players rout, then the game immediately ends.	
Each Attacking warband must calculate its rout threshold (for example, a warband of 12 has a threshold of 3.). In order for the Attacker to win the scenario they must move this number of Warriors off of either of the table edges in the 12" x 12" zone that the Defender deployed in.
##### Experience
**+1 Breaking Through:** Warriors earn +1 Experience for breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman, then the whole group gains +1 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Street Fight
</div>

_Often warbands will come face to face with each other in the
narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other
without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed._
##### Terrain
This scenario works best in groups of no more than 4 players. While certainly possible to play with more it is advised to re-roll the scenario if your games group has more than 4 players.

Set up a narrow street (approx 5" wide is best) with buildings on either side. In games with more than two players you will need to set up a junction in the middle of the board, allowing routes for each warband - a Street Fight with four players would therefore need to be a crossroad. As best you can, try to set this junction up in such a way that each warband will have about the same distance to travel if they intend on reaching the opposite board edge.

Any area that is not part of any of the buildings and is not in the street is considered _Impassable Terrain_. It will be important to establish with the other players what is or isn't _Impassable Terrain_ before rolling for deployment.


##### Set-up
Players roll a D6 each, the highest roller deploys first. Warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.

```
```
##### Special rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the
battlefield via their own edge.
##### Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
Each warband must calculate its rout threshold (for example, a warband of 12 has a threshold of 3.). In order to win the scenario a warband must move this number of Warriors off of either of the opposite table edge from the exit they deployed in. In three player games players may choose. 

This makes Formal Alliances with your adjacent neighbour particularly valuable.
##### Experience
**+1 Escaping:** Any Hero that escapes off of an opposing board edge gains +1 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Chance Encounter
</div>

_Both warbands have completed their daily search of the ruins and
are on their way back to their encampment when they run into each
other. Neither side was expecting a fight, and the warband that
reacts the quickest has the advantage._
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
Each warband is carrying D3 shards of wyrdstone at the beginning of the battle, plus 1 for each additional warband beyond the second. Mark down the number each warband has.
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.


##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative of their leader. The player with the higher score goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise.
```
```
##### Ending the game
The battle ends when only one warband is left in the game.
##### Experience
There are no additional Experience bonuses for this scenario.

### Wyrdstone
Both warbands gain all the wyrdstone they were carrying at
the beginning of the battle, minus the number of their own
Heroes that were taken out of action during the game, down
to a minimum of zero. In addition, they gain one extra shard
of wyrdstone for each enemy Hero they take out of action, up
to the maximum number of shards the opposing warband was
carrying at the beginning of the battle.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Hidden Treasure
</div>

_There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed
cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have
heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows
what they will find?_
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 

##### Special rules
All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know
roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the
buildings to find the Treasure Chest. 

Each time a warrior enters a
building which has not been previously searched by either
side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, they have found the treasure!
Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since
they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each
building may only be searched once.
If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only
one building left to search, the Treasure Chest will automatically be
found there.


Whoever recovers the Treasure Chest may roll on the following chart
after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you
roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns,
which are always automatically found. For example, roll to
see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then
roll to see if you find the armour, and so on. This can make
the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also
mean that your warband has risked death for only five gold
crowns!


| Item | Roll Required |
| :- | :-: |
| 5D6 GC | Automatic |
| Magical Artefact | 5+ |
| D3 pieces of wyrdstone | 5+ |
| Suit of heavy armour | 4+ |
| Sword | 3+ |
| D3 gems worth 10 GC each |  5+ |

```
```
##### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. Their opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

##### Starting the game
Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.
##### Ending the game
When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband
fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then
gains the treasure chest.
##### Experience
	
**+2 For Finding the Chest:** If a Hero finds the treasure chest
they earn +2 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Occupy
</div>

_This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings
are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and
holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich
pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the
tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest
to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the
next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of
your standing models is inside and no enemy models are
inside the building.
##### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. Their opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. 
```
```
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests – as the game lasts for a maximum of eight turns. If a warband voluntarily routs they lose all occupation of buildings. If all warbands but one rout before the eight turn time limit the remaining warband is considered to have occupied all buildings.
##### Experience
**+1 Occupation:** Warbands may allocate +1 Experience to their warband leader for each building they Occupy at the end of the game.

# The Rescue
</div>

There are times when your most experienced Heroes are slain, and you mourn them greatly; however, it is often worse for them to be captured by the enemy, as not only will it be likely that you cannot
get them back, but your enemy will also greatly profit from it. 

This is the scenario that warbands will play if they fail to organize the return of a Captured warband member. If such a situation arises, the warband that had a Hero captured may opt to play the next scenario as a Rescue Mission; this cannot be superseded by anything, nor can the warband who captured the Hero deny the Rescue Mission. 

##### Terrain
This scenario takes place in the Defending player's base. This can be
their headquarters within Mordheim or simply the few ruined buildings
that they have chosen to sleep in for the night. In any case the 
Defending player is the one who captured the warband member in
question. 

They may set up the map as they please, with a central 
building (or building superplex) in the middle of the board.

### The Prisoner
The prisoner and their gear are set up in the central building as
described above. The prisoner may not act until they are freed.

The defender is not allowed to attack or “execute” their prisoner, but must attempt to drive off the rescuers. Once the
captive is freed, however, they are fair game.

A prisoner is free to move and fight once cut free by a friendly fighter. The friend moves into base contact with them and spends the rest of the turn cutting them free; the rescuer may not shoot, cast spells, and fight in hand-to-hand or anything else at all.

Once freed, the prisoner may move and attack normally. Note that the captive has no weapons or other equipment until they reclaims their own (or if the friendly fighter gives them something). The attacking warband can reclaim the captive's gear by moving into base contact with the chest. As above, it takes the
rest of an attacker's turn to open the chest.

If the model who opens the
chest later comes in contact with the prisoner, they may give
the prisoner all of their old gear and re-mount if they had one.

##### Set-Up
The warband that captured the Hero is automatically the
defender, and sets up their warband anywhere on the table, though
no warrior may be within 12" of a table edge and no warrior may
be within 6" of another warrior. This must be done before 
rolling for table edges.
##### Starting the game
The Rescuer always gets the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise with the Defender going last.
```
```
### The Captors
**Sentries:** Until the alarm is sounded (see below), the
defender's models are moving about in a somewhat random
pattern, keeping a look out. Each sentry moves d6-3 inches
per turn; roll separately for each model. 

If the result is negative the sentry does not move. After moving each sentry, roll the Scatter dice and turn the model to face the direction indicated. Models with Stupidity move like this until the alarm is sounded (effectively ignoring their Stupidity for now).	
**Sounding the alarm:** Until the alarm is sounded, sentries
move as described above. Sentries that have not been alerted are at Weapon Skill 0 and they may not shoot or
cast spells. After the alarm is sounded, the sentries may move
and attack freely. The alarm can be sounded in a number of ways:	
**Spotting:** Roll 2d6 at the end of each of the defender's turns. This, plus
an individual model's detection range, is the distance at which a model can try to spot the enemy. They must be within the front 90° arc of the model. This represents that the swirling fog and lingering smoke that fills Mordheim is somewhat distracting when an enemy does not clearly present itself; as well, it shows that the attacker is attempting to move more stealthily than normal.	
_Attackers in the open will be spotted on a d6 roll of 2+._	
_Attackers in cover will be spotted on a d6 roll of 4+._	
_Attackers out of sight of a sentry or not in their frontal arc, but within the detection range of the sentry will be “spotted” (more like heard) on a roll of 6._	
_Attackers are immediately spotted if they move into Open Ground within sight of a Sentry_.

If a sentry spots a raider, they sound the alarm. However, they can only give the alarm if they survive the attacker's turn. If they are taken Out of Action, then they cannot sound the alarm.	
**Black Powder Weapons:** Perhaps unsurprisingly, if a Black Powder weapon is fired the alarm is immediately raised.	


##### Ending the game
The game ends if the captive is freed and makes their escape by moving off any table edge. The game also ends if all the
attackers are taken Out of Action. Due to the high tension and stress of the situation the Rescuer does not need to take rout tests (other participating attacking warbands still do however).

If the captive is cut free and then their warband routs before they can flee the table then they must roll for serious injury on the first half of the table. This reflects the odds of a lone and unarmed warrior exhausted by captivity having an extremely low chance of getting back home safely by themselves.

##### Experience

**+2 Escapes:** The captured model gains +2 Experience if they successfully exit the board.	
**+2 Winning Leader (Defender):** The leader of the defending
warband gains +2 Experience if victorious rather than the usual 1.

# Harpy Hunting Grounds
</div>

_The ruined buildings of Mordheim are home to many strange and
fantastical creatures, a number of which are the subjects of rumours
about hidden riches. Occasionally warbands will attempt to
discover whether these rumours are true. Most of the time these
adventurers are never seen again, but often enough they return
laden with treasures; often enough, that is, to convince the rest that
it’s worth a try..._

_A group of three Harpies have nested in one of the tall buildings in
the edge of the ruined city, and their scavenging and attacks on
unfortunate warbands has ensured a sizeable stash of valuables. In
fact, the Harpies have been nesting on some rather sizeable shards
of wyrdstone closely resembling eggs of a sort. Partially due to their
maternal instinct and probably due to the corrupting influence of the
wyrdstone the Harpies have grown extremely protective of their nest
and will guard it to the death if need be._

##### Terrain
Start by setting up one of the taller building (8" or taller) in the
centre of the playing area (The top of this is where the
Harpies have built their nest), the rest of the map is set up as normal.

##### Special rules
The nest is absolutely full of items hoarded by the kleptomaniac Harpies - not least a trove of Wyrdstone that the poor creatured had mistaken for eggs!

The winning warband may roll on the chart provided to determine what is
contained in the nest:

| D6 | Item |
| :- | :-: |
|5+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|3+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|5+ | Heavy armour |
|6+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|4+ | Gems worth 30gc |
|6+ | Magical Artefact |
|5+ | Horse |
|3+ | Lucky charm |
|4+ | D3 shields |
|5+ | D3 helmets |
|2+ | D3 swords |

```
```
##### Set-Up
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all their warriors within 8" of that edge. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. There are D3 Harpies in the nest per warband.

##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.


##### Ending the game
A warband wins if all the Harpies have been taken out of action and the other warbands have routed.

The Harpies win if all of the warbands rout before the Harpies have all been
taken out of action.

If one warband remains but there are still harpies, they may continue playing to attempt to clear out the nest.

##### Experience
There are no additional experience bonuses for this scenario.

# The Lost Prince
</div>

_Travelling entertainers often tell tales of the ruined city and because
of this, sons of the privileged classes often see the city of Mordheim
as one big romantic adventure. Sometimes one will run away from
home to join a mercenary warband and make a name for himself._

_Often these individuals are killed before they even get to the city but
once in a while one will get lucky and actually make it that far.
Sometimes their families are happy to see the young fool go but once
in a while, a rich merchant or noble will actually pay to have his
son saved from his inevitable fate in Mordheim._

_The warbands have heard rumours that a powerful man’s son has
wandered into the ruins and a handsome reward will be paid for his
return._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
The merchant’s son is initially placed in the centre of the
board. He will wander D6" in a random direction at the start
of each of the first player’s turns, until someone ‘rescues’
him. If a warband member comes into contact with the merchant’s son (through normal movement, NOT through charging – this is an exception to the normal rules and represents that the merchant’s son is not the enemy and should not be engaged in combat), the boy will attach himself to that member and follow him around. Warriors that cannot gain experience may not attempt to speak to the merchant's son.

If the ‘rescuer’ is taken out of action, flees or routs, the merchant’s son will attach himself to the next warband member to contact him.

Should someone wish to attack the merchant’s son, he has the following statline and is equipped with a Dagger:

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|   | 4 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 |	
If he is killed, no reward will be issued to the winning warband, of course.
```
```

##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get the merchant’s son off of the table edge they deployed on. That warband (and any allied warband) is the winner. Alternatively the game is won if all other warbands have routed. Killing the Prince will not end the scenario.

##### Experience
**Escort Service:** A Hero that escorts the Young Prince off of the table gets +1 experience.

### The Reward

| D6 | Item |
| :- | :-: |
|2+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|5+ | Heavy armour |
|4+ | Gems worth 30gc |
|3+ | Purse worth 5D6 gc |
|2+ | D3 swords |

Alternatively the Young Prince may be sacrificed, Sold to The Pits, sold to slavers, eaten, or whatever other particularly evil things a warband can do to a Captured human hero that has failed to be rescued.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# The Pool
</div>

_Rumours abound about a pool in the city whose waters have
magical powers of healing. The warband’s patrons believe the
magical properties of the water are due to a large deposit of
wyrdstone within the pool. The warbands have been sent to collect
as much wyrdstone from the pool as they can._

##### Terrain
Start by setting up a body of water in the middle of the map A handy dandy canal segment would do fine, or simply outline a space of roughly 6" x 6" in the middle of the board. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario - the pool is too spooky to scout out without backup!


##### Special Rules
Roll a D3+3 to find out how many pieces of wyrdstone are in
the pool. The pool functions like any other water feature. 

Any Hero
spending an entire turn touching the pool doing nothing else but searching for wyrdstone may roll at the end of their
turn to see if they finds some. On a D6 roll of 5-6, that player
has found one of the pieces in the pool!

No Hero may search within 1" of another model (friendly or enemy), as models that are too close together disturb the waters for each other, so that neither may see the bottom. Only as many pieces of wyrdstone may be found as were rolled at the beginning of the game, any searching after that is useless. 
```
```
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their Rout test. The routers automatically lose. Alternatively the game ends once all Wyrdstone shards have been taken off of the table, in which case the warband with the most shards is the victor.

##### Experience
**+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter:** Any Hero or Henchman that carried any number of wyrdstone off of the board gains +1 Experience.

<div class='wide'>
# Ambush!
</div>

_The defending warband has recently discovered a rich deposit of
wyrdstone. Unfortunately, word has leaked out about their find and
warbands throughout the city are hunting them, determined to take
the treasure for themselves._
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
Each of the defending warband’s Heroes carries D3 pieces of wyrdstone at the start of the game.


##### Set-Up
All the models in the defending warband must be set up
within 6" of the centre of the board. The attacking warbands
are then set up as normal.
The attacking players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
```
```
##### Starting the game
The attacking players each roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise, with the Defender going last.

##### Ending the game
The Defender does not need to roll for rout tests this game, their warband is already in flight! Instead, the game
will last 8 turns or until all the wyrdstone shards have been
carried off the board, whichever comes first. If all the attackers rout any models in the Defender's warband holding wyrdstone is considered to have escaped from the board with it for the purposes of experience gian.

The warband that gets the most wyrdstone shards off the table (or held by its warriors if the game ends by turn limit) is considered the winner. The defending warband may only exit the board via an attacker's deployment zone.

##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Heroes or Henchmen that carry at least one shard of Wyrdstone off of the table get +1 Experience. 

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Monster Hunt
</div>

_The warbands have heard rumours that a terrible monster has come
up out of its lair beneath the city following the recent devastation
and established a new home in the ruins. You have heard stories of
such creatures and the treasure they accumulate is the stuff of
legends. You have decided to see for yourself if the rumours are
true._
##### Terrain
Start by setting up a suitable monster lair in the centre of the playing area. It may be worth determining what actually lives there beforehand, the rest of the map is set up as normal.


##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.

##### Special rules
The monster’s lair is located in the central building and this is where the beast (or beasts!) will be. 

At the start of the game the monsters are considered non-hostile. They will become hostile if a warrior enters their lair or if they are hit with a missile, or the target of a successfully cast spell. Once hostile they will charge any foes within range or, if there are none in range, will move as quickly as possible towards the model that first turned it hostile. If that warrior is already dead they will move towards the next closest warrior.


##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game
When one warband is the only one to have
any models within the monsters' lair, and the monsters have been put out of action, that warband is victorious and gets
the monster’s hoard.

If the monsters are still alive when the other warbands rout, the remaining player may continue playing to finish them off.


##### Experience
There are no additional Experience bonuses for this scenario.
```
```
#### Treasure hoard

| Item | D6 |
| :- | :-: |
| 5D6 GC | Automatic |
|Magical | artefact 6+ |
|D3+1 pieces of wyrdstone | 4+ |
|Gromril axe | 5+ |
|Suit of heavy armour | 5+ |
|Suit of light armour | 4+ |
|Suit of light armour | 4+ |
|Shield | 4+ |
|Helmet | 4+ |
|D3 swords  | 4+ |
|D3 gems worth 10 GC each | 5+ |
|Jewellery worth 10-60 GC | 5+ |

Great beasts in Mordheim
If fewer than 10 games have been played in the campaign then there are D3 monsters +1 for each warband beyond the second. The monster type present is selected at random from the following:
1: Tree Kin
2: Chaos Spawns
3: River Trolls
4: Rat Ogres

# Writing on The Wall
</div>

By James Burkhouse
The warbands have each heard rumours of a map drawn on an alley
wall on Tyler Street that leads to great treasure! This alley is in the
Poor Quarter, a cluttered and twisting section of the city. Whoever
can decipher the map and keep this precious knowledge from their
enemies will gain a great advantage in the hunt for a fantastic
treasure!
TERRAIN
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. If your terrain
collection allows, a dense warren of narrow, crooked streets
is ideal. In any case, the centre of the table should have two
buildings, placed close together so as to form an alley, one
inch wide. The map will be written in this alley. Because of
the ruins, close confines of the alley, trash, etc., the alley is
considered difficult terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up in
an area roughly 4' x 4'.
WARBANDS
The warband with the lower warband rating chooses whether
to set up first or last. The first player then chooses which
table edge to set up on, and places all of his warriors within
8” of that edge. His opponent then sets up within 8” of the
opposite edge. Because of the dense, mazelike construction
surrounding Tyler Street, skills or abilities which allow
special deployment may not be used.
SPECIAL RULES
The map on the alley wall was written by a madman, and the
warriors in Mordheim will have a tough time puzzling it out
in the middle of a fight! In order to understand the map, a
hero must be moved into the middle of the alley, and must
spend two full turns doing nothing but studying the writing.
Heroes who have taken at least one Academic skill may
decipher the writing in one turn rather than two.
Once a warband has no further use for the map, they may ruin
the wall so other warbands can't follow the directions to the
treasure! The wall has 1 Wound, and a Toughness of 7.
Attacks against the wall automatically hit, and any wound
ruins the map. Anyone attacking the wall must be in the alley
(they cannot ruin the map from the other side of the wall).
The map doesn't lead to a specific treasure; rather it marks
out good routes through the Poor Quarter. Warbands who
have deciphered the map may add one of a kind in the next
exploration phase, after rolling the dice. For example a player
who rolled 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 6 could choose to add another 3
in order to find Prisoners (the result for a triple 3) rather than
a corpse (the result for a double 3). Alternatively, the player
could opt for an extra 5 or 6 in order to find something else
entirely. This addition does not affect how many Wyrdstone
shards the warband recovers. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

STARTING THE GAME
The player with the lower warband rating has first turn.
ENDING THE GAME
If one warband is able to decipher the writing on the wall,
and then ruin said writing, the scenario ends immediately,
and that warband wins.
If both warbands manage to decipher the writing, then the
scenario ends in a draw. If one warband deciphers the writing
and then routs, the game ends in a draw. If the writing is
somehow ruined before it can be deciphered by either
warband, the scenario ends in a draw.
Alternatively, if one side routs, the other wins. The winners
are assumed to decipher and orient the writing at their leisure.
EXPERIENCE
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for any enemy he puts out of action.
+1 for Deciphering the Writing. Any Hero who deciphers
the writing during the battle (limit 1 per warband) gains +1
Experience.
+1 for Ruining the Writing. Any Hero who ruins the
writing (after it has been deciphered!) earns +1 Experience.

# Spawn Hunting
</div>

By Thrasher Kitch
"Over there men! After it! 50 Crowns to the man who brings
that chaos beast down!" shouted Captain Alkazar to his men, as
they chased the twisted Chaos Spawn through the ruined streets
of what was once a productive farming village. In the time after
the comet fell, the streets of Mordheim were tainted by the touch
of the foul gods, and the effects visible in many areas. Men and
women bore twisted visages of their former selves, and much,
much worse was to be found. The touch of Chaos was laid
heavily on the land. Many priests of the righteous gods were
trying to do what they could, but some of the more physical
threats required a less spiritual touch, and more of a physical
beating.
In this case, a Chaos Spawn has been tracked down, and is
terrorizing its way through the remains of the city, and your
warband is chasing it, and trying to bring it down. Or maybe you're
trying to subdue it and bring it under your control, and then use it to
make it your loyal servant. Such a creature would be very, very
powerful to have under your control. However, you've run into a
snag.
Another warband has spotted you, and is closing in to intercept you
and stop the spawn themselves. What is their motive? Why are they
here? Such questions are not to be answered here.
Set Up
The setup is for two or more warbands. The warband with a
highest rating should be set up within 10" of one corner of the
board, as they are the warband hunting the spawn. Place the
spawn 16" from them, directly between them and the centre
of the board (always place it on ground level.) Place opposing
bands on the table edges opposing that player, and within 6"
of the edge. The player may pick which of the two sides he
starts on.
Note: If the warbands taking part in this campaign are highly
rated, you may be better off using multiple spawns instead of
one. So once you hit around 250, try 2, or at 375-400 try 3.
Etc. Alternatively, for multiple warbands, you could also do
it as “Number of Warbands -1” to determine how many
spawn you need.
Terrain
This scenario can take place in any locale. This could easily
be happening in the country side for Empire in Flames, or in
the ruined streets of Mordheim.
Starting the Game
The Spawn gets the first turn, and immediately make a move,
away from the band pursuing them. Then the hunting band
goes second, and roll a D6 for all other warbands taking place
in this scenario, with the highest going first.
This means the Spawn have their own turn, in addition to the
players, so here's the rundown of turn order:
Turn 1: Spawn
Turn 2: Pursuing Band (Highest Rated)
Turn 3-?: The remaining warbands, dice off for turn order.

Special Rules
Wyrdstone Necklace: Make note of which warrior(s) deliver
the killing blow to each of the spawn on the table. After the
fight, roll a D6 for each warrior who took a spawn OOA.
Whichever rolls the highest, he found a mysterious
Wyrdstone pendant around the neck of the spawn. He can
either wear it or sell the pendant to a wandering wizard for
10D6 GC. Should the warrior choose to put it on, consult the
following table for the result. (If the warrior in question is a
henchman, remove him from his existing group and place
him in his own group, which may never be added to again.).
Roll D6 after the game
1 The green stone drains the warrior of his vitality. Roll on
the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 reduce the stat
indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the warrior mutates. All
bands except chaos bands kill a mutating warrior as they start
to change, chaos bands (possessed, carnival of chaos,
beastmen and skaven) may roll a random mutation.
2 No effect beyond dark and troubled dreams.
3-6 Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9
increase the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the
player may choose any stat to increase by 1. The stone is not
powerful enough to increase a stat above a racial maximum,
if this is indicated roll again.
Ending the Game
The game ends only after the Spawn have been taken OOA
and only a single band is remaining on the table. Warbands
may voluntarily rout, following the normal instructions for
such in the Mordheim rulebook.
Experience
+1 Survival: Any Hero or Henchman group which survives
the battle gains +1 experience.
+1 Winning Leader: The Leader (or acting leader) of the
band gains +1 experience for winning the scenario.
+1 per Enemy out of action: A hero earns an additional +1
experience for each enemy they put out of action.
+1 Spawn Wound: A Hero or Henchmen group earns an
additional +1 experience for each wound they do to one of
the Spawn. (A henchman group may not gain more than +1
experience in this way.)

# West Gatehouse
</div>

By Andy Tabor
There are many a vile warband that resides at Cut Throat's Den.
Cut Throat's Den is known to house unscrupulous warbands who
are some of the foulest scum to visit Mordheim. Warbands such as
the Righteous Sisters, Witch Hunters and other do-gooders would
shun such a decadent area.
The main path from Cut Throat's Den to The City of the Damned is
by the West Gatehouse. Normally, most would think nothing of
going to Mordheim via the West Gatehouse but danger lurks at
every corner of Mordheim and this area is not different. The West
Gatehouse remains guarded by a dark and sinister tree beast, and to
enter the city from this direction adventurer must first brave passing
by this monstrosity. Skeletons hang from its branches and who
knows how many skulls are entwined within its blackened roots.
Warbands tend to scale the walls or have found tunnels into the city
from the West side in order to avoid The Giant Oak that lurks at the
West Gatehouse.
The Great Oak that once stood near the ornate gates of the garden
uprooted itself and began a rampage of death and destruction. A
huge one hundred foot tall monster, it smashed through the
perimeter wall of the gardens and began to make its way to the West
Gatehouse where crowds had gathered in a desperate attempt to flee
the disaster.
With evil eyes glowing red, the instrument of the Shadowlord
stomped through the crowd sending broken bodies hurtling through
the air as its huge branches lashed out at the throng. Few managed
to escape the Northwester Quarter of the city during the disaster, as
the monster had rooted itself at the gateway slaughtering all that
dared to pass.
Many warbands have disappeared when they have ventured through
the West Gatehouse. There are rumours The Giant Tree guards not
only the West Gatehouse but treasure. The treasure horde has been
rumoured to include wyrdstone, jewels, armour, weapons, precious
and rare items.
Many warbands have decided to go after the Giant Tree together to
split the riches but many have died by the hands of The Great Oak
or my each other as truces only last as long as a warband wants.
Terrain
This is another great opportunity to use your Warhammer
Fortress set to use as a gatehouse and a surrounding wall
section. There should be terrain but not too much to block the
movement of The Great Oak. Each player takes it in turn to
place a piece of terrain, a ruined building, tower, wall, or
similar piece of terrain. We suggest the terrain is set up
within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6' if you want to use more
warbands or just like more space. Leave a 6” x 6” square in
the middle of the board for the Great Oak.
Set-up
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Special rules
The Giant Oak will be placed in the middle of the board.
Each warband will roll a D3 for the amount of Dark Dryad
that will be placed on the board. The Dark Dryad will be
placed on the board before players roll for sides and will be
placed 8 inches within the Giant Oak. The Giant Oak and
Dark Dryad will always be the last “player” go move or take
its turn.
The profiles of the Giant Oak and Dark Dryad can be found
in the Beasts, Monsters & Townsfolk section of the
Rulebook.

Warbands
Players use normal warband set-up rules (see 'Setting up the
warbands').
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands). The Giant Oak and evil arbours will
be considered the last warband in order of play. I would
suggest that players take turns playing the Evil arbours.
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one has failed their
Rout Test. If two or more warbands are left they may ally
together to end the game but they must agree on how to split
the hoard (if Great Oak and minions are OOA). If an
agreement cannot be worked out then they will fight it out
until a “gentlemen's” agreement is reached.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 For wounding the Shadow Dryad. Any Hero or
Henchman earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on
the Shadow Dryad.
+1 For wounding the Giant Oak. Any Hero or Henchman
earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Giant
Oak.
+2 For taking the Giant Oak out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Giant Oak out of action gets a bonus
+2 experience.

# The Raven Barracks
</div>

By Andy Tabor
The Raven Barracks, located North West side of Mordheim, housed
the military arm of Count Steinhardht. The Empire was deeply
embroiled in a bitter civil war. During this turmoil, Count
Steinhardt refused to commit his forces to any of the three warring
factions. The Count had the finest uniforms made for his soldiers. As
the Empire went to war, expending valuable resources on arms and
soldiers Mordheim grew rich in selling arms and supplies at
extortionate prices to any side. The weapons were for top quality
and craftsmanship.
After the great disaster the barracks are empty of soldiers. The
soldiers have perished or left the city as fast as they could. Now
many warbands are attempting to get to the Raven Barracks to stock
up on supplies for themselves or to sell them at a profit. The City of
the Damned is a dark and deadly place. The route to the barracks is
dangerous and leaving alive from the barracks might be more
difficult than the warbands think.
(Ideas taken from Town Cryer 23/25: Space McQuirk, Nick
Jakos, and Mark Havener)
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, wall, or similar piece of terrain. We
suggest the terrain is set up within an area of 4' x 4' or 4' x 6'.
This is a great opportunity to use your Warhammer Fantasy
Fortress as the Raven Barracks. The barracks should be an
area that is at least 2' x 2' in the middle of the board. Plenty of
terrain should be around the barracks to provide cover and
some obstacles to get there.
Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 +1 crate for each
warband involved in the game on the tabletop to represent
where the crates are. The crates should be 10” inches away
from the table edge and 6” inches away from each other.
Once a model is in base contact with a crate they must wait
till the next turn to move with it. No warband may use
catacombs or other like skills as information provided only
gave a vague area of the barracks.
When a model First touches a crate roll a D6. If the result is a
1 then a trap has been activated. The model takes an automatic wound with no armour saves allowed. Only one trap per crate.
There are many options of supplies to have in the crates. Feel
free to change them to your gaming groups needs.
Supplies The supplies are in crates. Each crate can be carried
by a single model at normal movement rate (no running
allowed). Two models may carry a crate, in which case they
may run. While carrying a crate, the model may not fire any
missile weapons or use any spells. Cavalry, Monstrous Infantry, and Monstrous Cavalry may carry one treasure chest with no penalty. Chariots and Mounted Monsters may carry any number of chests with no penalty (though they may not move in the same turn a chest is loaded into it by another warband member) If attacked, the crate will
be dropped (unless the crate is in a chariot), ready to be carried by anyone coming into
contact with it. Once a model escapes off the board with the
crate, the model and crate cannot return to the board. Each
crate in the possession of a warband at the end of the game
earns them a roll on the Crate table.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 after the terrain has been placed. The
player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and order
proceed clockwise around the table (based on where players
placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get all his men
off his table edge with supplies or when all but one warband
have routed. If one or more warbands have allied, they may
choose to share the victory and end the game.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle, they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+ Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per Leader with most supplies off the board. The
leader whose warband gets the most OFF the board then they
earn +1 Experience.
+1 Per Crate captured. If a Hero or Henchmen takes a crate
OFF the battlefield they earn +1 Experience.

# Wizard's Mansion
</div>

By Michael Havener
Not all of the ruined buildings in the city are ordinary houses. Some
notable structures were the abodes of important town leaders or
rich merchants. Tales are told of hidden rooms filled with treasure
in such homes. The warbands have discovered the location of one
such building. Rumours abound that the former owner also dabbled
in the arcane arts, which may explain why his home was almost
untouched by the devastation.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that
the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4" x 6". The first
building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the
objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
Warbands
One player is the defender, determined as normal (see
‘Attackers and defenders’ at the beginning of the article),
representing the warband that reached the mansion first. The
defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective
building. Then the attacking warbands are set up as normal.
In addition, for each attacking warband beyond the first, the
defender rolls once on the table below to determine the
additional equipment his warband gets to start with. Each
item may only be found once. If the same number is rolled
more than once, re-roll. These items represent the findings of
the warband thus far and are meant to give the warband a
chance against multiple opponents.
D6 Item Found
1 Wooden Man
2 D3 doses of Mandrake Root
3 D3 doses of Crimson Shade
4 Lucky Charm
5 Holy (Unholy) Relic
6 Cathayan Silk Cloak
All of the above are described in the Mordheim rules except
for the Wooden Man. For rules on the Wooden Man, see new
items opposite.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The routers automatically lose. If one of more
warbands have allied, they may choose to share the victory
and end the game.

Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
The Wizard’s Treasure
At the end of the game the winning warband finds all of the
items on the table above which were not found before the
battle. In addition, roll on the following chart to see what
additional items the warband finds in the mansion. Note that
you’ll roll for each item separately, apart from gold crowns,
which are always found. For example, you will need to roll a
4+ to find a Tome of Magic. Then roll to see if you find the
Gromril Sword and so on.
D6 Roll Needed
3D6 GC Automatic
D3 gems worth 10 GC each 5+
Tome of magic 4+
Gromril sword 5+
Athame 4+
D3 doses of healing herbs 4+
Dispel scroll 5+
New items
Wooden Man: Use the stats and special rules for a zombie
with +1S and +1T. The Wooden Man is an artificial construct
in the shape of a man but made of wood. It will follow the
commands of the defending warband but will not leave the
wizard’s mansion for any reason, even after the game. The
Wooden Man may obviously not be traded.
Athame: An Athame is a special silver dagger used in
magical rituals. If used in combat, it will not hold its edge.
For the first attack in a game, it will count as a normal
dagger. However, for the rest of the game it will count as a
fist attack. The Athame is worth 10 gold crowns if traded.

# The Gaol
</div>

The battle in the Gaol grounds is a Skirmish. Both Warbands have
happened upon the area at the same time and are fighting it out for
control, so they can loot it. Little do they realise the presence of the
dreaded ‘Warden’...
Terrain
Choose any one neutral table edge of a 4'x4' area and place a
large ruined building on the chosen table edge just on the
table. This represents a part of the Gaol. The rest of the
gaming area represents the Gaol grounds and terrain should
be set up in a mutually agreeable manner.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating decides. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge. Players cannot choose the table edge
that has the Gaol building on or the edge opposite the Gaol.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score
takes the first turn. The Warden and the Inmates (see below)
take a turn after both players have had their turn and are
effectively a third player ie, after the last player has finished
his turn, the Warden and the Inmates get their first turn. Play
then continues as normal.

Special rules
The Warden and his Lackeys: Hidden within the dark
recesses of the Gaol is a thing known by local scavengers and
warbands as ‘The Warden’. No one knows what it once was;
some say it was a large guard dog, others that it is a bonded
and mutated group of prison guards. Whatever its true
origins, the Warden now wanders the ruins of the Gaol
feeding off any foolish enough to enter its realm. The Warden
is served by a group of ‘Inmates’ – surviving convicts of the
cataclysm since driven mad. They will attack and capture any
in their wake so their master may feed.
The Inmates have the same stats as a Dreg, you can also use
Dreg models to represent Inmates on the tabletop. There are
two Inmates in the scenario for each participating warband; they will work together as a
mob and must stay within 2" of each other at all times. They
will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest
warrior. If the Inmates manage to injure a warrior then ignore
the out of action result on the Injury table, instead the warrior
will be treated as stunned for D3 turns. Whilst a warrior is
stunned the Inmates will carry the warrior towards the
Warden (unless impeded by being charged, etc) at a rate of 4"
(they cannot charge or run whilst carrying the warrior). Note
that two Inmates can carry the warrior without reduction in
their movement, however, if reduced to one Inmate then the
remaining Inmate can only move 2" a turn. If they reach the
Warden in time, the stunned warrior is consumed. The
warrior is taken out of action and is considered dead for the
purposes of the campaign.
If this scenario is rolled before 10 games have been played then the Warden has the same statistics and abilities as a
Possessed. If more than 10 games have occured the Possessed gains +1 to all its characteristics. The Warden will move towards – and charge, if in
range – the nearest warrior. If it wins a combat it will move
towards the next nearest warrior.
NOTE: Both the Warden and the Inmates all start the game
within the Gaol and move out of this building towards the
warriors that are closest to it at first and then the warrior
that is closest to them, as described in the rules above.
If a Hero enters the Gaol and remains there until the end of
the game he will gain +1 dice for Exploration (even if an
enemy warrior is present).
    Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing Warband loses and their opponents win.
    Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Winning Leader. The Leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action (this includes the
Inmates).
+2 Slaying the Warden. Should a Hero or Henchman group
put the Warden out of action they gain +2 Experience.

# Executioners' Square
</div>

By Nick Kyme and Andy Hall
One of the oldest places in Mordheim, Executioner’s Square was
named for obvious reasons, the daily executions were a crowd
puller making the area busy and surrounding businesses successful.
Now the gallows and chopping block stand deserted amongst the
rubble. Since Mordheim’s downfall the many victims of
Executioner’s square – the guilty and innocent alike - have returned
as restless spirits eager to scream their anger at all who pass or
linger.
Both warbands have come to Executioner’s Square with one
purpose – to fight. Such places are often the arena for so-called
‘pitched battles’, open, bloody and vicious. Little do they realise of
the latent spirits, yearning to vent their anger against them.
Terrain
This scenario is played on a 4' x 4' playing area as normal. No
buildings can be placed in a central 2' x 2' area although they
can be placed along this boundary as this represents the
square. Rubble pieces and other such flotsam can be placed in
around the square as normal. In the centre of the square, place
a piece of terrain to represent the gallows and/or chopping
block. Place terrain in the remaining gaming area as normal.
The scenario works best if this is particularly dense.
Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score
decides which warband sets up first. In the case of a tie, the
warband with the lowest rating may choose. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with highest score takes
the first turn. If the result is a tie the player with the smaller
warband, in terms of actual models, may choose to go first or
second.

Special rules
Anger of the Damned: The restless spirits of Executioner’s
Square vent their eternal anger at any who roam in or close to
the square. They manifest as concentrated and violent gusts
of wind; the howling is their screams of rage. At the
beginning of each players turn roll a D6. On a roll of 1 the
spirits stay silent and nothing happens this turn. If the result
is a 2 or more a spirit attacks. If the number is even (2, 4, 6)
then the player whose turn it is must choose one of his
warriors to be attacked. If the number is odd (3, 5) then his
opponent must choose one of the controlling player’s
warriors to be attacked. Note it is always the player whose
turn it is that is attacked by spirits, the only difference is
whether or not he or his opponent chooses the affected
model.
An attacked warrior is automatically hit by a Strength 2
attack (no armour modifiers) and is blown directly backwards
D6". If an attacked warrior is in an elevated position such as
a gantry or an upper floor of a building then there is a good
chance he may be blown off and if this is the case treat the
model as falling. If a model is blown into a piece of terrain
(such as a mound of rubble or the wall of a building) or
blown into another warrior, friend or foe, then the warrior (or
both warriors if it hits another model) is knocked down but
may get up at the start of his next turn should he survive.
Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing warband loses and their opponents win.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle.
+1 Wining Leader. The Leader of the winning Warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Trophy from the Square. If a Hero manages to stay on
the gallows (or the piece of terrain representing the gallows)
at the centre of the square for one complete turn then he gains
+1 Experience.

# The Great Library
</div>

By Andy Tabor
The North-East Quarter of Mordheim was renowned for trade and
learning. When Mordheim was a living city, the crowded labyrinth
of streets and market plazas were called the Merchant's Quarter,
more commonly known as the District of the Flying Horse.
Mordheim became known as the finest market of the city in the
Empire, rivalling even the busiest ports as Marienburg. There were
many traders who would claim that for the right price they could
locate any object for you so desired in a day.
Another notable aspect of the North-Eastern Quarter was the Great
Library. During the rule of the extravagant Count Ignatius
Steinhardt, the library grew extensively to become the largest
building in the entire city. The Count was particularly fond of
collecting mystical and religious tomes. Of course, unwittingly, The
Great Library managed to collect on of the largest deposits of
Daemonic and Necromantic lore in the Empire.
Now after the disaster struck Mordheim Library was engulfed by
flames from the comet. Only the bravest ever consider going
anywhere near the ruins but the lure of ancient tomes is enough to
persuade mages from across the Empire to hire warbands to
retrieve any books that they can find. For enough gold, fools can
find enough bravery to risk even this dark place.
(Credit given to TC 25 Space McQuirk and Nick Jakos.)
Terrain
Each player will take it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a small building, or other piece of terrain. If you have
one piece of terrain or several that could “act” as the Library
should be placed in the middle. Many of the tomes have been
spewed across the many blocks close to the Library. The
battle is fought in an area roughly 4' x 4'. You may want to
make the table larger if this is to be a multiplayer game.
Special Rules & Set Up
Players should then place D3 +1 Tomes for each warband
involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the
Tomes are. Each player takes it in turn to place a Tome
counter. The counters must be placed more than 10” away
from the edge of the table and at least 6” away from each
other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which
edge the warbands will play from. A warrior can carry any
amount of Tomes without any penalty. Warriors cannot
transfer their Tomes to another warrior. If a warrior is put
OOA then the Tome is placed next to where the model was
taken OOA. The Tomes cause FEAR. You must take a FEAR
test to pick one up, unless you are immune to FEAR. This is
to represent the great unknown on whether or not the Tomes
are Evil. To represent the chaotic nature of the disaster and
the many magic tomes that are scattered in the area warbands
will roll on the Random Happenings.
Warbands will begin rolling on the Random Happenings
chart when the first model touches a tome and will continue
then at the beginning of each warbands turn. Yes, the first
warband that touches a Tome will roll on the Random
Happenings chart even though it will already be in the middle
of their turn.

Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’). Special deployment may not be used for this scenario, as whatever they think they have scouted probably will probably have changed by the time their comrades arrive.
Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table.
Ending the game
The game ends when all the warbands but one have failed
their Rout Test. Warbands that Rout, automatically lose. If
two or more warbands have allied they may choose to share
the victory and end the game, or they may continue the game
until one warband is victorious.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader(s). The leader of the winning
warband(s) gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each Tome Picked Up. If a Hero or Henchmen is
carrying a Tome counter at the end of the game he receives
+1 Experience.
+1 For the Warband with the Most Tomes. The leader of
the warband with the most tomes at the end of the game gains
+1 Experience.
Ill Gotten Gains...
You can sell the Tomes for 25 +1D6 or choose to keep the
scroll. If you keep a scroll then roll on the chart below (1D6).
Rolling on the chart below will represent that the Hero has
decided to open the scroll and is trying to decipher its
abilities. Please nominate which Hero will be opening the
scroll.
D6 Events
1. The Hero who keeps the scroll will set out the next
    game. You may come up with some creative on why
    he cannot play the next game from opening the scroll.
2. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain +1 Initiative.
    This can take you above our racial Maximum.
3-5. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain an Academic
    Skill. Those who normally cannot gain a Academic
    Skill can gain one (1) Academic Skill. Please note that
    this is for only one time and does not grant the user to
    gain Academic Skills through normal experience.
6. The Hero who opens the scroll will gain D3
    experience.

# The Middle Bridge
</div>

By Andy Tabor
The Middle Bridge is the main crossing point for the City of the
Damned. Whoever holds the bridge controls all aspects of movement
in Mordheim. The bridge is rumoured to have piles of Wyrdstone or
Treasure around it but are said to be guarded by massive Trolls,
who have a strange affinity for bridges.
Terrain
The gaming table can be as big as 4' x 4' or small as 2' x 2'.
You can easily make a bridge and river out of coloured paper
or plastic.
Special Rules
Place D3 +1 Trolls for each warband in the water and within
6” inches of the bridge. Place 1 Troll for each warband in the
middle of the bridge and the remainder Trolls should be
placed in the water. I would suggest that this scenario be
limited to one to two warbands. You can have one warband
go at a time to secure the bridge or have two warbands
attempt capture and control the bridge, while fighting off the
Trolls. In addition to the normal rules for Trolls, please use
the special rules below if you like.
Fog. The area will be affected by fog. Movement and
shooting distance will be halved. You may charge as normal.
Dumb Creatures of Habit. The Trolls under the bridge have
become so practiced and cunning at taking out travellers what
when a Troll is within 6” inches of the bridge it is allowed to
take Stupidity tests at double their normal leadership (all the
way up to 8). The Trolls will stay within 6” inches of the
bridge at all times.
Massive Troll. The Wyrdstone collected by the Trolls have
made them stronger. Their wounds and attacks are now 4
versus 3.
All Alone. Trolls are used to being all alone and will ignore
this rule.
Route Tests. Trolls will ignore all route tests.
River Trolls. Enemies attempting HTH with the Troll suffer
a -1 to hit. A roll of a 6 will always hit.

Warbands
All players roll a D6 to see who deploys first, with the player
rolling the highest choosing the table edge.
Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there. The Troll
will always go last.
Ending the game
The game ends when all but one warband has failed their
route test. The routers will automatically lose.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband
gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+2 per Troll out of Action. Any Hero earns +2 Experiences
for each Troll he puts out of action.
Winning Warband Rewards
The winning warband may gain a onetime 5D6 gold. This
will represent collecting tolls from other warbands and
merchants who peddle their wares and will be able to choose
the next scenario they play by hearing rumours from
travellers passing through.
Optional Rules
If you are playing a structured map based campaign this is an
excellent scenario to gain control over parts of Mordheim.
There are many more additions you can make to this
scenario. You can tie it into the Encampment Rules. Another
option could a continued revenue generator throughout the
campaign, thus allowing the warband who controls the bridge
some revenue generated weekly or monthly. All this can
easily be decided by your gaming group. Your gaming group
can also change the type of monsters that live at the bridge. If
someone chooses to stand off and shoot at the Trolls from a
distance and keeping the Trolls within 6” inches of the bridge
shall punished with a Chaos Spawn coming onto the playing
table from their deployment and moving as fast as possible
towards that warband to engage in HTH with that warband.
You can be creative in this endeavour and punish those
warbands who have no backbone.

# Last Orders!
</div>

It can be found on the ambiguous borders of the
Chaos Wastes. Managed by coolheaded landlord
Knute Alsgaard, the Last Hope inn remains neutral
ground, a sanctuary where in theory, anyone is
permitted to enter. The Last Hope has been built to
withstand the worst kinds of predators in the
territory. It is as much a fortress as it is a watering
hole for exiles.
Visitors relinquish any weapons they are carrying
upon strict inspection. Sometimes these are returned
to their owners. Alsgaard is an astute dealmaker and
the Last Hope acts as a trading post that supplies arms
and opulent goods to travellers and warriors. Patrons
suffer the Norse proprietor’s inflation in isolation.
The potent house ale never disappoints a dwarf.
An unlikely mix of clientele frequents the Last Hope.
Here is where daring adventurers from Bretonnia may
come to discuss music with a Vampire. It is where a
Kossar dines frequently with warriors of the Kurgan
tribes. Imperial soldiers exchange information with
elves while casting a shifty gaze over at the ogres who
brought in whoever they pleased to do illicit trade
with.
On this particular evening the owner of the holding
decided to turn in early. Taking the evening off
Alsgaard leaves his customers in the capable hands of
a full complement of bar staff. A drink is spilled! The
brawl begins… 

Terrain
This scenario takes place inside a large inn. The layout
of the inn is decided by the players using any suitable
terrain that they have available, although we would
suggest the following:
The site of this ‘battle’ should consist of two or three
sections, at least 10” x 10”, and not needing to be
more than 18” x 18”. There is one section to represent
each floor of the inn.
The ground floor is the location of the bar room. It
should be relatively open. It should include a bar, a
few tables plus several chairs or benches scattered
around. Stairs lead up to the upper floor. There might
be a wine cellar, a kitchen, a store room or a lavatory.
The upper floor of the inn consists of a series of
rooms off a main hallway. Each room might include a
bed. Add other furnishings you desire. Do not forget
to include a marker to represent the top of the stairs
from below. Add another set of stairs to the next level
if you have one! The Last Hope is a fortress so it has
another floor, which is in the open air. The roof! 

Warbands
Animals, Mounts, and Monsters are not permitted within the tavern. That includes dogs nowadays!

set-up
The warbands are scattered about the inn when the
trouble starts. Randomly determine which floor of the
inn each warband member begins on. Then each
player takes turns placing each warrior in his warband.
Warriors may not be placed in hand-to-hand combat. 

starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The highest scoring player
takes the first turn. 

special rules
Diving Charges: Warriors may always attempt a Diving Charge from the tables and bar, irrespective of the
height of the furniture. Stairs may also be used.
Unarmed: All weapons have been confiscated for this game. Armour can be worn including helmets and
shields. Miscellaneous equipment can be carried.
Weapons Amnesty: Due to the generally non-lethal nature of the weapons used in this fight, players
should roll twice for Injury for each warrior taken out
of action during the game, and choose the best result.
Injuries for Heroes are rolled twice. In some cases,
which result is determined to be the best may be
something the player has to decide for himself!

ending the game
The warriors have been indulging in the inn's
refreshments and are now very refreshed indeed! No
Rout tests are necessary – the winner is the player with
the last standing model. Any player may voluntarily
rout if the excitement becomes too much. 

experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains +1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action. 

random happenings
The following random happenings replace the events
described in the Random Happenings section when
using this scenario.

At the start of each player’s turn, roll a D6. If the result
is 1 then roll another D6 to determine which event
takes place. Random happenings are commonplace in
the Last Hope! 

D6 Result
1 Kitchen Hands 
The warbands are not alone in the Last Hope. Nearly
a dozen hardened warriors are employed to run the
inn and keep it safe from outsiders. Kitchen workers
and bar staff enjoy a good brawl as well!
One randomly determined member of your warband,
that is not knocked down or stunned, takes a single
Strength 3 hit from the inn staff. These attacks will not
cause Critical Hits.

2 Buxom Barmaid 
A busty serving wench flits about the bar, flirting
with patrons. This barmaid has a body to die for…
The barmaid will approach a randomly determined
model from your warband and invite him to defend
her honour against the ‘nasty man over there’. That
warrior must pass a Leadership test or move with all
haste, escaping from combat if necessary, to charge a
randomly determined model. First the player must
roll to determine which warband (including his) and
then roll again to see which model is the target. The
optional rules for escaping from combat can be found
in the rulebook.
The warrior will pursue and fight his new rival until
one of them is taken out of action.
Warriors that are immune to psychology may ignore
the barmaid’s advances.
All of the warriors know that attacking the bar staff
can only result in them getting banned. No model will
risk attacking the barmaid.

3 Liquid Courage 
Heavy quaffing of Alsgaard’s intoxicating home brew
takes its toll on even the most hardened of drinkers.
Randomly determine which model fell off the wagon.
The effects of the ale last the remainder of the battle.
Models that are immune to poison ignore this effect.
 D6 Result
 1 Blurred. The model has -1 Ballistic Skill.
 2 Bungled. The model has -1 Weapon Skill
 3 Drowsy. The model has -1 Initiative.
 4 Sluggish. The model has -1 Movement.
 5 Fortitude. The model has +1 Wound.
 6 Leathered! Roll twice on this table.
 
4 Renegade 
There is a mercenary leaning against the wall. The
veteran casually observes the mayhem, quietly
sipping from his stein. Ducking crudely improvised
projectiles, this renegade waits to offer his services.
The renegade approaches a random unengaged
warrior of your warband. The model may pay him 3
gold crowns. Any models are assumed to be carrying
some of the gold crowns from whatever is left in the
warbands treasury.
If paid, he'll toss a throwing knife at a target of the
player’s choice. On a 1-3 the renegade pockets the
gold and asks for more. The renegade continues to
take a further 3 gold crowns until a knife is thrown or
until the player chooses not to pay him.
The thrown knife will hit the target on a roll of 4+
with Strength 4.

5 Ogre Bouncer 
The landlord has hired an ogre to work on the door.
The bouncer is not at all happy that he has suddenly
got so much hard graft to do.
Place the ogre bouncer at the doorway to the inn. See
the Bestiary for the profile and rules of an Ogre. No
roll for alignment is required. The bouncer is
employed to charge towards the nearest hand-to-hand
combat, engaging as many models as possible.
If no hand-to-hand combat is taking place then the
ogre bouncer will stand his ground, watching for any
further trouble.
Re-roll this result if the ogre has been places already.

6 Ornamental Weapon 
A member of the clientele has located a sword among
the many trophies and decorations on display at the
inn. The warrior sets to work trying to prise it free
from the wall fittings. It appears to be stuck fast.
Determine a random model from the warband. If the
warrior passes a Strength test he finds a sword.

Improvised weapons
Being forbidden to bring their weapons into the bar
means that the warriors must make do with whatever
comes to hand in the Last Hope. At the start of any
turn, a warrior can search the inn for a blunt
implement to use as a bludgeoning weapon. This
could be a bowl, a stein, a cooking ladle, the leg of a
chair or a local codger’s walking stick!). Only warriors
capable of gaining experience may attempt to search.

If a search is attempted the warrior may not charge.
Roll a D6: on a 3-6 the fighter finds something
suitable, but on a 1-2 nothing close by will work and
the warrior will have to make do with his fists. A
warrior searching for a weapon in combat will strike
last that turn, regardless of success. A warrior with a
weapon may not improvise another. If a weapon is
found, treat it as a club with the following features:

Range: Close Combat
Strength: As user 
Breakable: If the warrior attempts a close combat
attack with an improvised weapon and rolls a 1 to hit,
the item has broken and becomes useless. The warrior
must resort to his fists for the rest of the combat and
may search for another weapon in the next turn.
Projectile: Alternatively, a warrior may treat the Projectile:
improvised weapon as a missile. The weapon is
automatically lost after it has been thrown. A weapon
is thrown as a missile using the following features.
Range: 6”; Strength: As user;
Special Rules: Thrown Weapon

# Statue of St. Voller
</div>

The story of Saint Voller is all but lost to history, the documentation of her works largely kept within the great libraries of Mordheim. Folklore and myth is all that survives by way of her legacy, but whatever the truth may have been she is revered by the Cult of Morr as one of their matron saints. Her statue was a place of pilgrimage to many who prayed that the dead keep their rest, and due to the wild and wonton magical experimentation present in Mordheim before the meteor strike her blessings were desperately sought after lest a lost loved one be forced to live an eternity of servitude at the hands of some vile necromancer some day. When the statue miraculously survived the meteor strike many survivors deemed it a blessing of Morr itself, and survivors brought their dead by the cartload to the statue in the hopes that their deaths be consecrated and their souls kept safe. Bodies piled the pavements, and with no safe way out of the city to bury them the surrounding buildings became macabre warehouses stacked to the rafters with corpses simply to keep the roads clear.

So many dead and dying in one place was never going to end well. The sheer concentration of corpses and the opportunity to desecrate a shrine to a hated nemesis drew the attention of necromancers even beyond the city walls, and for a few mortifying months the plaza surrounding the statue became a Mecca for necromancers looking to practice their arts and refresh their supply of corpses. The district is lost to the undead now, for whatever riches it may hold simply aren't worth the inevitable wall of attrition that the thousands of reanimated corpses can provide, save for the statue itself. The Statue of Saint Voller maintains the properties of her patron god Morr, an anathema to all things undead. Undead who approach find their souls drained from their bodies, eventually disintegrating into nothingness without their sustenance. Harnessing the power of this statue or corrupting it to your own ends will prove a valuable asset within the City of The Damned, but warbands will need to move quickly. Noise awakens the unquiet dead within these sardine-packed buildings.

Terrain
The city is set up as per regular Mordheim. In the centre of the battlefield should be a
large statue – the shrine representing Saint Voller.

Starting the game
Roll a D6, the highest roll goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise. Special deployment rules may not be used for this scenario, no scout would be mad enough to camp out in a warehouse so zombie-infested that there's no room to stand.

Special rules
The Unquiet Dead: At the end of each round turn every building's occupants will begin to stir. Gnarled and withered hands pull at boarded-up windows, and mindless groans dryly echo through the decreasingly deserted streets. For every building on the map roll a D6. On a result of a 1 or 2 D3+1 Zombies will emerge, touching the building and placed between it and the nearest Warband member. This counts as their movement action. If a Warband Member is in the building and is not Hidden then the Unquiet Dead subtract 2 from the roll to see if they emerge. If the nearest Warband member is inside the building then all emerging zombies from that building will immediately go into combat with them, counting as charging, and dividing up between all warband members inside. These Zombies are the same as the Henchmen from the Undead warband, though they do not grant any Experience for taking Out of Action.

Shhhhh!: The Unquiet Dead ironically prefer peace and quiet, being drawn to attack sources of noise nearby. If a Blackpowder Weapon is fired the nearest two buildings to the character who fired will immediately spawn zombies as if they had just rolled a 1 or 2 in the Unquiet Dead turn. 

The Statue of Saint Voller: Though Mordheim is lost and a wholly depraved place, the spirit of Saint Voller still exerts some guardianship. Unquiet Dead will never voluntarily move within 4" of the statue, and any Undead model that ends its movement phase within this zone must take a leadership test (they may use their warband leader's leadership). For every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. The statue itself holds an inky black pendant swimming with grey and purple shadows, a Talisman of Saint Voller. This talisman may be retrieved as if it was a shard of wyrdstone, with all the same rules as wyrdstone from the Wyrdstone Hunt.

Ending the game
The game ends when either all warbands but one have failed their rout tests, or if a character escapes the board with the Talisman of Saint Voller.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle
they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. A Hero gains +1 Experience
for each enemy (excluding Unquiet Dead) he puts out of action.

The Talisman of Saint Voller when worn by a non-Undead character causes Terror in Undead models, even though they would usually be immune to psychology. When worn by an Undead warband leader their warband will never crumble due to the loss of a Necromancer or Heirophant, even if the leader is taken Out of Action - their studying of Morr and corruption of Voller's Talisman has made their soul-binding more potent than ever before!

# Merchant Square
</div>

By Andy Tabor
The once thriving Market Square, more commonly known as the
District of the Flying Horse has become a deserted plaza. Only the
exceptionally brave or downright foolhardy dare cross the open
cobbles, where once thousands of merchants sole their wares. To
venture into the Market Square is to expose oneself to all those who
keep a close watch from the surrounding shadow. Many eyes peer
from the dark alleys and ruined buildings, in search of a fresh
opportunity to make a quick killing. There is still a vast quantity of
precious and exotic goods lying in the broken cellars of merchant's
houses for the taking.
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.
In a terrible twist of fate, the Merchants Quarter remains the most
opulent region of the accursed city. Should any adventurous soul
wish to visit the ruined library or take a chance and stroll through
the market place, it is highly likely that they may discover some rare
goods that have survived the fall. Leaving the quarter with your life
is a different matter though, for the District of the Flying Horse is
also rich pickings for those who seek to spill blood.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building or something similar. We suggest that the
terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The middle
area of the board should free of terrain (maybe a fountain or
the like to mark the centre of the square) and to have at least
a 12” inch x 12” inch square open area. This will represent
the Merchant's Square. The buildings placed outside of the
Merchant's Square will represent the Merchant's Homes and
Shoppe's.
Warbands
Players use the normal warband set-up rules (see ‘Setting up
the warbands’).
Special rules
Warbands will begin searching the buildings for common
items. Each warband will roll 1D6 for each searchable
building. If they roll a 4+ they found a common item. In the middle of the Merchant's Square will be D3 crates per warband, working in the same way as the Raven Barracks chests. When
a warband touches a crate they must roll a D6, only rolling once per crate. On a roll of a 1 on a D6, the Black Pegasus will
appear - this replaces the traps found in the Raven Barracks chests. The Black Pegasus will appear 8” inches in on a
Random Table edge. The Black Pegasus will go in the last
turn and will attempt to fly down on the models in the
Merchant's Square. The Black Pegasus will target the closest
model in the Merchant's Square. Merchant's Square is the 12”
x 12” area in the middle of the table as the streets and alleys
would be too narrow for the Pegasus to fly into. If the Black Pegasus is encountered after 10 games have been played in the campaign then it gains +1 to each of its attributes.

Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where the players placed their warbands).
Ending the game
When all the crates are off the table, all but one warband has
routed, or the warbands ally.
Experience
+1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchmen group survives the
battle they gain +1 Experience.
+1 Winning Leader. The leader of a winning warband gain
+1 Experience.
+1 Per Enemy out of Action. Any Hero earn +1 Experience
for each enemy he puts out of action.
+1 Per each crate taken off the board. Any Hero earns +1
Experience for taking a crate off the board.
Items
Common items are found in the houses surrounding the
Market's Square. They are kept no matter if you win or loose.
Remember you need to roll a 4+ for each house to see if you
were able to locate a common item. Only one opportunity per
house. Please keep track of what homes you searched so you
can take them off the list.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Morning Star 1
D3 Spears 2
D3 Bows 3
D3 Crossbow 4
1 Suit of Heavy Armour 5
D3 Nets 6
Rare items can only come from the crates placed in the
middle of the Merchant's Square. Rare items may only be
found if the crate is taken off the table. If no crates made if
off the table then no Rare Items will be found. You will be
much too nervous looking out for the other warbands and a
Black Pegasus to open the crate in the middle of the
Merchant's Square. When the game ends, the winning
warband(s) does not automatically get the crates.
Item D6 Result Needed
D3 Repeater Crossbow 1
D3 Handgun 2
D3 Healing Herbs 3
1 Gromril Weapon 4
1 Dose Bugman's Ale 5
1 Eleven Cloak 6

# Getting Personal
</div>

This scenario is designed for campaign games with any number of players present. A personal dispute has erupted between several famous/infamous characters in Mordheim, and eager to profit from the spoils of this sort of carnage the warbands have rushed in to pick at the remains. Unfortunately they appear to have been rather swept up in it all, and with famous names aligning themselves with warbands unexpectedly they find themselves in the midst of a sudden brawl!

Terrain
The board is set up as per normal Mordheim.

Set-up
Warbands deploy in their usual locations
.
Warbands
In this scenario each warband is joined by a randomly selected character from the list of MVPs! These characters are completely controlled by the owning player, though they are treated independently from your warband. They do not count for the purposes of either warband size or as losses for routing, and if your warband routs then the player may continue to play as the MVP. They also will not drop their unique items when defeated. 

Starting the game
Determined as normal.

Ending the game
The game ends if either one warband remains and all other MVPs have been taken out of action, or if all warbands are routed and there are only MVPs left on the board. In this case there are no winners.

If a warband wins the scenario AND their MVP is still alive then they recieve a bonus 3xp to be distributed as they see fit among their heroes as the MVP thanks them after the battle and tells them some stories!

# The Canals
</div>


Setup: This map takes place using four tiles. Leave an 8" gap between them running down the middle of the board, this represents the canal. The middle of the board will feature four buildings with two long walkways offering crossings over the canal. These are the only two crossing points, and are what the warbands are seeking to control. The rest of the board should feature dense terrain.

Deployment: The warbands deploy up to 12" towards the canal from the corners and 8" towards the opposite table edge. Scout, Infiltrate, and Hunch may not be used in this scenario.

Special Rules: The syrupy swamp-thick muck of Mordheim's polluted canal is home to monsters disgustingly mutated and horrific enough to chill a vampire's marrow. At the start of each round turn (before the first player's go) roll a dice for each warband member in the canal. If any of these results is a 1, then the Abomination has arrived. Randomize which end of the canal it emerges from and it will then move as quickly as possible towards the opposite table edge engaging in combat with nearest model where possible. It is unaffected by the difficult terrain, and if its movement takes it to the table edge it will stop and then turn around. It will repeat this patrolling action until the game is over or it is taken out of action.

Before the comet struck the canals were infamous for their vile pollution, the canal's waters so contaminated with sewage and alchemical reagents' run-off that even droughted beggars wouldn't consider drinking it. The latent wyrdstone energies brought about by the cataclysmic meteor have hardly improved things, transforming the waters into a toxic slurry that coats the flagstones around it like bile. Attempting to leave the canal will require a climbing check as warband members struggle to find purchase on the smooth treacherous stone. This means it requires an initiative test, and mounted units will be unable to exit at all as they become bogged down in the goop. Alternatively a friendly model of the same or larger unit type can move into contact with them and take a strength test to pull them free (good luck pulling an ogre out of a swamp, Brian.) Additionally the waters are so blighted and foul that all Nurgle-aligned models suffer from Stupidity while inside it as they wantonly revel in the filth.

Ending the game: After eight turns the game will end. A warband has won the scenario if either it controls at least three out of the four objective buildings by the end of the eighth turn (only contains warband members owned by the player) or is the last warband remaining.

Rewards:
+1xp for Occupation. If the game ends by turn limit then for each building a warband controls it can give a bonus XP point to one of its occupying members. 
+1 xp for wounding the Abomination. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully wounds the Abomination gains a bonus experience.
+2xp for putting the Abomination OOA. Any Hero or Henchmen that successfully puts the Abomination out of action gains a bonus experience.
Extort Tolls: Warbands that do not rout by the end of the game gain 30 gold per building they control.


The Abomination is a Monster and has the following profile:
M	WS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
2d6	4	5	6	5	1	2D6	10	-

Special Rules:
Ravenous Maw: The Abomination's great slavering orophice is yawning enough to acommodate the largest prey. There is nothing beyond its appetites. It therefore has the Heroic Killing Blow ability.
Magical Monstrosity: The Abomination is a Chaos Spawn so mutated by the twisting of reality caused by the saturation of Wyrdstone energy that the very Winds of Magic distort and tear around it. The Abomination has a 4+ ward save against wounds or failed characteristic tests caused by spells.
Terror
Large Target
No Pain: The Abomination ignores all Knocked Down and Stunned results, instead reducing its attacks characteristic to D6 until the Abomination's next turn.
Immune to Poison

Monsters of Mordheim


Chaos Spawn
Chaos Spawn are followers of chaos who have failed to pleases
their gods. They have been mutated into a hideous mass of limbs,
appendages and all manner of mutations. Their minds are gone,
leaving nothing but a seething mass of bone and flesh.
| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |Chaos Spawn 2D6 3 0 4 5 3 2 D6+110
Special Rules
Fear: Despite its size, the Chaos Spawn is still a fearsome
opponent. It causes fear.
Immune to Psychology: Chaos Spawn are not affected by
psychology (such as fear) and never leave combat.
Move: To move a spawn, roll a Scatter die and move it 2D6"
in that direction, moving around obstacles as necessary.
Should the Scatter die come up with a 'hit' the Spawn moves
directly towards the nearest visible enemy model on the table.
Skull of Steel: The Spawn are virtually immune to pain, as
normal people feel it. In any turn in which the spawn rolls an
injury result of “Knocked Down” or “Stunned”, ignore the
result, instead reduce the monster's attacks to a D3 result,
instead of the D6+1 given in the profile. This hindrance will
continue until the Spawn's next turn, then it is removed.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Chaos
Spawn.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Chaos Spawn out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.
 

Forest Spirits
Forest Spirits inhabit the trees of the forests of the Old World. In
their solid form, they resemble a miniature version of a Treeman,
with soft, damp woody flesh. They are very violent if threatened and
will use their branch like arms with claws of sharp thorns and twigs
to their best advantage.

Shadow Tree-kin 5 3 0 4 5 3 3 3 8
Weapons/Armour: The Dryad and Shadow Dryad has Razor
Sharp Talons (Counts as being armed with two swords), the

and so count as a large target.
Experience

Spirit.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Dryads or Shadow Dryads out of
action gets a bonus +1 experience.
+2 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Tree-kin or Shadow Tree-kin, out of
action gets a bonus +2 experience.


Harpies
The Harpies are jealously protective of the wyrdstone in their nest.
If any model approaches within their charge range then they will
charge. The Harpies will try and coordinate their attacks so at least
one stays back and protects the nest. Therefore, a Harpy may
disengage from a fallen enemy model if there is an opportunity for
one of its companions to charge another model.

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Harpy 4 4 0 4 4 1 2 2 6
Special Rules:
Talons: A Harpy has talons and is accustomed to fighting
unarmed so does not suffer a penalty for doing so.
Fly: A Harpy may fly up to 12". After the Movement phase
the model is assumed to have landed and may be charged. If
on the ground, a Harpy may make a full move and then use
its wings.
Drop Attack: If a Harpy is successful with both attacks in
the first round of combat then the Harpy has successfully
grabbed on to her enemy and swoops back up in the air to
drop the model allowing gravity to do the work instead. The
attacks themselves do not wound, but the person controlling
the Harpy immediately rolls a D6 and a Scatter dice. That is
the distance and direction from the place where the attack
took place that the model will rest. Next the player
controlling the Harpy rolls another D6. This is the distance
from which the model has been dropped. The result is the
Strength of hit (Strength 1 to Strength 6). Normal falling
rules apply. If a model falls into a building than count the fall
to where they land and then determine if the model falls again
if it is within 1" of the edge of the floor. Any model that is
struck by the dropped model will suffer a S3 hit. Large
targets may only be dropped D3 inches since their size and
weight make them more difficult to pick up. Once its
opponent is dropped the Harpy may continue flying and
return to the nest, preparing for another attack. Models that
are stunned or knocked down will not be charged as it is too
difficult for the Harpy to fly that close to the ground and do a
drop attack.
Experience
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Harpy out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.


Trolls
Trolls are large and foul creatures, with gangling limbs and cold,
damp hides. Renowned for their strength and unthinking ferocity,
Trolls can rip a man apart with their bare hands. Trolls are able to
regenerate damaged flesh, and so are all but impossible to kill. Not
only that, they have the ability to vomit the corrosive contents over
their victim, melting armour, flesh and bone with ease. One
particularly vicious form of Troll is the Stone Troll, whose hide is as
tough as rock. They have the strange ability of sucking the very
power of magic out of the surrounding area. River Trolls live in the
marshlands or swamps near the banks of rivers. Their flesh exhumes
a vile slime which chokes anyone nearby.
| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |River Troll 6 3 1 5 4 3 1 3 4
Weapons/Armour: Trolls often carry a big club.
Special Rules
Fear: Trolls are frightening monsters which cause fear.
Stupidity: A Troll is subject to the rules for stupidity.
Regeneration: Trolls have a unique physiology that allow
them to regenerate wounds. Whenever an enemy successfully
inflicts a wound on a Troll roll a D6, on a result of 4 or more
the wound is ignored and the Troll is unhurt. Trolls may not
regenerate wounds caused by fire or fire-based magic. Trolls
never roll for Injury after a battle.
Vomit Attack: Instead of his normal attacks, a Trolls can regurgitate its highly corrosive digestive
juices on an unfortunate hand-to-hand combat opponent. This
is a single attack that automatically hits with a Strength of 5
and ignores armour saves.
Slime: The River Trolls skin exhumes poisonous fumes
which make the Warriors choke. When standing adjacent to
the River Troll any Warrior is at -1 To Hit.
Aquatic: River Trolls may move through water terrain with
no penalty, and count as being in cover whilst they are in the
water.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Troll.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Troll out of action gets a bonus +1
experience.

Weapons/Armour: The Bloodletters carry a Hellblade and
wear Hell-Forged Brass Armour (4+ Armour Save).
Special Rules
Hellblade: The Bloodletter is armed with a Hellblade which
will automatically cause a critical hit if a 4+ is rolled to hit.
Attacks: The Bloodletter has a number of Attacks equal to
the number of opponents it is fighting (down to a minimum
of 2 Attacks). It will split its attacks amongst the opponents,
and no matter how many warriors are involved it may roll to
hit each one at least once. It will also prevent an opponent
from taking any other warrior out of action in the massed
combat, as they will be too concerned with the Daemon to
finish off their other enemy!
Combat: As if drawn by the sounds of clash of steel, The
Bloodletter will seek out the nearest close combat and join in.
If there are no ongoing close combats within range, it will
charge the model with the highest Weapon Skill in order to
do battle with a worthy opponent. If there are no enemies
within charge range, the Daemon will run towards the nearest
warrior, eager to do battle.
Experience
+1 For wounding the Beast. Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Bloodletter
of Khorne.
+1 For taking the Beast out of action. The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Bloodletter of Khorne out of action
gets a bonus +1 experience.


Black Pegasus
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey.

being stunned. Treat any results from the Injury Table as

Treeman (Giant Oak/Great Oak)
Treemen have the appearance of huge trees, many times the height
of a human. They are often mistaken for trees in the forest as their
clawed feet look like roots, and their legs look like the trunk of the
tree.
