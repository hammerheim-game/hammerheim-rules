# Defend the Hoard
</div>

### Scenario: Defend the Hoard

_In this scenario the defending warband has prepared to send an accumulation of Wyrdstone back to their masters._

_Whether it be for sale in the case of Mercenaries, some bribe to win further favours for Skaven, or for returning to the chapel for cleansing in the case of the Sisters of Sigmar, Warbands will have any number of reasons to need to send resources out of the city to further their goals. The defending warband has spent a great deal of time pooling its resources and gathering wyrdstone to send away for sale, but this movement has attracted unwanted attention. Attacking warbands see an unmissable opportunity here, and must attempt to steal as much wealth as possible before the caravan (and more importantly its reinforcements) arrive._
##### Terrain
The defending player sets up a Hoard of their own design: They may choose four buildings and up to four walkways with which to build a defensible combination of structures in the middle of the table (or at least as much so is possible). In the middle of this superstructure is the Horde, a vast mountain of wyrdstone ready to be shipped as cargo. The Horde contains D3+1 shards of wyrdstone for each player participating in the scenario, and attacking players may collect a shard of wyrdstone from the Horde in the same way they would gather a normal shard of wyrdstone - collecting one per turn. As usual, animals may not gather wyrdstone. Defenders may not steal their own wyrdstone.

##### Set-up
The defending player sets up first, then attackers roll a D6 to determine who gets to deploy first, and deploy within 6" of their deployment zone. The defending warband may not form any formal alliances for this battle, and no special deployment rules may be used by any warband.
```
```
##### Starting the game

Attacking warbands roll a D6 and play then proceeds clockwise. The defending player always goes last (and therefore always gets the last play of the game)

##### Ending the game

The game lasts for 8 turns. If the defending player still has at least one warrior within the Hoard at the end of the 8th turn they then win and claim all the Wyrdstone remaining. If the defending player has no warriors remaining at the end of the game then the attackers win. 

Attackers may only keep the Wyrdstone they had in their possession at the end of the game if they did not rout, or carried off of the board. Unclaimed Wyrdstone left in the Horde or on the ground will be taken by the caravan the defenders were attempting to sell to (though they will of course recieve no credit, as it was no longer theirs to sell!). If there is only one attacker left before the eighth turn they may continue to play alone until the turn limit is reached to steal as much Wyrdstone as their warband can manage!

##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Heroes or  Henchmen carrying at least 1 shard of Wyrdstone by the end of the game get +1 Experience. Warbands that rout before the turn limit have dropped their wyrdstone, and do not gain this benefit.	
**+1 Brilliant Defence:** If the defending warband won their leader may gain an additional +1 extra Experience as the caravan owners marvel at their fantastic defiance of the odds.

# Wyrdstone Hunt
</div>

_Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of
priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon
the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the
spoils.
In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while
scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or
other such potentially rich building._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria.

##### Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone
counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are.
There will be D3+1 counters in total.
Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to
see which player goes first. The counters must be placed
more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away
from each other.

Note that counters are placed before
deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a
good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table.
Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into
contact with them, though this will end their turn. They may not perform any further movement or shooting this turn.. A warrior can carry any amount of
wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their
wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a
counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table
where they fell.
```
```
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever
rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite
edge.


##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the
first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.



##### Ending the game
The game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The
routers automatically lose.
##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Any Hero or Henchman that carries any number of Wyrdstone off of the board gain +1 Experience.

# Breakthrough
</div>

_When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating,
warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However,
their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone
for themselves.
Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a
ruined building, tower, or other similar item._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. It is recommended that this scenario is best played with three players, unless the Defender is deemed to be significantly stronger than the other participating warbands.

##### Set-Up
The Defender may choose a single table corner to be their deployment area. They may deploy their entire force within that zone in a 12" by 12" box. It is worth marking these deployment areas as they will be important to know for the Attackers' Breaking Through objective.

Attackers roll a D6 each. Highest roll deploys first on a table edge of their choosing.
```
```

##### Starting the game
The Defender goes last. Roll a D6 to determine which attacker goes first.
##### Ending the game
If the Defending player routs or if all of the Attacking players rout, then the game immediately ends.	
Each Attacking warband must calculate its rout threshold (for example, a warband of 12 has a threshold of 3.). In order for the Attacker to win the scenario they must move this number of Warriors off of either of the table edges in the 12" x 12" zone that the Defender deployed in.
##### Experience
**+1 Breaking Through:** Warriors earn +1 Experience for breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman, then the whole group gains +1 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Street Fight
</div>

_Often warbands will come face to face with each other in the
narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other
without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed._
##### Terrain
This scenario works best in groups of no more than 4 players. While certainly possible to play with more it is advised to re-roll the scenario if your games group has more than 4 players.

Set up a narrow street (approx 5" wide is best) with buildings on either side. In games with more than two players you will need to set up a junction in the middle of the board, allowing routes for each warband - a Street Fight with four players would therefore need to be a crossroad. As best you can, try to set this junction up in such a way that each warband will have about the same distance to travel if they intend on reaching the opposite board edge.

Any area that is not part of any of the buildings and is not in the street is considered _Impassable Terrain_. It will be important to establish with the other players what is or isn't _Impassable Terrain_ before rolling for deployment.


##### Set-up
Players roll a D6 each, the highest roller deploys first. Warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.

```
```
##### Special rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the
battlefield via their own edge.
##### Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
Each warband must calculate its rout threshold (for example, a warband of 12 has a threshold of 3.). In order to win the scenario a warband must move this number of Warriors off of either of the opposite table edge from the exit they deployed in. In three player games players may choose. 

This makes Formal Alliances with your adjacent neighbour particularly valuable.
##### Experience
**+1 Escaping:** Any Hero that escapes off of an opposing board edge gains +1 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Chance Encounter
</div>

_Both warbands have completed their daily search of the ruins and
are on their way back to their encampment when they run into each
other. Neither side was expecting a fight, and the warband that
reacts the quickest has the advantage._
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
Each warband is carrying D3 shards of wyrdstone at the beginning of the battle, plus 1 for each additional warband beyond the second. Mark down the number each warband has.
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.


##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 and adds the normal Initiative of their leader. The player with the higher score goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise.
```
```
##### Ending the game
The battle ends when only one warband is left in the game.
##### Experience
There are no additional Experience bonuses for this scenario.

### Wyrdstone
Both warbands gain all the wyrdstone they were carrying at
the beginning of the battle, minus the number of their own
Heroes that were taken out of action during the game, down
to a minimum of zero. In addition, they gain one extra shard
of wyrdstone for each enemy Hero they take out of action, up
to the maximum number of shards the opposing warband was
carrying at the beginning of the battle.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Hidden Treasure
</div>

_There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed
cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have
heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows
what they will find?_
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 

##### Special rules
All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know
roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the
buildings to find the Treasure Chest. 

Each time a warrior enters a
building which has not been previously searched by either
side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, they have found the treasure!
Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since
they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each
building may only be searched once.
If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only
one building left to search, the Treasure Chest will automatically be
found there.


Whoever recovers the Treasure Chest may roll on the following chart
after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you
roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns,
which are always automatically found. For example, roll to
see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then
roll to see if you find the armour, and so on. This can make
the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also
mean that your warband has risked death for only five gold
crowns!


| Item | Roll Required |
| :- | :-: |
| 5D6 GC | Automatic |
| Magical Artefact | 5+ |
| D3 pieces of wyrdstone | 5+ |
| Suit of heavy armour | 4+ |
| Sword | 3+ |
| D3 gems worth 10 GC each |  5+ |

```
```
##### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. Their opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario.

##### Starting the game
Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.
##### Ending the game
When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband
fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then
gains the treasure chest.
##### Experience
	
**+2 For Finding the Chest:** If a Hero finds the treasure chest
they earn +2 Experience.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Occupy
</div>

_This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings
are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and
holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich
pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the
tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest
to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the
next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of
your standing models is inside and no enemy models are
inside the building.
##### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses
which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within
8" of any table edge the player chooses. Their opponent sets up
within 8" of the opposite side. 
```
```
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests – as the game lasts for a maximum of eight turns. If a warband voluntarily routs they lose all occupation of buildings. If all warbands but one rout before the eight turn time limit the remaining warband is considered to have occupied all buildings.
##### Experience
**+1 Occupation:** Warbands may allocate +1 Experience to their warband leader for each building they Occupy at the end of the game.

# The Rescue
</div>

There are times when your most experienced Heroes are slain, and you mourn them greatly; however, it is often worse for them to be captured by the enemy, as not only will it be likely that you cannot
get them back, but your enemy will also greatly profit from it. 

This is the scenario that warbands will play if they fail to organize the return of a Captured warband member. If such a situation arises, the warband that had a Hero captured may opt to play the next scenario as a Rescue Mission; this cannot be superseded by anything, nor can the warband who captured the Hero deny the Rescue Mission. 

##### Terrain
This scenario takes place in the Defending player's base. This can be
their headquarters within Mordheim or simply the few ruined buildings
that they have chosen to sleep in for the night. In any case the 
Defending player is the one who captured the warband member in
question. 

They may set up the map as they please, with a central 
building (or building superplex) in the middle of the board.

### The Prisoner
The prisoner and their gear are set up in the central building as
described above. The prisoner may not act until they are freed.

The defender is not allowed to attack or “execute” their prisoner, but must attempt to drive off the rescuers. Once the
captive is freed, however, they are fair game.

A prisoner is free to move and fight once cut free by a friendly fighter. The friend moves into base contact with them and spends the rest of the turn cutting them free; the rescuer may not shoot, cast spells, and fight in hand-to-hand or anything else at all.

Once freed, the prisoner may move and attack normally. Note that the captive has no weapons or other equipment until they reclaims their own (or if the friendly fighter gives them something). The attacking warband can reclaim the captive's gear by moving into base contact with the chest. As above, it takes the
rest of an attacker's turn to open the chest.

If the model who opens the
chest later comes in contact with the prisoner, they may give
the prisoner all of their old gear and re-mount if they had one.

##### Set-Up
The warband that captured the Hero is automatically the
defender, and sets up their warband anywhere on the table, though
no warrior may be within 12" of a table edge and no warrior may
be within 6" of another warrior. This must be done before 
rolling for table edges.
##### Starting the game
The Rescuer always gets the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise with the Defender going last.
```
```
### The Captors
**Sentries:** Until the alarm is sounded (see below), the
defender's models are moving about in a somewhat random
pattern, keeping a look out. Each sentry moves d6-3 inches
per turn; roll separately for each model. 

If the result is negative the sentry does not move. After moving each sentry, roll the Scatter dice and turn the model to face the direction indicated. Models with Stupidity move like this until the alarm is sounded (effectively ignoring their Stupidity for now).	
**Sounding the alarm:** Until the alarm is sounded, sentries
move as described above. Sentries that have not been alerted are at Weapon Skill 0 and they may not shoot or
cast spells. After the alarm is sounded, the sentries may move
and attack freely. The alarm can be sounded in a number of ways:	
**Spotting:** Roll 2d6 at the end of each of the defender's turns. This, plus
an individual model's detection range, is the distance at which a model can try to spot the enemy. They must be within the front 90° arc of the model. This represents that the swirling fog and lingering smoke that fills Mordheim is somewhat distracting when an enemy does not clearly present itself; as well, it shows that the attacker is attempting to move more stealthily than normal.	
_Attackers in the open will be spotted on a d6 roll of 2+._	
_Attackers in cover will be spotted on a d6 roll of 4+._	
_Attackers out of sight of a sentry or not in their frontal arc, but within the detection range of the sentry will be “spotted” (more like heard) on a roll of 6._	
_Attackers are immediately spotted if they move into Open Ground within sight of a Sentry_.

If a sentry spots a raider, they sound the alarm. However, they can only give the alarm if they survive the attacker's turn. If they are taken Out of Action, then they cannot sound the alarm.	
**Black Powder Weapons:** Perhaps unsurprisingly, if a Black Powder weapon is fired the alarm is immediately raised.	


##### Ending the game
The game ends if the captive is freed and makes their escape by moving off any table edge. The game also ends if all the
attackers are taken Out of Action. Due to the high tension and stress of the situation the Rescuer does not need to take rout tests (other participating attacking warbands still do however).

If the captive is cut free and then their warband routs before they can flee the table then they must roll for serious injury on the first half of the table. This reflects the odds of a lone and unarmed warrior exhausted by captivity having an extremely low chance of getting back home safely by themselves.

##### Experience

**+2 Escapes:** The captured model gains +2 Experience if they successfully exit the board.	
**+2 Winning Leader (Defender):** The leader of the defending
warband gains +2 Experience if victorious rather than the usual 1.

# Harpy Hunting Grounds
</div>

_The ruined buildings of Mordheim are home to many strange and
fantastical creatures, a number of which are the subjects of rumours
about hidden riches. Occasionally warbands will attempt to
discover whether these rumours are true. Most of the time these
adventurers are never seen again, but often enough they return
laden with treasures; often enough, that is, to convince the rest that
it’s worth a try..._

_A group of three Harpies have nested in one of the tall buildings in
the edge of the ruined city, and their scavenging and attacks on
unfortunate warbands has ensured a sizeable stash of valuables. In
fact, the Harpies have been nesting on some rather sizeable shards
of wyrdstone closely resembling eggs of a sort. Partially due to their
maternal instinct and probably due to the corrupting influence of the
wyrdstone the Harpies have grown extremely protective of their nest
and will guard it to the death if need be._

##### Terrain
Start by setting up one of the taller buildings (8" or taller) in the
centre of the playing area (The top of this is where the
Harpies have built their nest), the rest of the map is set up as normal.

##### Special rules
The nest is absolutely full of items hoarded by the kleptomaniac Harpies - not least a trove of Wyrdstone that the poor creatured had mistaken for eggs!

The winning warband may roll on the chart provided to determine what is
contained in the nest:

| D6 | Item |
| :- | :-: |
|5+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|3+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|5+ | Heavy armour |
|6+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|4+ | Gems worth 30gc |
|6+ | Magical Artefact |
|5+ | Horse |
|3+ | Lucky charm |
|4+ | D3 shields |
|5+ | D3 helmets |
|2+ | D3 swords |

```
```
##### Set-Up
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest sets up first. The first player then chooses which table edge to
set up on, placing all their warriors within 8" of that edge. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. There are D3 Harpies in the nest per warband.

##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes
the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.


##### Ending the game
A warband wins if all the Harpies have been taken out of action and the other warbands have routed.

The Harpies win if all of the warbands rout before the Harpies have all been
taken out of action.

If one warband remains but there are still harpies, they may continue playing to attempt to clear out the nest.

##### Experience
There are no additional experience bonuses for this scenario.

# The Lost Prince
</div>

_Travelling entertainers often tell tales of the ruined city and because
of this, sons of the privileged classes often see the city of Mordheim
as one big romantic adventure. Sometimes one will run away from
home to join a mercenary warband and make a name for himself._

_Often these individuals are killed before they even get to the city but
once in a while one will get lucky and actually make it that far.
Sometimes their families are happy to see the young fool go but once
in a while, a rich merchant or noble will actually pay to have his
son saved from his inevitable fate in Mordheim._

_The warbands have heard rumours that a powerful man’s son has
wandered into the ruins and a handsome reward will be paid for his
return._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
The merchant’s son is initially placed in the centre of the
board. He will wander D6" in a random direction at the start
of each of the first player’s turns, until someone ‘rescues’
him. If a warband member comes into contact with the merchant’s son (through normal movement, NOT through charging – this is an exception to the normal rules and represents that the merchant’s son is not the enemy and should not be engaged in combat), the boy will attach himself to that member and follow him around. Warriors that cannot gain experience may not attempt to speak to the merchant's son.

If the ‘rescuer’ is taken out of action, flees or routs, the merchant’s son will attach himself to the next warband member to contact him.

Should someone wish to attack the merchant’s son, he has the following statline and is equipped with a Dagger:

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|   | 4 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 |	
If he is killed, no reward will be issued to the winning warband, of course.
```
```

##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
The game ends when one warband manages to get the merchant’s son off of the table edge they deployed on. That warband (and any allied warband) is the winner. Alternatively the game is won if all other warbands have routed. Killing the Prince will not end the scenario.

##### Experience
**Escort Service:** A Hero that escorts the Young Prince off of the table gets +1 experience.

### The Reward

| D6 | Item |
| :- | :-: |
|2+ | D3 Shards of Wyrdstone |
|5+ | Heavy armour |
|4+ | Gems worth 30gc |
|3+ | Purse worth 5D6 gc |
|2+ | D3 swords |

Alternatively the Young Prince may be sacrificed, Sold to The Pits, sold to slavers, eaten, or whatever other particularly evil things a warband can do to a Captured human hero that has failed to be rescued.

\page

<div class='wide'>
# The Pool
</div>

_Rumours abound about a pool in the city whose waters have
magical powers of healing. The warband’s patrons believe the
magical properties of the water are due to a large deposit of
wyrdstone within the pool. The warbands have been sent to collect
as much wyrdstone from the pool as they can._

##### Terrain
Start by setting up a body of water in the middle of the map A handy dandy canal segment would do fine, or simply outline a space of roughly 6" x 6" in the middle of the board. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario - the pool is too spooky to scout out without backup!


##### Special Rules
Roll a D3+3 to find out how many pieces of wyrdstone are in
the pool. The pool functions like any other water feature. 

Any Hero
spending an entire turn touching the pool doing nothing else but searching for wyrdstone may roll at the end of their
turn to see if they finds some. On a D6 roll of 5-6, that player
has found one of the pieces in the pool!

No Hero may search within 1" of another model (friendly or enemy), as models that are too close together disturb the waters for each other, so that neither may see the bottom. Only as many pieces of wyrdstone may be found as were rolled at the beginning of the game, any searching after that is useless. 
```
```
##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.
##### Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their Rout test. The routers automatically lose. Alternatively the game ends once all Wyrdstone shards have been taken off of the table, in which case the warband with the most shards is the victor.

##### Experience
**+1 Per Wyrdstone Counter:** Any Hero or Henchman that carried any number of wyrdstone off of the board gains +1 Experience.

<div class='wide'>
# Ambush!
</div>

_The defending warband has recently discovered a rich deposit of
wyrdstone. Unfortunately, word has leaked out about their find and
warbands throughout the city are hunting them, determined to take
the treasure for themselves._
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 
##### Special rules
Each of the defending warband’s Heroes carries D3 pieces of wyrdstone at the start of the game.


##### Set-Up
All the models in the defending warband must be set up
within 6" of the centre of the board. The attacking warbands
are then set up as normal.
The attacking players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
```
```
##### Starting the game
The attacking players each roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise, with the Defender going last.

##### Ending the game
The Defender does not need to roll for rout tests this game, their warband is already in flight! Instead, the game
will last 8 turns or until all the wyrdstone shards have been
carried off the board, whichever comes first. If all the attackers rout any models in the Defender's warband holding wyrdstone is considered to have escaped from the board with it for the purposes of experience gian.

The warband that gets the most wyrdstone shards off the table (or held by its warriors if the game ends by turn limit) is considered the winner. The defending warband may only exit the board via an attacker's deployment zone.

##### Experience
**+1 per Wyrdstone Counter:** Heroes or Henchmen that carry at least one shard of Wyrdstone off of the table get +1 Experience. 

\page

<div class='wide'>
# Monster Hunt
</div>

_The warbands have heard rumours that a terrible monster has come
up out of its lair beneath the city following the recent devastation
and established a new home in the ruins. You have heard stories of
such creatures and the treasure they accumulate is the stuff of
legends. You have decided to see for yourself if the rumours are
true._
##### Terrain
Start by setting up a suitable monster lair in the centre of the playing area. It may be worth determining what actually lives there beforehand, the rest of the map is set up as normal.


##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.

##### Special rules
The monster’s lair is located in the central building and this is where the beast (or beasts!) will be. 

At the start of the game the monsters are considered non-hostile. They will become hostile if a warrior enters their lair or if they are hit with a missile, or the target of a successfully cast spell. Once hostile they will charge any foes within range or, if there are none in range, will move as quickly as possible towards the model that first turned it hostile. If that warrior is already dead they will move towards the next closest warrior.


##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game
When one warband is the only one to have
any models within the monsters' lair, and the monsters have been put out of action, that warband is victorious and gets
the monster’s hoard.

If the monsters are still alive when the other warbands rout, the remaining player may continue playing to finish them off.


##### Experience
There are no additional Experience bonuses for this scenario. Greater beasts give +2 Experience on kill rather than the usual +1.
```
```
#### Treasure hoard

| Item | D6 |
| :- | :-: |
| 5D6 GC | Automatic |
| Magical  artefact | 5+ |
| D3+1 pieces of wyrdstone | 4+ |
| Gromril axe | 5+ |
| Suit of heavy armour | 5+ |
| Suit of light armour | 4+ |
| Suit of light armour | 4+ |
| Shield | 4+ |
| Helmet | 4+ |
| D3 swords  | 4+ |
| D3 gems worth 10 GC each | 5+ |
| Jewellery worth 10-60 GC | 5+ |

### Great beasts in Mordheim
If fewer than 10 games have been played in the campaign then there are D3 monsters +1 for each warband beyond the second. The monster type present is selected at random from the following:

| D6 | Lesser Monsters |
| :- | :-:

# Writing on The Wall
</div>

_The warbands have each heard rumours of a map drawn on an alley
wall on Tyler Street that leads to great treasure! This alley is in the
Poor Quarter, a cluttered and twisting section of the city. Whoever
can decipher the map and keep this precious knowledge from their
enemies will gain a great advantage in the hunt for a fantastic treasure!_


##### Terrain
In the middle of the board set up two buildings such that a long (roughly 10") alleyway (roughly 2" wide) is formed between the two. This alleyway represents Tyler Street. The rest of the board is set up as normal.

##### Set-Up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of their choice. Their opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge. Special Deployment may not be used.

##### Special Rules
The map on the alley wall was written by a madman, and the
warriors in Mordheim will have a tough time puzzling it out
in the middle of a fight!

In order to understand the map, a
hero must be moved into the middle of the alley, and must
spend two full turns doing nothing but studying the writing. Heroes who have taken at least one Academic skill may
decipher the writing in one turn rather than two.

Once a warband has no further use for the map, they may ruin
the wall so other warbands can't follow the directions to the
treasure! The wall has 1 Wound, and a Toughness of 7. Attacks against the wall automatically hit, and any wound ruins the map.

Anyone attacking the wall must be in the alley
(they cannot ruin the map from the other side of the wall or with a ranged attack).

The map doesn't lead to a specific treasure; rather it marks out good routes through the Poor Quarter. The extent to which this will be useful information at all is up for debate however! To interpret how useful these scrawlings are you acquire three Mordheim Maps that you must immediately read after the game - they may not be sold.
```
```


##### STARTING THE GAME
Players each roll a D6. The highest roller goes first, and play continues clockwise.
##### ENDING THE GAME
If one warband is able to decipher the writing on the wall,
and then ruin said writing, the scenario ends immediately,
and that warband wins.
If both warbands manage to decipher the writing, then the
scenario ends in a draw. If one warband deciphers the writing
and then routs, the game ends in a draw. If the writing is
somehow ruined before it can be deciphered by either
warband, the scenario ends in a draw.
Alternatively, if one side routs, the other wins. The winners
are assumed to decipher and orient the writing at their leisure.
##### EXPERIENCE
**+1 for Deciphering the Writing:** Any Hero who deciphers the writing during the battle (limit 1 per warband) gains +1 Experience.
**+1 for Ruining the Writing:** Any Hero who ruins the writing (after it has been deciphered!) earns +1 Experience.

# Spawn Hunting
</div>

_"Over there men! After it! 50 Crowns to the man who brings
that chaos beast down!" shouted Captain Alkazar to his men, as
they chased the twisted Chaos Spawn through the ruined streets
of what was once a productive farming village. In the time after
the comet fell, the streets of Mordheim were tainted by the touch
of the foul gods, and the effects visible in many areas. Men and
women bore twisted visages of their former selves, and much,
much worse was to be found. The touch of Chaos was laid
heavily on the land. Many priests of the righteous gods were
trying to do what they could, but some of the more physical
threats required a less spiritual touch, and more of a physical
beating.
In this case, a Chaos Spawn has been tracked down, and is
terrorizing its way through the remains of the city, and your
warband is chasing it, and trying to bring it down. Or maybe you're
trying to subdue it and bring it under your control, and then use it to
make it your loyal servant. Such a creature would be very, very
powerful to have under your control. However, you've run into a
snag.
Another warband has spotted you, and is closing in to intercept you
and stop the spawn themselves. What is their motive? Why are they
here? Such questions are not to be answered here._
##### Terrain
The city is set up as normal with no special additional criteria. 

##### Set Up
The Defender sets up within 10" of one corner of the board, as they are the warband hunting the spawn. 

Place one Chaos Spawn for every 4 games played so far in the campaign (minimum: 1) 16" from them, directly between them and the centre
of the board (always place it on ground level.) Place opposing
bands on the table edges opposing that player, and within 6"
of the edge. Roll off to determine which attacker chooses which edge.

##### Starting the Game
The Spawn gets the first turn, and immediately make a move,
away from the band pursuing them. Then the hunting band
goes second, and roll a D6 for all other warbands taking place
in this scenario, with the highest going first.
This means the Spawn have their own turn, in addition to the
players, so here's the rundown of turn order:
Turn 1: Spawn
Turn 2: Pursuing Band (Defender)
Turn 3-?: Clockwise order.

```
```
##### Special Rules
**Wyrdstone Necklace:** Make note of which warrior(s) deliver
the killing blow to each of the spawn on the table. After the
fight, roll a D6 for each warrior who took a spawn OOA.

Whichever rolls the highest found a mysterious
Wyrdstone pendant around the neck of the spawn! They can either wear it or sell the pendant to a wandering wizard for 10D6 GC.

Should the warrior choose to put it on, consult the following table for the result. (If the warrior in question is a henchman, remove them from their existing group and place them in their own group, which may never be added to again.).

| D6 | Result |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | The green stone drains the warrior of his vitality. Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 reduce the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the warrior gains a Random Mutation. |
| 2 | No effect beyond dark and troubled dreams. |
| 3~6 | Roll on the henchman advance table, for rolls of 1-9 increase the stat indicated by 1 and for rolls of 10-12 the player may choose any stat to increase by 1.|

##### Ending the Game
The game ends only after the Spawns have all been taken Out of Action and only a single band is remaining on the table. 

##### Experience
There are no additional experience bonuses for this scenario.

# West Gatehouse
</div>

_The West
Gatehouse remains guarded by a dark and sinister tree beast, and to
enter the city from this direction adventurer must first brave passing
by this monstrosity. Skeletons hang from its branches and who
knows how many skulls are entwined within its blackened roots.
Warbands tend to scale the walls or have found tunnels into the city
from the West side in order to avoid The Giant Oak that lurks at the
West Gatehouse.
The Great Oak that once stood near the ornate gates of the garden
uprooted itself and began a rampage of death and destruction. A
huge one hundred foot tall monster, it smashed through the
perimeter wall of the gardens and began to make its way to the West
Gatehouse where crowds had gathered in a desperate attempt to flee
the disaster.
With evil eyes glowing red, the instrument of the Shadowlord
stomped through the crowd sending broken bodies hurtling through
the air as its huge branches lashed out at the throng. Few managed
to escape the Northwester Quarter of the city during the disaster, as
the monster had rooted itself at the gateway slaughtering all that
dared to pass. Many warbands have decided to go after the Giant Tree together to
split the riches but many have died by the hands of The Great Oak
or my each other as truces only last as long as a warband wants._


##### Terrain
This scenario is set up exactly as a Monster Hunt - though the Great Oak will need a much larger lair. Design it to be as much like an abandoned gatehouse fortress as possible!
##### Set-up
Players use normal warband set-up rules. 

The Giant Oak will be placed in the middle of the board. Each warband will roll a D3 for the amount of Shadow Dryads that will be placed on the board. The Shadow Dryads will be
placed on the board before players roll for sides and will be
placed within 8" of the Great Oak. The Great Oak and Shadow Dryads will always be the last “player” go move or take its turn.

The profiles of the Giant Oak and Dark Dryad can be found
in the Monsters of Mordheim section at the end of this chapter.
```
```

##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6, with the highest roller going first. Play then proceeds clockwise. The Giant Oak and evil arbours will be considered the last warband in order of play.
##### Ending the game
The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their Rout Test and the Great Oak is dead. If one warband remains and the Great Oak is still alive, they may continue on their own in an attempt to finish it off. (Limit: 3 turns after last player exits). If the time limit runs out or they rout, the game is a draw.
##### Experience
There are no additional experience bonuses for this scenario.

### Rewards!

Winning the scenario will award the winning player a single Magic Item of their choosing, up to 100 points.

# The Raven Barracks
</div>

_The Raven Barracks, located North West side of Mordheim, housed
the military arm of Count Steinhardht. The Empire was deeply
embroiled in a bitter civil war. During this turmoil, Count
Steinhardt refused to commit his forces to any of the three warring
factions. The Count had the finest uniforms made for his soldiers. As
the Empire went to war, expending valuable resources on arms and
soldiers Mordheim grew rich in selling arms and supplies at
extortionate prices to any side. The weapons were for top quality
and craftsmanship.
After the great disaster the barracks are empty of soldiers. The
soldiers have perished or left the city as fast as they could. Now
many warbands are attempting to get to the Raven Barracks to stock
up on supplies for themselves or to sell them at a profit. The City of
the Damned is a dark and deadly place. The route to the barracks is
dangerous and leaving alive from the barracks might be more
difficult than the warbands think._


##### Terrain
The middle of the board represents The Raven Barracks, and should cover an area that is at least 24"x 24", with an open courtyard in the middle. The rest of the board is deployed as normal.	

##### Special rules
Once you have placed the terrain, place D3 +1 Treasure Chests for each warband involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the Treasure Chests are. The Treasure Chests should be 12” inches away from the table edge and 6” inches away from each other.


When a model First touches a Treasure Chest roll a D6. If the result is a
1 then a trap has been activated. The model takes D3 automatic wounds as spring-loaded barbs fly towards them! They make take saves as normal. Only one trap per Treasure Chest.


##### Set-Up
Players use the normal warband set-up rules, though special deployment may not be used.



##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest roll has the first turn, and play proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game
The game ends if only one warband remains, or if all Treasure Chests leave the board. If only one warband remains they have 2 turns to pick up those dropped by fleeing warbands. Once those turns expire, the game ends. 

The winning warband is the one that acquired the most Treasure Chest at the end of the battle. It is therefore theoretically possible to rout and yet still win.

```
```


##### Experience

**+1 Per Crate captured:** If a Hero or Henchmen takes a crate off the battlefield they earn +1 Experience. They do not get this bonus for holding the chests at the end of the game.


### Treasure!

After the battle during your Income phase, for each Treasure Chest roll a 4D6 and consult the below:


| 4D6 | Result|
| :- | :- |
| 4 | Gems worth 100gc! |
| 5 | Blunderbuss with Heavy Ammunition. |
| 6 | D6 Healing Herbs |
| 7 | Suit of Heavy Armour. |
| 8 | Elven Cloak. |
| 9 | D3 shield and swords. |
| 10~11 | Take a Leadership test on your Warband leader. If passed you find 6D6gc worth of beer! If failed you only find 2D6.. Undead need not test. |
| 12-16 | 4D6 Gold. |
| 17-18 | Clothing, worth 2D6gc per crate including D3 sets of light armour. On a D6 roll of a 6 you leader has found a fancy hat that will increase their leadership range by 6”. |
| 19 | Luxury goods, worth 4D6gc per crate. Hidden inside (1-3) a Wyrdstone Pendulum (4-6) a set of Cathayan Silks. |
| 20 | Blackpowder, worth 5D6gcs per crate, contains one pack of Superior Blackpowder. |
| 21 | D3 Crossbows each with Hunting Bolts (same as hunting arrows). |
| 22 | D3 Suits of heavy armour. |
| 23 | Hochland Hunting Rifle. |
| 24 | One suit of Gromril Amour. |

# Wizard's Mansion
</div>

_Not all of the ruined buildings in the city are ordinary houses. Some
notable structures were the abodes of important town leaders or
rich merchants. Tales are told of hidden rooms filled with treasure
in such homes. The warbands have discovered the location of one
such building. Rumours abound that the former owner also dabbled
in the arcane arts, which may explain why his home was almost
untouched by the devastation._



##### Terrain
Start by setting up four buildings adjacent to one another in the
centre of the board. This is the Wizard's mansion, formerly a vast and opulent complex.


##### Set-Up
The defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective building. Then the attacking warbands are set up as normal.

In addition, for each attacking warband beyond the first, the defender rolls once on the table below to determine the additional equipment his warband gets to start with. Each item may only be found once. If the same number is rolled more than once, re-roll. These items represent the findings of the warband thus far and are meant to give the warband a chance against multiple opponents.


|D6 |Item Found|
| :- | :- |
|1 |Potion of Strength.|
|2 |D3 doses of Mandrake Root.|
|3 |D3 doses of Crimson Shade.|
|4 |Lucky Charm.|
|5 |D3 Fire Bombs.|
|6 | A pointy Wizard's hat that gives +1 to casting attempts.|




##### Starting the game

Each player rolls a D6. The player rolling the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where players placed their warbands).

##### Ending the game

The game ends when all warbands but one have failed their
Rout test. The last warband standing is the winner!

```
```

##### Experience
There are no special bonuses to experience for this scenario.


### The Wizard’s Treasure!
At the end of the game the winning warband finds all of the items on the table which were not found before the battle.

In addition, roll on the following chart to see what additional items the warband finds in the mansion. Note that you’ll roll for each item separately, apart from gold crowns, which are always found. For example, you will need to roll a 4+ to find a Tome of Magic. Then roll to see if you find the Gromril Sword and so on.




| D6 | Item |
| :- | :- |
| Automatic | 3D6 GC Automatic |
|5+ | Gems worth 10 GC each 5+ |
|4+ | Tome of Magic|
|4+ | Gromril Dwarf Axe |
|5+ | Magic Item up to 25 points |
|6+ | Magical Artefact |

# The Gaol
</div>

_The battle in the Gaol grounds is a Skirmish. Both Warbands have
happened upon the area at the same time and are fighting it out for
control, so they can loot it. Little do they realise the presence of the
dreaded ‘Warden’..._

### Terrain
Choose any one neutral table edge of a 4'x4' area and place a
large ruined building on the chosen table edge just on the
table. This represents a part of the Gaol. The rest of the
gaming area represents the Gaol grounds and terrain should
be set up in a mutually agreeable manner.

Note that as a result, this scenario is best played with three players - any more and other players will deploy too far from the Gaol to meaningfully participate.

##### Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score sets up first. The first player
chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all of their warriors within 8" of it. Players cannot choose the table edge
that has the Gaol building on.




##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score
takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise, with the Warden having the final turn.

##### Special rules
**The Warden and his Lackeys:** Hidden within the dark
recesses of the Gaol is a thing known by local scavengers and
warbands as ‘The Warden’. No one knows what it once was;
some say it was a large guard dog, others that it is a bonded
and mutated group of prison guards. Whatever its true
origins, the Warden now wanders the ruins of the Gaol
feeding off any foolish enough to enter its realm. The Warden
is served by a group of ‘Inmates’ – surviving convicts of the
cataclysm since driven mad. They will attack and capture any
in their wake so their master may feed.

The Inmates have the same stats as a Warrior (Mercenary warband) and are each equipped with a club. There are two Inmates in the scenario for each participating warband; they will work together as a mob and must stay within 2" of each other at all times. They will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest
warrior.

If the Inmates manage to injure a warrior then ignore the out of action result on the Injury table, instead the warrior will be treated as stunned for D3 turns. Whilst a warrior is
stunned the Inmates will carry the warrior towards the Warden (unless impeded by being charged, etc) at a rate of 4" (they cannot charge or run whilst carrying the warrior). Note that two Inmates can carry the warrior without reduction in their movement, however, if reduced to one Inmate then the remaining Inmate can only move 2" a turn.

If they reach the Warden in time, the stunned warrior is consumed. The warrior is taken out of action and is considered dead for the purposes of the campaign.

If this scenario is rolled before 10 games have been played then the Warden has the same statistics and abilities as a
Possessed. If more than 10 games have occured the Possessed gains +1 to all its characteristics.

The Warden will move towards – and charge, if in range – the nearest warrior. If it wins a combat it will move towards the next nearest warrior.

NOTE: Both the Warden and the Inmates all start the game
within the Gaol and move out of this building towards the
warriors that are closest to it at first and then the warrior
that is closest to them, as described in the rules above.
If a Hero enters the Gaol and remains there until the end of
the game he will gain +1 dice for Exploration (even if an
enemy warrior is present).

##### Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game ends.
The routing Warband loses and their opponents win.
##### Experience
There are no special experience bonuses for this scenario.

# Executioners' Square
</div>

_One of the oldest places in Mordheim, Executioner’s Square was
named for obvious reasons, the daily executions were a crowd
puller making the area busy and surrounding businesses successful.
Now the gallows and chopping block stand deserted amongst the
rubble. Since Mordheim’s downfall the many victims of
Executioner’s square – the guilty and innocent alike - have returned
as restless spirits eager to scream their anger at all who pass or
linger.
Both warbands have come to Executioner’s Square with one
purpose – to fight. Such places are often the arena for so-called
‘pitched battles’, open, bloody and vicious. Little do they realise of
the latent spirits, yearning to vent their anger against them._

##### Terrain
Set up the Terrain as you normally would, but in the middle of the board is a small building or gallows from which the Executioner performed their grizzly services.

##### Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score sets up first. The first player
chooses the table edge they want to set up on, and places all of
his warriors within 8" of it. Their opponent then sets up within
8" of the opposite edge.


##### Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with highest score takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.

```
```
##### Special rules
**Anger of the Damned:** The restless spirits of Executioner’s
Square vent their eternal anger at any who roam in or close to
the square. They manifest as concentrated and violent gusts
of wind; the howling is their screams of rage. At the
beginning of each players turn roll a D6.

On a roll of 1 the
spirits stay silent and nothing happens this turn. If the result
is a 2 or more a spirit attacks.

If the number is even (2, 4, 6)
then the player whose turn it is must choose one of his
warriors to be attacked.

If the number is odd (3, 5) then his
opponent must choose one of the controlling player’s
warriors to be attacked.

Note it is always the player whose
turn it is that is attacked by spirits, the only difference is
whether or not he or his opponent chooses the affected
model.

An attacked warrior is automatically hit by a Strength 2
attack that ignores armour saves and is blown directly backwards
D6". If an attacked warrior is in an elevated position such as
a gantry or an upper floor of a building then there is a good
chance he may be blown off and if this is the case treat the
model as falling.

If a model is blown into a piece of terrain
(such as a mound of rubble or the wall of a building) or
blown into another warrior, friend or foe, then the warrior (or
both warriors if it hits another model) is knocked down but
may get up at the start of his next turn should he survive.


##### Ending the game
When when all warbands but one have routed.

##### Experience

**+1 Grizzly Trophy** If an Hero manages to stay on the gallows (or the piece of terrain representing the gallows) at the centre of the square for one complete turn then they gain +1 Experience. (Limit 1 per warrior).

# The Great Library
</div>

_The North-East Quarter of Mordheim was renowned for trade and
learning. When Mordheim was a living city, the crowded labyrinth
of streets and market plazas were called the Merchant's Quarter,
more commonly known as the District of the Flying Horse.
Mordheim became known as the finest market of the city in the
Empire, rivalling even the busiest ports as Marienburg. There were
many traders who would claim that for the right price they could
locate any object for you so desired in a day.
Another notable aspect of the North-Eastern Quarter was the Great
Library. During the rule of the extravagant Count Ignatius
Steinhardt, the library grew extensively to become the largest
building in the entire city. The Count was particularly fond of
collecting mystical and religious tomes. Of course, unwittingly, The
Great Library managed to collect on of the largest deposits of
Daemonic and Necromantic lore in the Empire.
Now after the disaster struck Mordheim Library was engulfed by
flames from the comet. Only the bravest ever consider going
anywhere near the ruins but the lure of ancient tomes is enough to
persuade mages from across the Empire to hire warbands to
retrieve any books that they can find. For enough gold, fools can
find enough bravery to risk even this dark place._

##### Terrain
Set up as normal, with no special features.

##### Special Rules
Players should then place D3 +1 Tomes for each warband
involved in the game on the tabletop to represent where the
Tomes are. Each player takes it in turn to place a Tome
counter.

The counters must be placed more than 10” away
from the edge of the table and at least 6” away from each
other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which
edge the warbands will play from. 

A warrior can carry any
amount of Tomes without any penalty. Warriors cannot
transfer their Tomes to another warrior. If a warrior is put
OOA then the Tome is placed next to where the model was
taken OOA. The Tomes cause FEAR.  This is
to represent the great unknown on whether or not the Tomes
are Evil. 

To represent the chaotic nature of the disaster and
the many magic tomes that are scattered in the area warbands
will roll on the Random Happenings.
Warbands will begin rolling on the Random Happenings
chart when the first model touches a tome and will continue
then at the beginning of each warbands turn. Yes, the first
warband that touches a Tome will roll on the Random
Happenings chart even though it will already be in the middle
of their turn.

```
```
##### Set-Up
Players use the normal warband set-up rules. Special deployment may not be used for this scenario, as whatever they think they have scouted probably will probably have changed by the time their comrades arrive.

##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6 to determine who goes first. Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

##### Ending the game
The game ends when all the warbands but one have failed
their Rout Test. Warbands that Rout automatically lose. 

##### Experience
**+1 Per each Tome Picked Up:** If a Hero or Henchmen is carrying at least one Tome counter at the end of the game or managed to carry it off of the board they receive +1 Experience.
**+1 For the Warband with the Most Tomes:** The leader of the warband with the most tomes at the end of the game gains +1 Experience.

### Ill Gotten Gains...
You can sell the Tomes for 25 +1D6 or choose to keep the
scroll. If you keep a scroll then roll on the chart below (1D6).
Rolling on the chart below will represent that the Hero has
decided to open the scroll and is trying to decipher its
abilities. Please nominate which Hero will be opening the
scroll.
D6 Events
1. The Hero who keeps the scroll will set out the next
    game. You may come up with some creative on why
    he cannot play the next game from opening the scroll.
2. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain +1 Initiative.
    This can take you above our racial Maximum.
3-5. The Hero who keeps the scroll will gain an Academic
    Skill. Those who normally cannot gain a Academic
    Skill can gain one (1) Academic Skill. Please note that
    this is for only one time and does not grant the user to
    gain Academic Skills through normal experience.
6. The Hero who opens the scroll will gain D3
    experience.

# The Middle Bridge
</div>

_The Middle Bridge is the main crossing point for the City of the
Damned. Whoever holds the bridge controls all aspects of movement
in Mordheim. The bridge is rumoured to have piles of Wyrdstone or
Treasure around it but are said to be guarded by massive Trolls,
who have a strange affinity for bridges._

#### Terrain
This scenario works best in groups of no more than 4 players. While certainly possible to play with more it is advised to re-roll the scenario if your games group has more than 4 players.

Set up a narrow street (approx 5" wide is best) with buildings on either side. In games with more than two players you will need to set up a junction in the middle of the board, allowing routes for each warband - a Middle Bridge with four players would therefore need to be a crossroad. As best you can, try to set this junction up in such a way that each warband will have about the same distance to travel if they intend on reaching the opposite board edge.

Any area that is not part of any of the buildings and is not in the street is considered water features due to the flooding. It will be important to establish with the other players what is or isn't these watery areas before rolling for deployment.


##### Set-up
Players roll a D6 each, the highest roller deploys first. Warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the
street.

##### Special Rules
Place D3 +1 Trolls for each warband in the water and within
6” inches of the bridge. Place 1 Troll for each warband in the
middle of the bridge and the remainder Trolls should be
placed in the water. 	
**Fog:** The area is covered in a fog so putric and thick that visibility is almost nothing. Movement and
shooting distance are halved, though you may charge as normal.	
**They're growing..!:** The longer the Trolls are left alone the more Wyrdstone they are exposed to. Mutations grow, and the poor beasts grow into vast, slavering hulks. If more than 10 games have occured in the campaign, they get +1 to all their stats.	
**River Trolls:** Enemies are at -1 To Hit against River Trolls.

```
```

#### Starting the game
Players each roll a D6 to determine who goes first. Play
proceeds clockwise around the table from there. The Trolls will always go last.

##### Ending the game
When all warbands but one have routed, the last remaining warband may continue to attempt to clear the area of Trolls. (Limit: 2 turns). If they fail to clear the area then the scenario is a draw.

If all the Trolls are dead and only one warband remains, then they win the scenario.

##### Experience
There are no additional special bonuses for this scenario.

### Winning Warband Rewards
The winning warband may gain a onetime 6D6 gold. This will represent collecting tolls from other warbands and merchants who peddle their wares, and will be able to choose the next scenario they play by hearing rumours from travellers passing through.

# Last Orders!
</div>

_It can be found on the ambiguous borders of the
Chaos Wastes. Managed by coolheaded landlord
Knute Alsgaard, the Last Hope inn remains neutral
ground, a sanctuary where in theory, anyone is
permitted to enter. Quite how this tavern ended up in Mordheim, and identifiably unchanged, is endemic of just how far reality has bent and buckled under the impact of so much Wyrdstone. It is as much a fortress as it is a watering
hole for exiles._

##### Terrain
The site of this ‘battle’ should consist of two or three
sections, at least 10” x 10”, and not needing to be
more than 18” x 18”. There is one section to represent
each floor of the inn.
The ground floor is the location of the bar room. It
should be relatively open.

It should include a bar, a
few tables plus several chairs or benches scattered
around. Stairs lead up to the upper floor. There might
be a wine cellar, a kitchen, a store room or a lavatory.

The upper floor of the inn consists of a series of
rooms off a main hallway. Each room might include a
bed. Add other furnishings you desire. Do not forget
to include a marker to represent the top of the stairs
from below. Add another set of stairs to the next level
if you have one! The Last Hope is a fortress so it has
another floor, which is in the open air. The roof! 

##### Warbands
Animals and Mounts are not permitted inside the tavern.


##### Set-Up
The warbands are scattered about the inn when the
trouble starts. Randomly determine which floor of the
inn each warband member begins on. Then each
player takes turns placing each warrior in his warband.
Warriors may not be placed in hand-to-hand combat. 

##### Starting the Game
Each player rolls a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn. 

```
```
##### Special Rules
**Diving Charges:** Warriors may always attempt a Diving Charge from the tables and bar, irrespective of the
height of the furniture. Stairs may also be used.	
**Unarmed:** All weapons have been confiscated for this game. Armour can be worn including helmets and
shields. Miscellaneous equipment can be carried.	
**Weapons Amnesty:** Due to the generally non-lethal nature of the weapons used in this fight, players
should roll twice for Injury for each warrior taken out
of action during the game, and choose the best result.
Injuries for Heroes are rolled twice. In some cases,
which result is determined to be the best may be
something the player has to decide for himself!	
**Improvised weapons:** Being forbidden to bring their weapons into the bar
means that the warriors must make do with whatever
comes to hand in the Last Hope. At the start of any
turn, a warrior can search the inn for a blunt
implement to use as a bludgeoning weapon. This
could be a bowl, a stein, a cooking ladle, the leg of a
chair or a local codger’s walking stick!). Only warriors
capable of gaining experience may attempt to search.

If a search is attempted the warrior may not charge.
Roll a D6: on a 3-6 the fighter finds something
suitable, but on a 1-2 nothing close by will work and
the warrior will have to make do with his fists. A
warrior searching for a weapon in combat will strike
last that turn, regardless of success. A warrior with a
weapon may not improvise another. If a weapon is
found, treat it as a club with the following features:
> **Range:** Hand-to-hand; **Strength:** As User
##### Special Rules
**Breakable:** If the warrior attempts a close combat
attack with an improvised weapon and rolls a 1 to hit,
the item has broken and becomes useless. The warrior
must resort to his fists for the rest of the combat and
may search for another weapon in the next turn.	
**Projectile:** Alternatively, a warrior may treat the Projectile:
improvised weapon as a missile. The weapon is
automatically lost after it has been thrown. A weapon
is thrown as a missile using the following features.	
**Range:** 6”; **Strength:** As user;	
**Special Rules:** Thrown Weapon 

##### Ending the Game
The warriors have been indulging in the inn's
refreshments and are now very refreshed indeed! No Rout tests are necessary – the winner is the player with the last standing model. Any player may voluntarily rout if the excitement becomes too much. 

##### Experience
There are no special experience bonuses for this scenario.

# Statue of St. Voller
</div>

_The story of Saint Voller is all but lost to history, the documentation of her works largely kept within the great libraries of Mordheim. Folklore and myth is all that survives by way of her legacy, but whatever the truth may have been she is revered by the Cult of Morr as one of their matron saints. Her statue was a place of pilgrimage to many who prayed that the dead keep their rest, and due to the wild and wonton magical experimentation present in Mordheim before the meteor strike her blessings were desperately sought after lest a lost loved one be forced to live an eternity of servitude at the hands of some vile necromancer some day. When the statue miraculously survived the meteor strike many survivors deemed it a blessing of Morr itself, and survivors brought their dead by the cartload to the statue in the hopes that their deaths be consecrated and their souls kept safe. Bodies piled the pavements, and with no safe way out of the city to bury them the surrounding buildings became macabre warehouses stacked to the rafters with corpses simply to keep the roads clear._

_So many dead and dying in one place was never going to end well. The sheer concentration of corpses and the opportunity to desecrate a shrine to a hated nemesis drew the attention of necromancers even beyond the city walls, and for a few mortifying months the plaza surrounding the statue became a Mecca for necromancers looking to practice their arts and refresh their supply of corpses. The district is lost to the undead now, for whatever riches it may hold simply aren't worth the inevitable wall of attrition that the thousands of reanimated corpses can provide, save for the statue itself. The Statue of Saint Voller maintains the properties of her patron god Morr, an anathema to all things undead. Undead who approach find their souls drained from their bodies, eventually disintegrating into nothingness without their sustenance. Harnessing the power of this statue or corrupting it to your own ends will prove a valuable asset within the City of The Damned, but warbands will need to move quickly. Noise awakens the unquiet dead within these sardine-packed buildings._

##### Terrain
The city is set up as per regular Mordheim. In the centre of the battlefield should be a
large statue – the shrine representing Saint Voller.

##### Starting the game
Roll a D6, the highest roll goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise. Special deployment rules may not be used for this scenario, no scout would be mad enough to camp out in a warehouse so zombie-infested that there's no room to stand.
```
```
##### Special rules
**The Unquiet Dead:** At the end of each round turn every building's occupants will begin to stir. Gnarled and withered hands pull at boarded-up windows, and mindless groans dryly echo through the decreasingly deserted streets. For every building on the map roll a D6. On a result of a 1 or 2 D3+1 Zombies will emerge, touching the building and placed between it and the nearest Warband member. This counts as their movement action. If a Warband Member is in the building and is not Hidden then the Unquiet Dead subtract 2 from the roll to see if they emerge. If the nearest Warband member is inside the building then all emerging zombies from that building will immediately go into combat with them, counting as charging, and dividing up between all warband members inside. These Zombies are the same as the Henchmen from the Undead warband, though they do not grant any Experience for taking Out of Action.	
**Shhhhh!:** The Unquiet Dead ironically prefer peace and quiet, being drawn to attack sources of noise nearby. If a Blackpowder Weapon is fired the nearest two buildings to the character who fired will immediately spawn zombies as if they had just rolled a 1 or 2 in the Unquiet Dead turn. 	
**The Statue of Saint Voller:** Though Mordheim is lost and a wholly depraved place, the spirit of Saint Voller still exerts some guardianship. Unquiet Dead will never voluntarily move within 4" of the statue, and any Undead model that ends its movement phase within this zone must take a leadership test (they may use their warband leader's leadership). For every point they fail by they suffer a wound with no armour saves allowed. The statue itself holds an inky black pendant swimming with grey and purple shadows, a Talisman of Saint Voller. This talisman may be retrieved as if it was a shard of wyrdstone, with all the same rules as wyrdstone from the Wyrdstone Hunt.

##### Ending the game
The game ends when either all warbands but one have failed their rout tests, or if a character escapes the board with the Talisman of Saint Voller. If a warband is holding the talisman when all others rout they may keep it.

The Talisman of Saint Voller when worn by a non-Undead character causes Terror in Undead models, even though they would usually be immune to psychology. When worn by an Undead warband leader their warband will never crumble due to the loss of a Necromancer or Heirophant, even if the leader is taken Out of Action - their studying of Morr and corruption of Voller's Talisman has made their soul-binding more potent than ever before!

##### Experience
There are no special experience bonuses.

# Merchant Square
</div>

_The once thriving Market Square, more commonly known as the
District of the Flying Horse has become a deserted plaza. Only the
exceptionally brave or downright foolhardy dare cross the open
cobbles, where once thousands of merchants sole their wares. To
venture into the Market Square is to expose oneself to all those who
keep a close watch from the surrounding shadow. Many eyes peer
from the dark alleys and ruined buildings, in search of a fresh
opportunity to make a quick killing. There is still a vast quantity of
precious and exotic goods lying in the broken cellars of merchant's
houses for the taking.
It is said that a few of the Pegasi escaped the destruction and their
cages and have made their lairs around this area. Some have
mutated horribly and are twisted diabolic parodies of their former
selves. The infamous of these creatures is said to be a huge Black
Pegasus with several additional horribly mutated heads, that of a
serpent and a ram. Hunger gnaws at the stomachs of these beasts
and they will face many times their number if they catch the scent of
prey._

_In a terrible twist of fate, the Merchants Quarter remains the most
opulent region of the accursed city. Should any adventurous soul
wish to visit the ruined library or take a chance and stroll through
the market place, it is highly likely that they may discover some rare
goods that have survived the fall. Leaving the quarter with your life
is a different matter though, for the District of the Flying Horse is
also rich pickings for those who seek to spill blood._

##### Terrain
Set up as normal, however the middle
area of the board should free of terrain (maybe a fountain or
the like to mark the centre of the square) and to have at least
a 12” inch x 12” inch square open area. This will represent the Merchant's Square. The buildings placed outside of the
Merchant's Square will represent the Merchant's Homes and Shoppe's.

##### Set-Up
Players set up as normal.	

```
```

##### Special rules
Warbands will begin searching the buildings for common
items. Each warband will roll 1D6 for each searchable building. If they roll a 4+ they found a common item. Make a note of how many common items you have retrieved, then roll them at the end of the game. In the middle of the Merchant's Square will be D3 Treasure Chests per warband.

When a warband touches a chest they must roll a D6, only rolling once per chest. On a roll of a 1 on a D6, the Black Pegasus will appear - this replaces the traps found in the Raven Barracks chests. 

The Black Pegasus will appear 8” in on a Random Table edge. The Black Pegasus will go in the last turn and will attempt to fly down on the models in the Merchant's Square. The Black Pegasus will target the closest model in the Merchant's Square. Merchant's Square is the 12” x 12” area in the middle of the table as the streets and alleys would be too narrow for the Pegasus to fly into.

If the Black Pegasus is encountered after 10 games have been played in the campaign then it gains +1 to each of its attributes. 


##### Starting the game
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest has the
first turn and order of play proceeds clockwise around the
table (based on where the players placed their warbands).

##### Ending the game
The game ends if only one warband remains, or if all Treasure Chests leave the board. If only one warband remains they have 2 turns to pick up those dropped by fleeing warbands. Once those turns expire, the game ends. 

The winning warband is the one that acquired the most Treasure Chest at the end of the battle. It is therefore theoretically possible to rout and yet still win.

##### Experience

**+1 Per Crate captured:** If a Hero or Henchmen takes a crate off the battlefield they earn +1 Experience. They do not get this bonus for holding the chests at the end of the game.

### The Spoils!
Common Items from Houses:
1. D3 Morningstars.
2. D3 Spears.
3. D3 Bows.
4. D3 Crossbows.
5. 1 Suit of Heavy Armour.
6. D3 Nets.

Treasure Chest Items:

1. D3 Repeater Crossbows.
2. D3 Handguns.
3. D3 Healing Herbs.
4. 1 Gromril Dwarf Axe.
5. 1 Bugman's Ale.
6. 1 Forest Cloak.

# Getting Personal
</div>

This scenario is designed for campaign games with any number of players present. A personal dispute has erupted between several famous/infamous characters in Mordheim, and eager to profit from the spoils of this sort of carnage the warbands have rushed in to pick at the remains. Unfortunately they appear to have been rather swept up in it all, and with famous names aligning themselves with warbands unexpectedly they find themselves in the midst of a sudden brawl!

Terrain
The board is set up as per normal Mordheim.

Set-up
Warbands deploy in their usual locations
.
Warbands
In this scenario each warband is joined by a randomly selected character from the list of MVPs! These characters are completely controlled by the owning player, though they are treated independently from your warband. They do not count for the purposes of either warband size or as losses for routing, and if your warband routs then the player may continue to play as the MVP. They also will not drop their unique items when defeated. 

Starting the game
Determined as normal.

Ending the game
The game ends if either one warband remains and all other MVPs have been taken out of action, or if all warbands are routed and there are only MVPs left on the board. In this case there are no winners.

If a warband wins the scenario AND their MVP is still alive then they recieve a bonus 3xp to be distributed as they see fit among their heroes as the MVP thanks them after the battle and tells them some stories!

# The Canals
</div>


##### Setup
This scenario may only be played with an even number of players.

This map takes place using four tiles. Leave an 8" gap between them running down the middle of the board, this represents the canal. The middle of the board will feature buildings equal to half the number of players, with long walkways offering crossings over the canal. These are the only crossing points, and are what the warbands are seeking to control. The rest of the board should feature dense terrain.

##### Deployment
The warbands deploy up to 12" towards the canal from the corners and 8" towards the opposite table edge. Scout, Infiltrate, and Hunch may not be used in this scenario.

##### Special Rules
The syrupy swamp-thick muck of Mordheim's polluted canal is home to monsters disgustingly mutated and horrific enough to chill a vampire's marrow. 

At the start of each round turn (before the first player's go) roll a dice for each warband member in the canal. If any of these results is a 1, then the Abomination has arrived. 

Randomize which end of the canal it emerges from and it will then move as quickly as possible towards the opposite table edge engaging in combat with nearest model where possible. It is unaffected by the difficult terrain, and if its movement takes it to the table edge it will stop and then turn around. It will repeat this patrolling action until the game is over or it is taken out of action.

Before the comet struck the canals were infamous for their vile pollution, the canal's waters so contaminated with sewage and alchemical reagents' run-off that even droughted beggars wouldn't consider drinking it. The latent wyrdstone energies brought about by the cataclysmic meteor have hardly improved things, transforming the waters into a toxic slurry that coats the flagstones around it like bile.

Attempting to leave the canal will require a climbing check as warband members struggle to find purchase on the smooth treacherous stone. This means it requires an initiative test, and mounted units will be unable to exit at all as they become bogged down in the goop. Alternatively a friendly model of the same or larger unit type can move into contact with them and take a strength test to pull them free (good luck pulling an ogre out of a swamp, Brian.)

Additionally the waters are so blighted and foul that all Nurgle-aligned models suffer from Stupidity while inside it as they wantonly revel in the filth.

```
```

##### Starting the Game
Players roll off as normal, then play proceeds clockwise.

##### Ending the game 
After eight turns the game will end. A warband has won the scenario if either it controls at least three objective buildings by the end of the eighth turn (only contains warband members owned by the player) or is the last warband remaining.

##### Rewards:
**+1xp for Occupation:** If the game ends by turn limit then for each building a warband controls it can give a bonus XP point to one of its occupying members. 	
**Extort Tolls:** Warbands that do not rout by the end of the game gain 30 gold per building they control.

| |2D6 | 4 | 0| 6| 6 | 5 | 1 | 2D6 | 10 |
##### Special Rules:
**Ravenous Maw:** The Abomination's great slavering orophice is yawning enough to acommodate the largest prey. There is nothing beyond its appetites. It therefore has the Heroic Killing Blow ability.
**Magical Monstrosity:** The Abomination is a Chaos Spawn so mutated by the twisting of reality caused by the saturation of Wyrdstone energy that the very Winds of Magic distort and tear around it. The Abomination has Magic Resistance (4).	
**Gargantuan:** The Abomination is _Gargantuan_ sized.	
**No Pain:** The Abomination ignores all Knocked Down and Stunned results, instead reducing its attacks characteristic to D6 until the Abomination's next turn.

**Immune to Psychology**	
**Terror**

# Monsters of Mordheim
</div>


### Chaos Spawn
_Chaos Spawn are followers of chaos who have failed to pleases
their gods. They have been mutated into a hideous mass of limbs,
appendages and all manner of mutations. Their minds are gone,
leaving nothing but a seething mass of bone and flesh._

| Profile | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| |2D6| 3| 0| 4| 5| 3| 2| D6+1|10|
##### Special Rules
**Fear:**	
**Immune to Psychology:**	
**Movement:** To move a spawn, roll a Scatter die and move it 2D6" in that direction, moving around obstacles as necessary. Should the Scatter die come up with a 'hit' the Spawn moves directly towards the nearest visible enemy model on the table.	
**Skull of Steel:** In any turn in which the spawn rolls an
injury result of “Knocked Down” or “Stunned”, ignore the
result, instead reduce the monster's attacks to a D3 result,
instead of the D6+1 given in the profile. This hindrance will
continue until the Spawn's next turn, then it is removed.	
**Large:** Chaos Spawn are _Large_ sized.
##### Experience
**+1 For wounding the Beast:** Any Hero or Henchman earns +1 Experience for each wound he inflicts on the Chaos Spawn.	
**+1 For taking the Beast out of action:** The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Chaos Spawn out of action gets a
bonus +1 experience.


 

### Forest Spirits
_Forest Spirits inhabit the trees of the forests of the Old World. In
their solid form, they resemble a miniature version of a Treeman,
with soft, damp woody flesh. They are very violent if threatened and
will use their branch like arms with claws of sharp thorns and twigs
to their best advantage._

##### Experience
**+1 For wounding:** Any Hero or Henchman earns
+1 Experience for each wound he inflicts.	
**+1 For slaying:** The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Shadow Dryads out of
action gets a bonus +1 experience.




### Harpies
_The Harpies are jealously protective of the wyrdstone in their nest.
If any model approaches within their charge range then they will
charge. The Harpies will try and coordinate their attacks so at least
one stays back and protects the nest. Therefore, a Harpy may
disengage from a fallen enemy model if there is an opportunity for
one of its companions to charge another model._

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| | 4| 4| 0| 4| 4| 1| 2| 2| 6|
##### Special Rules:
**Talons**: A Harpy has talons and is accustomed to fighting
unarmed so does not suffer a penalty for doing so.	
**Fly:** A Harpy may fly up to 12". After the Movement phase
the model is assumed to have landed and may be charged. If
on the ground, a Harpy may make a full move and then use
its wings.	
**Drop Attack:** If a Harpy is successful with both attacks in
the first round of combat then the Harpy has successfully
grabbed on to her enemy and swoops back up in the air to
drop the model allowing gravity to do the work instead. The
attacks themselves do not wound, but the person controlling
the Harpy immediately rolls a D6 and a Scatter dice. That is
the distance and direction from the place where the attack
took place that the model will rest.

Next the player
controlling the Harpy rolls another D6. This is the distance
from which the model has been dropped. The result is the
Strength of hit (Strength 1 to Strength 6). Normal falling
rules apply. If a model falls into a building than count the fall
to where they land and then determine if the model falls again
if it is within 1" of the edge of the floor. Any model that is
struck by the dropped model will suffer a S3 hit. 

Large
targets may only be dropped D3 inches since their size and
weight make them more difficult to pick up. Once its
opponent is dropped the Harpy may continue flying and
return to the nest, preparing for another attack. 

Models that
are stunned or knocked down will not be charged as it is too
difficult for the Harpy to fly that close to the ground and do a
drop attack.

##### Experience
**+1 For slaying:** The Hero or
Henchman that puts the Harpy out of action gets a bonus +1
expereence.

### River Trolls
_Trolls are large and foul creatures, with gangling limbs and cold,
damp hides. Renowned for their strength and unthinking ferocity,
Trolls can rip a man apart with their bare hands. Trolls are able to
regenerate damaged flesh, and so are all but impossible to kill. Not
only that, they have the ability to vomit the corrosive contents over
their victim, melting armour, flesh and bone with ease. One
particularly vicious form of Troll is the Stone Troll, whose hide is as
tough as rock. They have the strange ability of sucking the very
power of magic out of the surrounding area. River Trolls live in the
marshlands or swamps near the banks of rivers. Their flesh exhumes
a vile slime which chokes anyone nearby._

##### Special Rules
**Immune to Psychology**
**Fear**
**Regeneration:** Trolls have a 4+ Ward Save against non-flaming attacks.	
**Vomit Attack:** If a Troll is in combat with just one opponent it will Vomit rather than attack normally. Vomit is a single automatic hit at the Troll's strength that ignores Armour Saves.	
**Slime:** Foes are at -1 To Hit in melee against River Trolls.
**Aquatic:** River Trolls may move through water terrain with
no penalty, and count as being in cover whilst they are in the
water.
